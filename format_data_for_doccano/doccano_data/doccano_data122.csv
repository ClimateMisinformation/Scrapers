"The extraordinary Gore-Palmer drama began about 10 weeks ago when the quietly spoken but very effective former Australian Conservation Foundation head, Don Henry, approached a former adviser to Tony Windsor, John Clements, to ask whether he could open a line of communication with Clive Palmer. Henry is an international board member of Gore’s “climate reality project”. Clements and Windsor had struck up a friendly relationship with Palmer during the last parliament. Palmer’s three senators held the key to the future of most of Australia’s existing climate change legislation. It was an unusual, but potentially powerful, mix.  Clements was sceptical – was the conservationist just lining up to have a go at Palmer? He was persuaded the dialogue would be serious. Phone calls began, between Henry and Palmer and between Palmer and Gore. Would the Palmer United party (PUP) keep the clean energy finance corporation, the climate change authority, even the emissions trading scheme in a kind of hibernating state in preparation for tougher international action? Just over two weeks ago Ben Oquist, now strategy director at the Australia Institute but previously chief of staff to Greens leaders Bob Brown and Christine Milne and a canny political and parliamentary operator, flew to Brisbane to share a Japanese lunch with Palmer and his media adviser Andrew Crook. Should he meet Gore, Palmer asked, as the three discussed the details of climate policy. The talks with Henry culminated in a meeting last Thursday at the Hyatt Hotel in Canberra, down the road from parliament house, between Henry, Palmer, Clements and Crook, where the broad outline of Wednesday’s PUP announcements were discussed, as well as the idea of a joint press conference with Gore, who was already in Australia for a “climate reality” workshop. But the details fluctuated wildly over the coming days. Palmer had been willing to consider keeping the existing emissions trading scheme but his senators, who met over the weekend, insisted it had to be repealed in the first instance because that is what they had clearly promised the electorate. Gore then wavered about the idea of standing at a podium beside the leader of a party that was promising to repeal the world-class carbon pricing scheme. At the last minute he was convinced to go ahead because PUP was promising to reintroduce the scheme in a different form in the near future and had also agreed to retain the renewable energy target, which it had previously intended to try to abolish, and which the government has been preparing to dramatically wind back. And so it came about that Gore and Palmer, an unlikely duo, stood at a podium to announce the certain repeal of Australia's carbon pricing scheme and the very uncertain possibility that an emissions trading scheme would be reintroduced sometime in the future. And then they all left for dinner in the members dining room: Gore, Palmer, Henry, Oquist, Clements, the Palmer United party senator-elect and former rugby league player, Glenn Lazarus, the independent member for Indi, Cathy McGowan, the Queensland green campaigner Drew Hutton and Gore's and Palmer’s staff. The exact details of the new PUP policy are still being finalised: the amendment to force power price reductions and just how the party thinks it could possibly reintroduce an ETS. The carbon price will almost certainly be repealed. Direct Action is likely to go down as well. But some parts of the current climate change laws will be retained: the CEFC, the independent climate change authority and the RET. The parliament is in the throes of repealing the carbon price, everyone re-running the same arguments they have been making for the past five years. But in the background the carbon pricing debate is being dramatically reframed."

"Tony Abbott doesn’t take climate science seriously and the repeal of the carbon price is “reckless” and “deeply shaming”, according to a former UK Conservative party environment minister. Lord Deben, who served in Margaret Thatcher’s government as John Gummer, told Guardian Australia the Australian government was out of step with centre-right politicians from around the world on the urgency of tackling climate change.  “I haven’t met an Australian who is not deeply ashamed of this government, most of whom voted for Abbott,” he said. “How can you say ‘we don’t mind what 97% of scientists tell us, we are going to stick two fingers up and do it anyway’? “Conservatives around the world are taking action on climate change, including Britain and Germany. It’s in the DNA of conservatives to hand on a better world to your children and I hate that Australia is letting down conservatives around the world.” Deben said he met Abbott last year, when the prime minister was opposition leader, to gauge his position in climate change. “Quite clearly, he was someone who refuses to accept the science of climate change,” said Deben, who is chairman of the UK’s Committee on Climate Change. “He referred to ideas put forward by a small number of people whose views aren’t accepted by any serious scientist in the world. “I think future generations will ask ‘what did you do to stop the world being overwhelmed by climate change?’. Mr Abbott will have to answer that and I don’t know how he can look at children in the eye. His attitude, if everyone else did the same, would condemn the poorest people in the world to an impossible life. “I don’t think conservatives have ever taken that view before. Australia, as a great country, knows better than that, I think.” Deben, who was UK environment secretary from 1993 to 1997, said the upcoming repeal of Australia’s carbon price was “deeply shaming”. “It’s a reckless and deeply retrograde step,” he said. “There has been a notable reduction in emissions and businesses have not found it to be the imposition that they said it would be. “There’s nothing in the [Coalition’s] alternative policy that makes anyone believe they will hit the target of 5% reduction in emissions by 2020, which is manifestly inadequate anyway. “I mean, when you’ve even got small, poor countries such as Kiribati and Micronesia doing their part to reduce emissions, what on Earth is Australia doing?” Abbott has stressed that he accepts the science and wants to tackle climate change, but not “clobber” the economy while doing so. Abbott’s office has been contacted for a response to Deben’s comments. The Coalition has argued that the carbon price has been a costly imposition on the Australian economy, reducing emissions by just 0.1% in the two years of its operation. Supporters of carbon pricing, however, point out that emissions from electricity generation, which is the main target of the mechanism, have dropped by 11% in this time. Bodies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have backed carbon pricing as the most economically efficient way of reducing emissions. A spokeswoman for Ed Davey, the UK’s climate change minister, told Guardian Australia that Britain was committed to the Europe-wide emissions trading scheme. “We will continue to work with Australia on achieving an ambitious global agreement in 2015,” she said. “The UK supports the development of carbon pricing around the world as the most cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and incentivising the technologies required for the transition to a low carbon economy.” The Coalition wants to replace carbon pricing with its Direct Action policy, a voluntary fund that will pay businesses that wish to reduce their emissions. The government insists Direct Action will meet the 5% emissions target, although several independent analyses have cast doubt on this and the Department of Environment has admitted it has no modelling to prove the scheme will meet the goal. It’s uncertain whether the new senate will vote for Direct Action, due to opposition from Labor, the Greens and Palmer United party. Coalition attempts to scrap the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Renewable Energy Agency, the two main renewable energy agencies, could also be thwarted in the Senate. "

"Name: Redheads. Age: As old as the recessive gene on Chromosome 16 that induces a mutation in the MC1R protein that results in gingerfication.  Appearance: From pale orange to coppery fire to burnished auburn. Why are redheads in the news? Is it another Rebekah Brooks thing? No. Then they're either complaining about being an oppressed minority … No Or someone has said something about them all becoming extinct in the next 50 years. Bit longer than that, but yes, that's it! How did you know? People are always saying it. What's the supposed cause this time? Rarity of the gene? Unpopularity in the mating pool? Low takeup among artificial insemination users of sperm donations from carrot-tops? I've heard 'em all. Climate change. Turns out I haven't heard 'em all. Continue. The theory is that red hair (and blue eyes) evolved in countries with generally bad, cloudy weather to maximise the amount of vitamin D a body could take in. Which is why Scotland, for example, has a 13% redhead-rate compared with a worldwide frequency of just 1-2%. And so? As Scotland and elsewhere becomes brighter due to climate change … Redheads razzle to death in the sun? Red hair will result in no advantage and their sensitivity to UV light may make them more prone to skin cancer, resulting in a centuries-long process of breeding out the gene rather than a series of fiery deaths but yes; one way or another – sayonara, Rufus. I'm no scientist and I hate to be rude but – this sounds so theoretical as to being in peril of stepping over the line into the Land of Complete Nonsense. How dare you! Although… Yes? Well, we have invented sunscreen. And climate change doesn't necessarily equate to more sun. And most skin cancers occur after your childbearing days are over so there will be nothing preventing the gene reproducing. Mmm? Inuits have retained their darker skins in even bleaker climes than Scotland so sun can't have much to do with it. So there's no real story at all, is that right? Pretty much. Well, I think we've all learned something here today. I'll get my coat. Do say: Molly Ringwald! Julianne Moore! Damian Lewis! Don't say: You could dye it brown, you know. • This article was amended on 16 July 2014 to remove a line which said Dr Alistair Moffat, managing director of ScotlandsDNA, reckoned red hair was on its way out. His BritainsDNA team, which has been studying the frequency of red hair gene variants, has no historic data and therefore no evidence to suggest that red hair is dying out because of climate change. We were rather premature in awarding him a doctorate."

"The first success of the environmental movements of the 1960s was to save the whale. Now, with deep irony, whales may be about to save us with their poo. A new scientific report from the University of Vermont, which gathers together several decades of research, shows that the great whales which nearly became extinct in the 20th century – and are now recovering in number due to the 1983 ban on whaling – may be the enablers of massive carbon sinks via their prodigious production of faeces. Not only do the nutrients in whale poo feed other organisms, from phytoplankton upwards – and thereby absorb the carbon we humans are pumping into the atmosphere – even in death the sinking bodies of these massive animals create new resources on the sea bed, where entire species exist solely to graze on rotting whale. There's an additional and direct benefit for humans, too. Contrary to the suspicions of fishermen that whales take their catch, cetacean recovery could ""lead to higher rates of productivity in locations where whales aggregate to feed and give birth"". Their fertilizing faeces here, too, would encourage phytoplankton which in turn would encourage healthier fisheries.  Such propositions speak to our own species' arrogance. As demonstrated in the fantastical geoengineering projects dreamed up to address climate change, the human race's belief that the world revolves around it knows no bounds. What if whales were nature's ultimate geoengineers? The new report only underlines what has been suspected for some time: that cetaceans, both living and dead, are ecosystems in their own right. But it also raises a hitherto unexplored prospect, that climate change may have been accelerated by the terrible whale culls of the 20th century, which removed hundreds of thousands of these ultimate facilitators of CO2 absorption. As Greg Gatenby, the acclaimed Canadian writer on whales told me in response to the Vermont report, ""about 300,000 blue whales were taken in the 20th century. If you average each whale at 100 tons, that makes for the removal from the ocean of approximately 30m tons of biomass. And that's just for one species"". There's another irony here, too. American whaling, as celebrated in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), declined in part because of the discovery of mineral oil wells in the second half of the 19th century. One unsustainable resource – the whale oil which lit and lubricated the industrial revolution – was replaced by another. By killing so many whales, then turning to carbon-emitting mineral oil, humans created a double-whammy for climate change. (Conversely, and perhaps perversely, some US commentators have claimed that capitalism saved the whales rather than environmentalists. They contend that our use of mineral oil actually alleviated the pressure on whale populations – proof, they say, that human ingenuity has the ultimate power to solve the planet's problems). The 10 scientists who jointly contributed to the new paper note the benefits of ""an ocean repopulated by the great whales"". Working on a whalewatching boat off Cape Cod last month, I witnessed astonishing numbers of fin whales, humpbacks and minkes feeding on vast schools of sand eels. I watched dozens of whales at a time, co-operatively hoovering up the bait – and producing plentiful clouds of poo in the process. (Having been at the receiving end of a defecating sperm whale, I can testify to its richly odiferous qualities.) Observers in the Azores have reported similarly remarkable concentrations of cetaceans this summer. And with a 10% increase in humpback calves returning to Australian waters each year, and blue whales being seen in the Irish Sea, a burgeoning global population of cetaceans might not just be good for the whalewatching industry, they may play a significant role in the planet's rearguard action against climate change. It would certainly be a generous return on their part, given what we've inflicted on them. Indeed, as Melville imagined in his prophetic chapter in Moby-Dick, Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?, the whale might yet have the last laugh, regaining its reign in a flooded world of the future to ""spout his frothed defiance to the skies""."

"A new coalition of 20 organisations from the construction, housing and environment sectors has called on the government to make it a national priority to retrofit a million badly insulated homes a year by 2020. In an open letter to Lord Deighton, commercial secretary to the Treasury, the coalition argues that by this move the government would not only cut rocketing energy bills, and so reduce fuel poverty, but also help to tackle climate change and create thousands of jobs in every constituency.  It would also lead to strengthened energy security and less dependence on fossil fuels in the UK, the group says. The organisations, led by the UK Green Building Council and including well-known environmental groups such as Greenpeace and WWF, say the UK has consistently had one of the worst records on fuel poverty in Europe, with 2.5 million households affected in 2014. Households that suffer from fuel poverty are defined by the government as having to spend more than 10% of their combined income on energy for adequate living conditions. Fuel poverty is caused by low household income, high energy costs and poor energy efficiency. The coalition's scheme would mean 90% of such homes being lifted out of fuel poverty, the coalition says."

"Christine Milne's offer to Tony Abbott, of a double dissolution trigger based on the Senate’s rejection of his bill to dissolve the clean energy finance corporation, was a smart move. The CEFC, Australia’s ""green bank"", is the most popular part of the former government’s response to climate change and should be defended. It doesn't appear that the government will take Milne up on her offer. Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, yesterday said ""just because you're given a trigger, it doesn't mean you have to pull it.""  There's also disquiet in the government's own ranks about the CEFC itself. Members of the Abbott government speak out against the CEFC in public. Privately, some are accepting of its role alongside their own ""direct action"" policy. Others raise the question: given its commercial orientation, why couldn’t the role the CEFC plays be taken up by the private sector? The reality is that traditional providers of debt financing have been very slow to understand clean energy technology investments. The skills required to adequately assess the viability of energy efficiency and clean energy loan applications simply aren’t widely available in the private market in Australia. That’s why the CEFC was set up. Without it, job-creating projects to the value of $2.5bn may never have got off the ground.  The CEFC currently works alongside carbon pricing and the renewable energy target to successfully drive down emissions in Australia. The real question is this: if Abbott doesn't move on the CEFC to prompt a double dissolution, what climate action will remain after 1 July, when the new senate sits? If Clive Palmer decides to cave in to Tony Abbott and his senators vote down the carbon price, he’ll likely be joined by the Motoring Enthusiasts' party senator-elect, Ricky Muir. This would make Australia the first country in the world to go backwards on an emissions trading scheme, out of over 40 countries who have them.  The senate’s attention will then turn to Abbott’s so-called “direct action” plan. Unless major shifts occur over the next few weeks, the government is unlikely to have the numbers to pass its legislation to establish the emissions reduction fund at the core of direct action. Without strong penalty provisions for polluters who don’t deliver the cuts in carbon pollution they pledge, the government will struggle to get the support of senator Nick Xenophon. But with strong penalty provisions, Clive Palmer will likely block it.  In light of this potential policy vacuum on carbon pollution – a possible scenario where Australia has neither a carbon price nor a “direct action” plan – the role of the CEFC becomes even more vital.  The CEFC needs 38 votes to survive the government’s attempts to abolish it. The Greens and the Labor party will make up 35 votes in the new senate, leaving three remaining from a combination of the Palmer United party, Xenophon, Muir and senator John Madigan. Xenophon yesterday voted in favour of keeping the CEFC act, and is very supportive of most projects funded by the CEFC, including solar thermal, solar PV and bioenergy projects. While he’d like to see caps on loans provided to wind power, this is best achieved via the investment mandate provided by the environment minister to the corporation, not by abandoning the fund altogether. To save the CEFC outright, this possibility may have to be entertained. Less clear is where Muir will fall on the CEFC question. It would be a mistake to assume, as some media outlets have done, that Muir will always vote with the Palmer United Party. The agreement between these two parties gives Muir the capacity to vote whichever way he wants. There’s no reason to assume that he is against investing in clean energy. Indeed, early signs are positive. Yesterday, one of the Motoring Enthusiasts' key party players, Keith Littler, was quoted as saying that the CEFC “appears to be a good thing”. As the registered officer of the party, Littler is in a position to put himself in the senate, should Muir decide that it’s all too hard. Other key influencers in the party also support the CEFC, so it may end up gaining the senator-elect's support. Should Muir vote with Xenophon to save the fund, the green bank’s future could be determined by Madigan, the unlikely senator from the Democratic Labor party. In December last year, Madigan told Fairfax media that he does “not support the abolition of the clean energy finance corporation” and yesterday abstained on the vote in the senate – hopeful signs. Whether Madigan eventually votes in favour of the CEFC will likely depend on whether he becomes aware of the value the fund provides to Australia’s ailing manufacturing sector, especially the opportunities to help manufacturers reduce costs through loans targeting energy efficiency, which are estimated to be worth $2.4 billion in 2020. Given the way the CEFC has already started helping manufacturers tap into these savings, it’s possible Madigan can be convinced of its value. Palmer's senators' votes could also be crucial, depending on how Muir, Xenophon and Madigan vote. So far, Palmer has said little on the issue, apart from expressing support for ""voluntary"" renewable energy measures (as opposed to ""mandatory"" ones like the carbon price). The CEFC is one of the largest ""voluntary"" renewable energy schemes in the country, so, going on Palmer’s previous logic, he may well end up voting to keep it.  With the Senate looking likely to repeal the price on carbon pollution and dismantle the bodies set up to administer it, while blocking Tony Abbott’s plan to pay polluters who promise to pollute less, the CEFC may be the last remaining legacy of the previous government's attempts to tackle climate change."

"The UK's climate change policies have not damaged business competitiveness, leading economists will say today. A new report by Samuela Bassi and Dimitri Zenghelis of the Grantham Research Institute will argue that climate change policies have not hampered the performance of the UK's economy, and that these same policies can increase the competitiveness of the UK in the long term by encouraging greater innovation and efficiency.  The authors examined a range of studies suggesting that climate change policies could lead to some companies leaving the UK in favour of countries with less stringent emissions-reduction policies.  But it found recent papers documenting the actual impact of climate policies show that carbon prices have not been high enough to prompt ""any detectable"" re-location of carbon-intensive firms. As such, the papers challenge warnings that climate policies are leading to so-called ""carbon leakage"", whereby carbon-intensive firms respond to emissions-reduction initiatives by migrating overseas. As a result, the new study says there is no reason to weaken the scale of ambition in the UK's fourth carbon budget, which sets out emissions reduction targets for the period from 2023 to 2027. The fourth carbon budget was agreed by Parliament in June 2011, following the recommendation of the expert independent Committee on Climate Change (CCC) that it should require UK annual emissions to be 50% lower in 2025 compared with 1990. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change announced in December 2012 that the government would review the fourth carbon budget in early 2014 and would revise it upwards if it found that ""our domestic commitments place us on a different emissions trajectory than the EU ETS trajectory agreed by the EU"". Some politicians have argued that this is indeed the case and want the fourth carbon budget to be altered, even though leading businesses have called for it to be confirmed as soon as possible and the CCC has repeatedly argued there is no case for watering down the current targets. Any weakening of the budget is similarly rejected in the new report, although it concedes that as carbon prices rise in the future the government may need to offer temporary help to large energy users to prevent carbon leakage becoming a problem. ""Arguments in favour of revising the fourth carbon budget, based on concerns about competitiveness, do not appear to be supported by the evidence,"" the report states. ""Existing data suggests that the impact of current policies is small or negligible, dwarfed by a range of other economic factors."" The report also finds there are real opportunities to improve UK competitiveness through carbon-reduction policies.  ""Well-designed climate change policies could offer business opportunities in fast-growing global markets, as countries, such as the United States, China and Member States of the European Union, implement ever more stringent carbon reduction and energy efficiency policies,"" it says. ""The UK is well-positioned to benefit from a global transition to a more resource-efficient and renewable economy, provided flexible structural policies allow it to use its comparative advantages."""
"The US supreme court largely upheld Barack Obama's plans to cut carbon pollution from power plants on Monday, delivering critical support for his climate action plan. The court reaffirmed the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, which is the pillar of Obama's climate plan.  The court did rule 5-4 to trim the scope of those rules, but the justices said the overall result was weighted in favour of the EPA. “EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case,” Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his opinion. “It sought to regulate sources it said were responsible for 86% of all the greenhouse gases emitted from stationary sources nationwide. Under our holdings, EPA will be able to regulate sources responsible for 83% of those emissions.” The decision was the third time the supreme court has reaffirmed the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions – and the justices have indicated they will not entertain further challenges to that broad question. That reduces the prospects for success of the anticipated flurry of legal challenges to the EPA's new power plant rules from industry, conservative groups, and the attorney generals of Republican states. The EPA as well as environmental groups described the decision as a big win. “Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations,” the EPA said in a statement. “The supreme court’s decision is a win for our efforts to reduce carbon pollution because it allows EPA, states and other permitting authorities to continue to require carbon pollution limits in permits for the largest pollution sources.” However Richard Faulk, of the law and economics centre of George Mason University, argued the supreme court decision represented “a stinging and devastating rebuke to EPA's grand design of regulating the entire economy”. At issue on Monday was whether new industrial facilities – oil refineries, factories and the power plants covered by Obama's climate plan – could be compelled to limit their carbon dioxide emissions. The court ruled that facilities that were already required to obtain permits for other air pollutants could also be compelled to limit greenhouse emissions. The justices agreed with the EPA's rationale that it was regulating those industries for greenhouse gas emissions just as it did with earlier rules for cars. But the court said the EPA rules for industry as originally written were too sweeping and could corral churches and schools which are not already covered under existing air quality laws. Instead, Scalia said the new rules should be limited to the biggest sources of carbon dioxide emissions such as power plants, industrial facilities and refineries. ""To permit the extra 3%, however, we would have to recognise a power in EPA and other government agencies to revise clear statutory terms,"" he said. Campaign groups saw the decision as a big win for Obama's climate plan, because it once again endorsed the EPA's authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. In a conference call with reporters, the Environmental Defense Fund also suggested that the original rule would have been too cumbersome for the EPA to administer. More importantly, they said Monday's decision would make it easier for the EPA to withstand future challenges from industry and conservative groups as it puts Obama's climate plan into force."
"A drive through the sticky Florida heat into Alton Road in Miami Beach can be an unexpectedly awkward business. Most of the boulevard, which runs north through the heart of the resort's most opulent palm-fringed real estate, has been reduced to a single lane that is hemmed in by bollards, road-closed signs, diggers, trucks, workmen, stacks of giant concrete cylinders and mounds of grey, foul-smelling earth. It is an unedifying experience but an illuminating one – for this once glamorous thoroughfare, a few blocks from Miami Beach's art deco waterfront and its white beaches, has taken on an unexpected role. It now lies on the front line of America's battle against climate change and the rise in sea levels that it has triggered.  ""Climate change is no longer viewed as a future threat round here,"" says atmosphere expert Professor Ben Kirtman, of the University of Miami. ""It is something that we are having to deal with today."" Every year, with the coming of high spring and autumn tides, the sea surges up the Florida coast and hits the west side of Miami Beach, which lies on a long, thin island that runs north and south across the water from the city of Miami. The problem is particularly severe in autumn when winds often reach hurricane levels. Tidal surges are turned into walls of seawater that batter Miami Beach's west coast and sweep into the resort's storm drains, reversing the flow of water that normally comes down from the streets above. Instead seawater floods up into the gutters of Alton Road, the first main thoroughfare on the western side of Miami Beach, and pours into the street. Then the water surges across the rest of the island. The effect is calamitous. Shops and houses are inundated; city life is paralysed; cars are ruined by the corrosive seawater that immerses them. During one recent high spring tide, laundromat owner Eliseo Toussaint watched as slimy green saltwater bubbled up from the gutters. It rapidly filled the street and then blocked his front door. ""This never used to happen,"" Toussaint told the New York Times. ""I've owned this place eight years and now it's all the time."" Today, shop owners keep plastic bags and rubber bands handy to wrap around their feet when they have to get to their cars through rising waters, while householders have found that ground-floor spaces in garages are no longer safe to keep their cars. Only those on higher floors can hope to protect their cars from surging sea waters that corrode and rot the innards of their vehicles. Hence the construction work at Alton Road, where $400m is now being spent in an attempt to halt these devastating floods – by improving Miami Beach's stricken system of drains and sewers. In total, around $1.5bn is to be invested in projects aimed at holding back the rising waters. Few scientists believe the works will have a long-term effect. ""There has been a rise of about 10 inches in sea levels since the 19th century – brought about by humanity's heating of the planet through its industrial practices – and that is now bringing chaos to Miami Beach by regularly flooding places like Alton Road,"" says Harold Wanless, a geology professor at the University of Miami. ""And it is going to get worse. By the end of this century we could easily have a rise of six feet, possibly 10 feet. Nothing much will survive that. Most of the land here is less than 10 feet above sea level."" What makes Miami exceptionally vulnerable to climate change is its unique geology. The city – and its satellite towns and resorts – is built on a dome of porous limestone which is soaking up the rising seawater, slowly filling up the city's foundations and then bubbling up through drains and pipes. Sewage is being forced upwards and fresh water polluted. Miami's low topography only adds to these problems. There is little land out here that rises more than six feet above sea level. Many condos and apartment blocks open straight on the edge of the sea. Of the total of 4.2 million US citizens who live at an elevation of four feet or less, 2.4 million of them live in south Florida. At Florida International University, geologist Peter Harlem has created a series of maps that chart what will happen as the sea continues to rise. These show that by the time oceans have risen by four feet – a fairly conservative forecast – most of Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Virginia Key and all the area's other pieces of prime real estate, will be bathtubs. At six feet, Miami city's waterfront and the Florida Keys will have disappeared. The world's busiest cruise ship port, which handles four million passengers, will disappear beneath the waves. ""This is the fact of life about the ocean: it is very, very powerful,"" says Harlem. Miami and its surroundings are facing a calamity worthy of the Old Testament. It is an astonishing story. Despite its vast wealth, the city might soon be consumed by the waves, for even if all emissions of carbon dioxide were halted tomorrow – a very unlikely event given their consistent rise over the decades – there is probably enough of the gas in the atmosphere to continue to warm our planet, heat and expand our seas, and melt polar ice. In short, there seems there is nothing that can stop the waters washing over Miami completely. It a devastating scenario. But what really surprises visitors and observers is the city's response, or to be more accurate, its almost total lack of reaction. The local population is steadily increasing; land prices continue to surge; and building is progressing at a generous pace. During my visit last month, signs of construction – new shopping malls, cranes towering over new condominiums and scaffolding enclosing freshly built apartment blocks – could be seen across the city, its backers apparently oblivious of scientists' warnings that the foundations of their buildings may be awash very soon. Not that they are alone. Most of Florida's senior politicians – in particular, Senator Marco Rubio, former governor Jeb Bush and current governor Rick Scott, all Republican climate-change deniers – have refused to act or respond to warnings of people like Wanless or Harlem or to give media interviews to explain their stance, though Rubio, a Republican party star and a possible 2016 presidential contender, has made his views clear in speeches. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it. I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy,"" he said recently. Miami is in denial in every sense, it would seem. Or as Wanless puts it: ""People are simply sticking their heads in the sand. It is mind-boggling."" Not surprisingly, Rubio's insistence that his state is no danger from climate change has brought him into conflict with local people. Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami, has a particularly succinct view of the man and his stance. ""Rubio is an idiot,"" says Stoddard. ""He says he is not a scientist so he doesn't have a view about climate change and sea-level rise and so won't do anything about it. Yet Florida's other senator, Democrat Bill Nelson, is holding field hearings where scientists can tell people what the data means. Unfortunately, not enough people follow his example. And all the time, the waters are rising."" Philip Stoddard is particularly well-placed to judge what is happening to Miami. Tall, thin, with a dry sense of humour, he is a politician, having won two successive elections to be mayor of South Miami, and a scientist, a biology professor at Florida International University. The backyard of the home that he shares with his architect wife, Grey Reid, reflects his passion for the living world. While most other South Miami residences sport bright blue swimming pools and barbecues, Stoddard has created a small lake, fringed with palms and ferns, that would do justice to the swampy Everglades near his home. Bass, koi and mosquito fish swim here, while bright dragonflies and zebra lapwing butterflies flit overhead. It is a naturalists' haven but Stoddard is under no illusions about the risks facing his home. Although several miles inland, the house is certainly not immune to the changes that threaten to engulf south Florida. ""The thing about Miami is that when it goes, it will all be gone,"" says Stoddard. ""I used to work at Cornell University and every morning, when I went to work, I climbed more elevation than exists in the entire state of Florida. Our living-room floor here in south Miami is at an elevation of 10 feet above sea level at present. There are significant parts of south Florida that are less than six feet above sea level and which are now under serious threat of inundation."" Nor will south Florida have to wait that long for the devastation to come. Long before the seas have risen a further three or four feet, there will be irreversible breakdowns in society, he says. ""Another foot of sea-level rise will be enough to bring salt water into our fresh water supplies and our sewage system. Those services will be lost when that happens,"" says Stoddard. ""You won't be able to flush away your sewage and taps will no longer provide homes with fresh water. Then you will find you will no longer be able to get flood insurance for your home. Land and property values will plummet and people will start to leave. Places like South Miami will no longer be able to raise enough taxes to run our neighbourhoods. Where will we find the money to fund police to protect us or fire services to tackle house fires? Will there even be enough water pressure for their fire hoses? It takes us into all sorts of post-apocalyptic scenarios. And that is only with a one-foot sea-level rise. It makes one thing clear though: mayhem is coming."" And then there is the issue of Turkey Point nuclear plant, which lies 24 miles south of Miami. Its operators insist it can survive sea surges and hurricanes and point out that its reactor vessel has been built 20 feet above sea level. But critics who include Stoddard, Harlem and others argue that anciliary equipment – including emergency diesel generators that are crucial to keeping cooling waters circulating in the event of power failure – are not so well protected. In the event of sea rise and a major storm surge, a power supply disruption could cause a repeat of the Fukushima accident of 2011, they claim. In addition, inundation maps like those prepared by Harlem show that with a three-foot sea-level rise, Turkey Point will be cut off from the mainland and will become accessible only by boat or aircraft. And the higher the seas go, the deeper it will be submerged. Turkey Point was built in the 1970s when sea level rises were not an issue, of course. But for scientists like Ben Kirtman, they are now a fact of life. The problem is that many planners and managers still do not take the threat into account when planning for the future, he argues. A classic example is provided by the state's water management. South Florida, because it is so low-lying, is criss-crossed with canals that take away water when there is heavy rainfall and let it pour into the sea. ""But if you have sea level rises of much more than a foot in the near future, when you raise the canal gates to let the rain water out, you will find sea water rushing in instead,"" Kirtman said. ""The answer is to install massive pumps as they have done in New Orleans. Admittedly, these are expensive. They each cost millions of dollars. But we are going to need them and if we don't act now we are going to get caught out. The trouble is that no one is thinking about climate change or sea-level rises at a senior management level."" The problem stems from the top, Kirtman said, from the absolute insistence of influential climate change deniers that global warming is not happening. ""When statesmen like Rubio say things like that, they make it very, very hard for anything to get done on a local level – for instance for Miami to raise the millions it needs to build new sewers and canals. If local people have been told by their leaders that global warming is not happening, they will simply assume you are wasting their money by building defences against it. ""But global warming is occurring. That is absolutely unequivocal. Since the 1950s, the climate system has warmed. That is an absolute fact. And we are now 95% sure that that warming is due to human activities. If I was 95% sure that my house was on fire, would I get out? Obviously I would. It is straightforward."" This point is backed by Harold Wanless. ""Every day we continue to pump uncontrolled amounts of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, we strengthen the monster that is going to consume us. We are heating up the atmosphere and then we are heating up the oceans so that they expand and rise. There doesn't look as if anything is going to stop that. People are starting to plan in Miami but really they just don't see where it is all going."" Thus one of the great cities of the world faces obliteration in the coming decades. ""It is over for south Florida. It is as simple as that. Nor is it on its own,"" Wanless admits. ""The next two or three feet of sea-level rise that we get will do away with just about every barrier island we have across the planet. Then, when rises get to four-to-six feet, all the world's great river deltas will disappear and with them the great stretches of agricultural land that surrounds them. People still have their heads in the sand about this but it is coming. Miami is just the start. It is worth watching just for that reason alone. It is a major US city and it is going to let itself drown."""
"The people of Kiribati, a group of islands in the Pacific ocean particularly exposed to climate change, now own a possible refuge elsewhere. President Anote Tong has recently finalised the purchase of 20 sq km on Vanua Levu, one of the Fiji islands, about 2,000km away. The Church of England has sold a stretch of land mainly covered by dense forest for $8.77m. ""We would hope not to put everyone on [this] one piece of land, but if it became absolutely necessary, yes, we could do it,"" Tong told the Associated Press. Kiribati has a population of about 110,000 scattered over 33 small, low-lying islands extending over a total area of 3.5m sq km.  In 2009 the Maldives were the first to raise the possibility of purchasing land in another country in anticipation of being gradually submerged. At the time the government looked at options in India and Sri Lanka. Now Kiribati has taken action. ""Kiribati is just the first on a list which could get longer as time passes,"" says Ronald Jumeau, Seychelles ambassador at the United Nations, who took part in the international negotiations on climate change in Bonn last month. In March the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the volume on adaptation of its fifth assessment report, confirming in starker terms forecasts first outlined by scientists in 1990. Within a few decades, small islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans risk being extensively or even completely submerged. In places the sea level is rising by 1.2cm a year, four times faster than the global average. The cost of protecting these places against rising sea levels, compared with national income, is among the highest in the world. Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Maldives are among the 10 countries where the financial impact of climate change is the most severe. For many of these countries, which are represented by the Alliance of Small Island States, the impacts of climate change are ""irreparable"", as Tong has often stressed. ""Whatever is agreed within the United States today, with China [the two largest sources of CO2 emissions], it will not have a bearing on our future, because already, it's too late for us ... And so we are the canary. But hopefully, that experience will send a very strong message that we might be on the frontline today, but others will be on the frontline next,"" he said in an interview on CNN last month. This explains why small island states think it is so important to set up an international mechanism for loss and damage, to compensate for the irremediable consequences of global warming. The international community approved the principle of such a mechanism in November 2013. ""When a population is forced to leave its country, it is no longer a matter of adaptation,"" Jumeau claims. ""Where will these countries find funds? It is up to the industrialised countries, which caused global warming, to shoulder their responsibilities."" He wants to make the loss and damage mechanism a priority for the global deal on climate change slated to be signed in Paris in December 2015. In the immediate future, the land purchased by Kiribati will above all be used to for agricultural and fish-farming projects to guarantee the nation's food security. With sea water increasingly contaminating the atolls' groundwater and catastrophic coral bleaching – total in some cases such as Phoenix atoll – there are growing food shortages. ""Among the small islands, Kiribati is the country that has done most to anticipate its population's future needs,"" says François Gemenne, a specialist on migrations at Versailles-Saint Quentin University, France. ""The government has launched the 'migration with dignity' policy to allow people to apply for jobs on offer in neighbouring countries such as New Zealand. The aim is to avoid one day having to cope with a humanitarian evacuation."" Kiribati has long-standing relations with Fiji. In the 1950s families from Banaba island, who had been displaced to make room for a phosphate mine, took refuge there, Gemenne recalls. According to the IPCC there is as yet no proof that climate change is the only cause of migration from small Pacific islands. But in the most vulnerable places, islanders have few options. The government of the Marshall islands has decided to follow Kiribati's example. Others, such as Tuvalu, refuse to entertain the idea of leaving their land. In either case, the radical decision by President Tong highlights their dilemma. This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"
"Clive Palmer is insisting power companies prove they have reduced electricity prices by the full amount of the carbon tax in a legislative amendment the Palmer United party senators will insist upon before they will vote to repeal the tax. Palmer had his first meeting with the prime minister, Tony Abbott, on Thursday morning after his dramatic announcement alongside the former US vice-president Al Gore on Wednesday. The PUP leader is beginning to provide some details of the only condition he has put on his party’s support for the carbon tax repeal: that there be tougher legal requirements to ensure the repeal flows through to household bills. “The Palmer United party amendments will provide an enforcement mechanism to ensure the generators and then the retailers are required by law to pass on the full benchmarked electricity and gas price falls associated with the carbon tax repeal,” Palmer said in a statement. “This would go beyond government provisions which only give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission enhanced monitoring arrangements.”  Industry groups were scrambling to try to understand what Palmer meant by the condition on Thursday, but Guardian Australia understands it will involve reversing the onus of proof – in some way requiring companies to show and certify that they have taken the full carbon price out, rather than just relying on the ACCC to monitor prices.  Sources say Palmer wants to hold Abbott to a promise he made last year. “When this bill is passed, this government estimates that power prices will go down by 9%, gas prices will go down by 7%, and that means that the average power bill will be $200 a year lower and the average gas bill will be $70 a year lower,” Abbott said on 15 October. But exactly how Palmer’s idea would work is unclear given that prices are set by state regulators in all states but Victoria and South Australia, and the carbon price increase averaged 9% but varied between states depending on how they generate power. Furthermore, big industry usually gets power through long-term contracted arrangements with generators. The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, has said he believes he has all the powers he needs to make sure the repeal is passed through to lower household bills. Emerging from his first meeting with Abbott since the pair had a very public altercation at a Liberal party federal council meeting two years ago, Palmer said the prime minister had been “very receptive”. “To be fair to the PM, our agenda we announced yesterday was a surprise to him, but with any good idea, he's taken time to get some advice and that's what you would expect him to do,” Palmer said. He thought Abbott would be able to agree on the power price amendment. “He can legislate anything, he has a will to do that,” Palmer said. “It takes a few days to draft up provisions. “If energy generators are going to save a lot of money they should pass that on to their customers. We will put our amendments and see whether the government accepts them. Sincerity is always subject to proof, so we want to see them passed to see electricity prices brought down,” Palmer said. Abbott’s spokeswoman also said the meeting had been “genial” and the government was confident it would be able to achieve the carbon tax repeal. Palmer is continuing to insist he will seek to establish an emissions trading scheme, with the price set at zero until China, the US, the European Union, Japan and South Korea also have such schemes. But the government would almost certainly reject any new ETS legislation in the lower house. Palmer claimed he wanted to “change the world” and said he would attend the UN conference in Paris next year where it is hoped a global agreement can be reached for emissions reduction targets to take effect after 2020. Palmer said his senators would oppose the abolition of the $10bn Clean Energy Finance Corporation and oppose any changes to the renewable energy target until at least 2016. But he will also oppose the Direct Action plan, meaning the government will be left without a clear mechanism to achieve Australia’s international pledge to reduce domestic emissions by 5% by 2020. The House of Representatives continued to debate the carbon tax repeal on Thursday, in preparation for it to be put before the new Senate almost as soon as it sits for the first time on 7 July."
"The government appears to be conceding it will be forced to retain the $10bn Clean Energy Finance Corporation, removing the abolition of the “green bank” from the other carbon tax repeal bills that were passed by the lower house for a third time on Thursday night. At his Wednesday press conference with former US vice president Al Gore, Palmer United party leader Clive Palmer declared his three senators would vote against the CEFC repeal. It is also opposed by crossbench senators Nick Xenophon and John Madigan and possibly also Motoring Enthusiast Ricky Muir.  But the Coalition was celebrating last night as the carbon tax repeal passed the lower house, believing it can easily meet Palmer’s single condition to finally achieve its passage through the Senate. Clive Palmer is insisting power companies prove they have reduced electricity prices by the full amount of the carbon tax in a legislative amendment the Palmer United party senators will insist upon before they will vote to repeal the tax. The government used question time to indicate it could easily meet the demands. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who had a first meeting with Palmer on Thursday morning, said he looked forward to working with the PUP leader “to ensure all the savings from the abolition of the carbon tax are passed on to consumers”. Asked about the demand, environment minister Greg Hunt said “we are happy to enshrine in legislation guarantees over and above what we already have”. Following his dramatic announcement alongside Gore, Palmer began on Thursday to provide some details of the sole condition he said he would put on his party’s support for the carbon tax repeal. “The Palmer United party amendments will provide an enforcement mechanism to ensure the generators and then the retailers are required by law to pass on the full benchmarked electricity and gas price falls associated with the carbon tax repeal,” Palmer said in a statement. “This would go beyond government provisions which only give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission enhanced monitoring arrangements.” There was initial uncertainty among industry groups about what Palmer meant by the condition, but Guardian Australia understands it will involve reversing the onus of proof – in some way requiring companies to show and certify that they have taken the full carbon price out, rather than just relying on the ACCC to monitor prices.

"When American geologist Ulyana Horodyskyj set up a mini weather station at 5,800m on Mount Himlung, on the Nepal-Tibet border, she looked east towards Everest and was shocked. The world's highest glacier, Khumbu, was turning visibly darker as particles of fine dust, blown by fierce winds, settled on the bright, fresh snow. ""One-week-old snow was turning black and brown before my eyes,"" she said. The problem was even worse on the nearby Ngozumpa glacier, which snakes down from Cho Oyu – the world's sixth highest mountain. There, Horodyskyj found that so much dust had been blown on to the surface that the ability of the ice to reflect sunlight, a process known as albedo, dropped 20% in a single month. The dust that was darkening the brilliant whiteness of the snow was heating up in the strong sun and melting the snow and ice, she said.  The phenomenon of ""dark snow"" is being recorded from the Himalayas to the Arctic as increasing amounts of dust from bare soil, soot from fires and ultra-fine particles of ""black carbon"" from industry and diesel engines are being whipped up and deposited sometimes thousands of miles away. The result, say scientists, is a significant dimming of the brightness of the world's snow and icefields, leading to a longer melt season, which in turn creates feedback where more solar heat is absorbed and the melting accelerates. In a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience, a team of French government meteorologists has reported that the Arctic ice cap, which is thought to have lost an average of 12.9bn tonnes of ice a year between 1992 and 2010 due to general warming, may be losing an extra 27bn tonnes a year just because of dust, potentially adding several centimetres of sea-level rise by 2100. Satellite measurements, say the authors, show that in the last 10 years the surface of Greenland's ice sheet has considerably darkened during the melt season, which in some areas is now between six and 11 days longer per decade than it was 40 years ago. As glaciers retreat and the snow cover disappears earlier in the year, so larger areas of bare soil are uncovered, which increases the dust erosion, scientists suggest. Research indicates that the Arctic's albedo may be declining much faster than was estimated only a few years ago. Earlier this year a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that declining Arctic albedo between 1979 and 2011 constituted 25% of the heating effect from carbon dioxide over the same time. According to Danish glaciologist Jason Box, who heads the Dark Snow project to measure the effect of dust and other darkening agents on Greenland's ice sheet, Arctic ice sheet reflectivity has been at a near record low for much of 2014. Even a minor decrease in the brightness of the ice sheet can double the average yearly rate of ice loss, seen from 1992 to 2010. ""Low reflectivity heats the snow more than normal. A dark snow cover will thus melt earlier and more intensely. A positive feedback exists for snow in which, once melting begins, the surface gets yet darker due to increased water content,"" says Box on his blog. Both human-created and natural air pollutants are darkening the ice, say other scientists. Nearly invisible particles of ""black carbon"" resulting from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels from diesel engines are being swept thousands of miles from industrial centres in the US, Europe and south-east Asia, as is dust from Africa and the Middle East, where dust storms are becoming bigger as the land dries out, with increasingly long and deep droughts. Earlier this year dust from the Sahara was swept north for several thousands miles, smothered Britain and reached Norway. According to Kaitlin Keegan, a researcher at Dartmouth College in the US state of New Hampshire, the record melting in 2012 of Greenland's northeastern ice-sheet was largely a result of forest fires in Siberia and the US. Any reduction in albedo is a disaster, says Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Oceans Physics Group at Cambridge University. He said: ""Replacing an ice-covered surface, where the albedo may be 70% in summer, by an open-water surface with albedo less than 10%, causes more radiation to be absorbed by the Earth, causing an acceleration of warming. ""I have calculated that the albedo change from the disappearance of the last of the summer ice in 2012 was the equivalent to the effect of all the extra carbon dioxide that we have added to the atmosphere in the last 25 years,"" he says. UlyanaHorodyskyj, who is planning to return to the Himalayas to continue monitoring dust pollution at altitude, said she had been surprised by how bad it was. ""This is mostly manmade pollution,"" she said. ""Governments must act, and people must become more aware of what is happening. It needs to be looked at properly."""
"The Australia Institute has defended its role in negotiating the Clive Palmer-Al Gore climate announcement because the concessions made by the Palmer United party had “avoided a big step backwards” and reset the climate debate in Australia. In an email to supporters, the thinktank’s strategic director and former Greens staffer, Ben Oquist, one of a number of people involved in bringing Gore and Palmer together, defended the move as a step forward, despite PUP’s unchanged resolve to repeal Australia’s carbon pricing scheme after the Senate resumes next week.  PUP will now use its balance of power votes in the Senate to retain the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Climate Change Authority and the renewable energy target. “Six months ago it seemed certain that the Abbott government would succeed in its plan to scrap the RET, the CEFC and the CCA,” Oquist wrote. “[The institute’s] research has long shown that the RET has been the key mechanism driving investment in clean energy production … It has had more impact than the carbon price at zero cost to the government. Billions of dollars in investment was being put at risk by the Abbott government’s determination to unwind the scheme. “The Palmer-Gore announcement has reset climate policy and politics. Keeping the CCA, the RET and the CEFC is much more than most expected from PUP. We have avoided a big step backwards … [it] also reframed the debate about carbon pricing – it's hard to suggest carbon pricing is some form of left-wing, economy-wrecking conspiracy when a billionaire mining magnate supports it.” Oquist says it “would have been preferable for PUP to have delayed a vote on the carbon price repeal by sending it to a committee. It would have been preferable for them to amend the existing carbon price to move straight to the floating price [due to start next July]. The fact is that the PUP senators and Clive Palmer think that their voters expect them to vote it down, and that's what they intend to do.” Government backbenchers have been pushing for the RET to be watered down (it currently requires 41,000 gigawatt hours of power to be sourced from renewables by 2020) on the grounds that it pushes up power prices. Before the PUP announcement senior government sources were suggesting the scheme could be closed to new entrants after the government’s own review of the scheme, chaired by the businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton. More recently backbenchers have been pushing for a less drastic scaling back. ACIL Allen modelling done for the government’s review shows the current target will increase the average household bill by an average of $54 a year between now and 2020, but will reduce bills by a similar annual amount over the following decade compared with what they would be if the RET were repealed. The modelling used assumptions highly unfavourable to renewable energy, including that coal and gas prices would remain almost unchanged until 2040. Separate modelling for the Clean Energy Council by Roam Consulting – with different assumptions about gas prices – found that bills would be $50 higher by 2020 if the RET were repealed, compared with it being retained. And polling has revealed that Australians overwhelmingly want the renewable energy target to be retained or even increased. The polling, done for the Climate Institute, shows 72% of Australians want to keep or expand the RET. The Coalition went to the election promising to keep the RET, which underpins investment in energy sources such as wind and solar, but said it would review the fact that the policy was exceeding its original goal of delivering 20% renewable energy by 2020 because of falling electricity demand. Warburton, a veteran industrialist and the chairman of the Westfield Retail Trust, described his views on climate science in a 2011 interview on ABC. “Well, I am a sceptic,” he said. “I’ve never moved away from that. I’ve always believed sceptical. But a sceptic is a different person than a denier. I say the science is not settled. I’m not saying it’s wrong. I’ve never said it’s wrong, but I don’t believe it’s settled.”"
"It means raccoon cat. The name was submitted by the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to the World Meteorological Organization, which oversees the list of storm names in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific.  Typhoon Neoguri has already hit outlying southern islands of Japan. It passed through the southern Okinawa Island Chains on Tuesday, with sustained wind speeds of 108 miles per hour (175 km/h) and gusts of up to 154 mph, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Most buildings in Japan are designed to withstand typhoons. Even so, in Okinawa, Neoguri has already claimed two lives. A further 25 have been reported injured, with over 500,000 forced to seek shelter. Around 70,000 homes have been left without power, according to the news agency AFP. Buildings and trees have been brought down, with air and sea traffic brought to a standstill. More destruction is set to follow as the storm bears down on mainland Japan. The country's weather agency has warned that as much as 300 millimetres (12 inches) of rain will have fallen on Kyushu in just 24 hours by noon on Thursday. A typhoon is a type of large tropical storm or cyclone that has a circular or spiral system of violent winds, typically hundreds of kilometres across. The winds spiral around a region of low atmospheric pressure known as the ""eye"". Both typhoons and hurricanes are powerful tropical cyclones, - storms with very high sustained wind speeds. The only difference between them is their location: typhoons are formed in the western Pacific Ocean, while hurricanes form in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific Ocean. This depends on the wind speed of the storm. A typhoon is any cyclone with a sustained wind speed greater than 74 km/h. Lower wind speeds are classed as topical storms. The Japan Meteorological Agency unofficially divides typhoons into the following categories: • A typhoon has wind speeds of 119 km/h to 156 km/h • A strong typhoon has wind speeds of 157 km/h to 193 km/h • A violent typhoon has wind speeds of 194 km/h to 239 km/h • A super typhoon has wind speeds greater than 240 km/h Initially classed as a super-typhoon, Neoguri has been downgraded to a strong typhoon. As such it can devastate any region it hits directly or indirectly, flattening buildings and forming high waves off coastlines. Typhoon Neoguri is moving towards mainland Japan. The combination of high pressure to the northeast and a trough of low pressure to the northwest will steer Neoguri in a curve that will take it over or near much of Japan. As Neoguri passes over colder water south of the mainland, the storm will weaken, but will still impact the southern island of Kyushu with gusts of up to 110 mph (180 km/h), the national weather agency said. Nagasaki may also be severely hit, after which Neoguri should retain minimal typhoon strength (winds of 74 mph) into central Japan and is expected to reach the Tokyo area by Friday. It's very difficult to predict when the storm will dissipate. There are a great many factors that will contribute to its longevity and strength, such as surface sea temperature and when it hits land. Most likely, it will be much weakened by the time it has passed over Japan and turn into a large tropical storm. Yes and yes. Last year there were 30 typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean region. Neoguri is only the ninth this year, making it probable that there will be many more to come in the next few months. Typically about seven or eight pass over Okinawa Prefecture each year, and about three hit the Japanese main islands. Most typhoons dissipate over the Pacific Ocean, causing little disruption. Japan is no stranger to typhoons, but Neoguri is proving to be a stronger storm than it has experienced in recent years. The Japanese weather agency said Neoguri could be one of the strongest to approach Japan in decades, and issued its highest warnings for violent winds, high waves and heavy rain. However, the wind speeds are not as severe as those experienced by the US under Hurricane Katrina, which hit land with wind speeds of 200 km/h. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN body that recently reviewed scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change, concluded: ""Tropical cyclone frequency is likely to decrease or remain unchanged over the 21st century, while intensity (ie maximum wind speed and rainfall rates) is likely to increase."" However, the IPCC said it was harder to make region-specific projections. Extreme cyclones in Asia since 1970 have claimed more than half a million lives. "
"Clive Palmer's shock announcement on Wednesday night next to former vice president Al Gore has been very cautiously welcomed by Australia's environment movement. Palmer's announcement effectively leaves Abbott completely isolated on climate policy, both domestically, and as Al Gore's presence demonstrates, internationally as well. It is remarkable that one of Australia's largest coal barons has firmly declared his support for renewables, taking action on global warming, and introducing an emissions trading scheme.  Senior leaders of some of the largest environment groups told me that they welcome Palmer's position on the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Climate Change Authority, while approaching the details with caution and a large grain of salt. It was labelled as ""definitely surprising"", ""very smart politically"", ""surprising"" and ""courageous"". There are no details behind Palmer's announcement, and it is unclear what approach he will take with his decision to support the abolition of the carbon ""tax"" and its replacement with an emissions trading scheme. Palmer also stated that he would not support prime minister Abbott's ""direct action"" policy, criticising it as a waste of money. Kelly O'Shanassy, the new CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who is organising the Climate Reality project that Gore is in Australia for, said ""keeping the 'clean three' of the RET, the CEFC, and the CCA is great news for all Australians. It's great to see that Clive Palmer has the courage to listen to the voices of Australians when they say they support clean energy and they support cutting pollution."" Several recent polls showed that a large majority of 72 percent of Australians support keeping or expanding the renewable energy target. Similarly, the polls show that Australians support putting a price on carbon, and just 22 percent support the discredited ""direct action"" policy. The Clean Energy Council was effusive in its congratulations. Deputy Chief Executive Kane Thornton described the announcement as ""a Titanic boost for the clean energy industry"". Increasing the proportion of Australia's energy from renewable sources would mean lower costs for consumers and potentially thousands of extra jobs. Kane said in a statement, ""what we need is policy stability to unlock these benefits, and the best outcome for the industry is if the policy is left alone to continue working."" A senior environment campaigner noted to me that ""we are approaching Palmer's announcement with caution, especially on the RET. This is not the first time the Palmer United Party has made an announcement about renewables, only to see it reversed less than 24 hours later."" What is clear is that Tony Abbott's offensive against renewable energy and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation are effectively dead. CEO of Environment Victoria, Mark Wakeham said to me, ""Palmer's announcement is definitely surprising, but is a pretty productive intervention that will change climate politics in Australia. The government should now give up on its attack on the RET and the CEFC immediately.""  Ben Pearson, the head of campaigning for Greenpeace Australia-Pacific agreed, saying to me: ""if this position holds, Palmer has turned climate politics on its axis."" The most ambiguous part of Palmer's announcement related to his position on the carbon price. He has said he wants to abolish the carbon tax and replace it with an emissions trading scheme. The catch is that he doesn't want the ETS to kick in until our major trading partners have one. I spoke to someone intimately involved in creating the architecture of the carbon price under Labor and asked them whether what Palmer was proposing was even possible. If Palmer votes to keep the architecture of the carbon price, by simply amending the existing legislation to set the price to zero dollars, and delays the automatic linkage of the carbon price to Europe's scheme, then it would be relatively simple to re-start Australia's emissions trading scheme in the future. ACF's O'Shanassy said, ""what the Palmer United Party has proposed around the carbon price is basically like taking the battery out of your car. The car still runs fine, and a smart person can always come along, replace the battery, and be off to the races."" However, I'm told it would become a ""nightmare"" if the entire carbon pricing framework was torn up and rewritten from scratch. National campaign director for the Wilderness Society, Lyndon Schneiders, told me that ""it's fantastic that Palmer is supporting an ETS and retaining the renewable energy target. It would be great to now see him to renounce his Galilee coal projects."" The CEO of The Climate Institute, John Connor, however, described the potential repeal of the carbon price as ""ugly"" and said it was unclear ""whether the Palmer United Party's call for an emissions trading scheme is a pre-condition for repeal of the carbon price and exactly what is intended. The devil is in the detail."" This concern was held by several other eNGO leaders, who told me that they fear Palmer is more interested in creating a political bargaining chip, rather than having any real commitment to climate action. The cautious welcome to Palmer's announcement extended beyond the environment movement. I also spoke to several union leaders, and the opposition Labor party. Colin Long, the Victorian secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union, a union that has been a strong advocate for climate action, told me that ""Palmer's acknowledgement of the importance of dealing with climate change is significant, and the idea of an ETS is an improvement on Abbott's useless ""direct action"" corporate subsidy policy. Palmer's commitment to the renewable energy target and the CEFC is a great relief and will hopefully thwart the Coalition's attempt to destroy the renewable energy industry."" Long-standing carbon price supporter and national president of the union representing coal miners, Tony Maher of the CFMEU, told me, ""our concern about abolishing the ETS was that it would mean we had to renegotiate all the consumer and job protections all over again in the future. It's not clear whether PUP is proposing to leave all those protections in place or not. We will be urging them to do so."" Federal Labor also welcomed Palmer's support for an emissions trading scheme. An opposition spokesman said, ""Labor's position on climate change has not changed. We will not support the repeal of the carbon tax unless there is a credible alternative that will deliver meaningful action to tackle climate change."" It is clear that Palmer (and Gore) has completely rewritten climate politics in Australia. Why he has done this is not clear, and there are elements of incomprehensibility in what has said. However, as a political tactic, it could potentially be a master stroke, and consigns Abbott's almost non-existent climate policy to the dust bin. As Greenpeace's Pearson quipped, ""tonight Al Gore has delivered Tony Abbott an inconvenient senate."""

"Global warming myths can never be permanently killed. Once debunked, a climate myth will go into a state of hibernation, waiting for enough time to pass that people forget the last time a scientific stake was thrust through its heart. The myth will eventually rise from the grave once again, seeking out victims with tasty, underutilized brains to devour – every zombie’s favorite meal. And so we have the long-debunked conspiracy theorist myth that scientists are falsifying temperature data to conjure global warming and frighten the masses. The story goes that in the raw temperature data from the continental USA, the second-hottest year on record was 1934, behind 2012. In the data adjusted by scientists, 1998 was the hottest year on record in the USA, until that record was broken in 2006 and then shattered in 2012 (1934 comes in 4th). The raw data are the gold standard, so this proves that climate scientists are falsifying data, right?  Wrong. Really, about as wrong as humanly possible. Scientists make adjustments to the raw data to remove factors that we know introduce biases and false trends. For example, temperature stations were once observed and data recorded in the afternoon, but later the observations switched to the mornings. Since mornings are colder than afternoons, that change introduced a cool bias into the raw data. Other factors that require adjustments include changes in the temperature monitoring system instrument setups, and the movement of temperature stations from one location to another. Scientists have put substantial effort into accounting for all these changes that introduce known biases in the raw data across thousands of temperature monitoring stations. It’s not a vast conspiracy to trick us into buying solar panels; it’s just good science, which even contrarian climate scientists don’t dispute. In fact, when we compare raw and adjusted temperature data across the surface of the whole planet, the difference between the two is barely noticeable. Yet we suddenly have Christopher Booker at The Telegraph and Fox News' Sean Hannity claiming that climate scientists are ‘fabricating’ and ‘manipulating’ the raw temperature data, despite the fact that even most contrarian bloggers see right through this myth.  So what happened? Shauna Theel at Media Matters documented the path that this zombie myth took, starting from a fringe denialist blog, making its way up the conservative media echo chamber ladder until it reached media outlets like The Telegraph and Fox News that purportedly care about factually accurate reporting. Tony Heller, a birther who criticizes climate science under the pseudonym ""Steven Goddard,"" wrote a blog post that claimed ""NASA cooled 1934 and warmed 1998, to make 1998 the hottest year in US history instead of 1934."" After the Drudge Report promoted a report of this allegation by the conservative British newspaper The Telegraph, conservative media from Breitbart to The Washington Times claimed the data was ""fabricated"" or ""faked."" On June 24, Fox & Friends picked it up, claiming that ""the U.S. has actually been cooling since the 1930s"" but scientists had ""faked the numbers"". Let’s take a few more shots at this zombie myth to see if we can send it back to its grave, temporarily.  Hence this particular myth is based on 2% of 2% of global warming, but it’s not even accurate for that 0.04%. The zombies are suggesting that we should rely on raw data that are known to be riddled with biases, and are claiming that scientific efforts to correct for those biases are part of some vast conspiracy. Some advice for journalists – the next time you hear a global warming myth that sounds too good to be true, before letting the zombie snack on your brains, check SkepticalScience.com first to see if it’s riddled with scientific debunking bullet wounds."
"Yes, Tony Abbott, it is “situation normal” for a government to have to deal with minor parties in the Senate to get its legislation through. But the way your team handled those “negotiations” in the Senate this week is not “situation normal” at all. In fact, in 26 years of reporting politics, I’ve never seen anything quite like it. It is extremely abnormal for a government Senate team to negotiate an amendment with a lower house MP and a gaggle of others in a corridor as journalists watch on and the clock ticks down on the government’s own gag motion.  The most abnormal thing in the current equation is Clive Palmer himself, who, unlike many crossbench senators in the past, has no discernible policy framework and appears mainly intent on using his Senate power to create havoc and place himself at the centre of things. This is, after all, the bloke who said this week, while launching a publication on the renewable energy target:, “When it comes to fighting climate sceptics you have to persevere.”  But before the election, asked on the ABC whether he agreed that global warming would have a big impact on Australia, he said: “No, I don't believe that's so. There's been global warming for a long time. I mean, all of Ireland was covered by ice at one time. There were no human inhabitants in Ireland. That's how the world has been going over millions and billions of years and Ross Garnaut knows that's true, so I think that's part of the natural cycle.” That kind of inconsistency, and the sheer number of crossbench senators, does make this situation particularly difficult.  But the government’s tactics have also been inept, trying to score quick political “wins” by insisting the new Senate sit almost immediately in July and then forcing through a vote, rather than taking the long and frustrating road of first locking down deals in the back rooms.  The closest Senate I can recall for unpredictability is the one Paul Keating had to deal with from 1993 to 1996, when Labor had to win over the Democrats and the Tasmanian independent Brian Harradine, or the two West Australian Greens, Dee Margetts and Christabel Chamarette. Keating, while forbidding then treasurer John Dawkins from attending a Senate estimates committee during the previous parliament, had already labelled the upper house “unrepresentative swill”. And that was before the 1993 Senate – which so stretched the patience of the government's then Senate leader, Gareth Evans, that he told Chamarette during negotiations over the Mabo native title laws to ''stick your bottom line up your bottom and get out of here''.  Recalling these similarities during Thursday’s dramas I tweeted, with – I thought – obvious sarcasm, that the Senate had not been this much fun since Margetts and Chamarette. The Daily Telegraph, bless them, thought I was seriously having a good time, and tut tutted in an editorial on Friday that “fun” wasn’t the word they would use for it. The senate hasn't been this much fun since Dee Margetts and Christabel Chamarette #auspol It’s nice to know they are paying such close attention, but the point of exhuming this piece of ancient history is that it provides some lessons for the government’s current policymaking dilemma. Despite Chamarette reportedly believing cognitive dissonance had a place in political decision-making, and despite Evans not being most people’s idea of a natural born conciliator, after weeks of long and exhausting negotiations and 238 amendments, the Mabo legislation was eventually passed. When it comes to the Senate, governments have to play the hand they are dealt, unless they are prepared to go back to the voters, which for a government trailing by 10 percentage points in two-party-preferred terms would not appear to be on the cards. And no amount of yelling from the House of Representatives, or from the editorial sidelines, or front page PhotoShopped pictures, is going to make the three Palmer United party senators go away. The government is going to have to work smarter, and slower, to lock in legislative deals. It is going to have to argue out the detail. Transparency could be the best way for the government to try to avoid chaos, or at least to prove that it is not chaos of its own creation. And it would always seem unwise to impose deadlines on itself that give Palmer the chance to create the drama he thrives on. It remains extremely likely that the carbon tax will be repealed next week. But ominously, next Friday is another deadline – the date after which electricity retailers say they cannot continue to act as though the tax is repealed if the parliament hasn’t actually done it. And the government is still negotiating last-minute changes to the last-minute amendment to the repeal bills proposed by Palmer. They haven’t yet started on the budget. The government needs new tactics, and quickly, to deal with this new normal."
"The Abbott government is continuing to resist entreaties to keep some of Labor’s carbon pricing architecture, with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, declaring repeal will more than likely proceed after the new senators take their places. Ross Garnaut – a key climate policy adviser to the former Labor government – on Friday urged the new government to preserve a system of emissions trading with a floating carbon price, and allow the use of international credits.  Garnaut reasoned this position would allow Australia to keep pace with international climate commitments, and also maintain a core climate policy, given the Senate’s opposition to the Coalition’s Direct Action alternative. “I suggest that all parties consider the advantages of keeping the emissions trading system structure established by existing legislation, remove the fixed price, and for the time being allow unlimited access to United Nations CDM credits,” Garnaut told a conference in Melbourne. “The price of emissions permits would fall to less than a dollar. The Climate Change Authority would advise on targets as required by existing legislation.” But Hunt told the same conference: “I respect Ross’s view but the tax goes, and it goes lock, stock and barrel.” The environment minister said without being presumptuous or banking the result before it happened, it appeared the numbers were there in the new Senate for repeal. Hunt said Australia wanted to be part of “a good international agreement that brings the big emitters in” – but he said the most likely outcome of current international discussions would be a pledge and review agreement at the end of next year, rather than legally binding targets. He argued the Coalition’s climate policy was actually a market mechanism that provided incentives for polluters to reduce emissions, while Labor’s “tax” was a penalty-based scheme. The government is banking on achieving repeal in the Senate either next week or the week after with the support of the Palmer United party voting bloc. The PUP leader, Clive Palmer, has indicated he will allow the fixed price scheme to go provided that power companies prove they have reduced electricity prices by the full amount of the carbon tax. But Palmer also wants to establish a new emissions trading scheme, with the price set at zero until Australia’s key trading partners – China, the US, the European Union, Japan and South Korea – have comparable carbon pricing schemes. On Friday, Palmer took to Twitter to reinforce the fact he wanted to preserve an emissions trading framework to replace Labor’s clean energy package. “I urge Tony Abbott govt to adopt Palmer United party amendments to ETS. Australia needs ETS in line with our major trading partners,” Palmer tweeted. The new senators take their places in the chamber next week, but the matter of when repeal actually proceeds remains somewhat in flux. A Senate committee report on the repeal bills is due to be tabled on 14 July. The government said on Friday the carbon bills could not be debated until the Environment and Communications Committee was able to table its report. The government is objecting to stalling around the tabling of the committee report. The manager of government business, Mitch Fifield, said on Friday the committee report was actually completed and therefore should be tabled early next week to allow the chamber debate to proceed. “We understand Labor and the Greens refused to participate in a meeting of the Environment and Communications Committee this morning, therefore depriving the committee of a quorum and stopping it from passing motions,” Fifield said. “The committee has finished its report on the carbon tax package of legislation and sought to table it before Monday, to allow debate to get underway as promptly as possible – but the underhand tactics of Labor and the Greens have so far prevented that.”"

"This week sees the National Portrait Gallery celebrating 25 years of sponsorship of its prestigious portrait award by the controversial oil company BP. Twenty-five years ago, people were less clear about the extent of the threat we face in terms of climate change, and there was less understanding about the damaging role oil companies have played both in terms of historic carbon emissions and stymieing efforts to tackle the problem. As arts practitioners and those working in arts institutions, we feel that the time is right for the cultural sector to be discussing alternatives to income gained from oil sponsorship in the same way that discussions about ending tobacco sponsorship took place more than two decades ago. Figures such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu have called for an apartheid-style boycott of fossil fuel companies, explicitly mentioning cultural institutions. Art shouldn't be used to legitimise the companies that are profiting from the destruction of a safe and habitable climate.Matthew Herbert (musician), Lucy Lippard (writer & activist), John Keane

"The UK’s ability to feed itself is threatened by “complacency” over the extreme weather driven by climate change and increasing competition for food as the world’s population grows, MPs warned on Tuesday. The environment, food and rural affairs (Efra) select committee said ministers must put plans in place to secure supplies of fruit and vegetables and the soya needed to feed the nation’s dairy herds, noting that the UK’s self-sufficiency for food that can be grown domestically has fallen from 87% to 68% in 20 years. The MPs also urged the embracing of technology, including genetically modified crops and robots that weed fields.  “Complacency is a genuine risk to future UK food security,” said Anne McIntosh, Conservative MP and chair of the Efra committee. “If we want our food production and supply systems to be secure, government and food producers must plan to meet the impacts of climate change, population growth and increasing global demand for food.” The report says the biggest long-term challenge to food production is the impact of extreme weather events resulting from climate change. One proposal to combat this, say the MPs, is for supermarkets shorten their supply chains. “It is clear this significantly reduces the threat of disruption and helps ensure consumers know exactly where their food comes from,” the MPs’ report states. The report found that levels of self-sufficiency in fruit and vegetables have fallen the most. The MPs recommended that farmers should seek to extend growing seasons by, for example, using giant greenhouses such as the vast Thanet Earth building that now produces one-third of all the UK’s cucumbers and tomatoes. The report also found a “heavy dependence” on imported soybeans to feed livestock and dairy herds and that almost 90% of the imports come from Brazil. But the MPs noted that fast-rising demand for protein in China, India and elsewhere meant competition for soybeans was a “significant strategic risk”. The MPs said” “The government needs to put in place a plan for alternative [UK- or EU-grown] animal feed.” In April, farming minister George Eustice told the Efra committee: “Food security is not just about self-sufficiency at a national level. Actually having open markets and free trade globally has got a very important role to play in making sure we have food security.” The MPs noted that yields of the UK’s most important staple crop, wheat, have not increased for at least 15 years. “There are many technological developments which could help to improve productivity in a sustainable manner,” the report concluded. It cited precision farming, where GPS location devices are used to tailor irrigation and fertiliser and pesticide use within fields. The report backs GM crops for the UK: “The government must address [public] concerns, using available science to counter food safety fears.” But it said there was not enough funding of research on agricultural technology. The report also warned that there were not enough young people taking up farming. “Efforts must be made to encourage new entrants who are willing and able to take advantage of new technologies in order to ensure the sector is modern and competitive.”“This report recognises the UK’s food security is well protected. We invest £450 million every year to uphold it but we are not complacent which is why our £160 million Agri-Tech Strategy is investing in developing new resilient varieties of crops, more efficient use of water and a world class centre of agricultural innovation. We are confident our efforts will help us meet future demand for food.” The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, is an enthusiastic supporter of GM crops but has almost halved the funding for adaptation to climate change in the UK. The last goverment published a 20-year food security strategy in 2010 but food security is not one of the current food and farming policies being prioritised by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A Defra spokeswoman said: “This report recognises the UK’s food security is well protected. We invest £450 million every year to uphold it but we are not complacent which is why our £160 million agri-tech strategy is investing in developing new resilient varieties of crops, more efficient use of water and a world class centre of agricultural innovation. We are confident our efforts will help us meet future demand for food.”"

"David Rose and The Mail on Sunday produce the most reliable global warming journalism, in the sense that they can be relied upon to consistently misrepresent climate science. Their latest piece focuses on Antarctic sea ice. You might wonder why we should particularly care about Antarctic sea ice. The answer is that it provides a nice distraction from rapidly declining Arctic sea ice, glaciers around the world, the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, the warming oceans, the warming atmosphere, and so on. Antarctic sea ice has bucked these trends by modestly increasing in extent and volume.  To put this increase in context, the volume of Antarctic sea ice has risen by about 7.5% since 1992, according to a recent study. The volume of Arctic sea ice, on the other hand, has declined by about 75% since 1980. Antarctica has been gaining about 30 cubic kilometers (km3) of sea ice volume per year, while the Arctic has been losing 10 times as much – 300 km3 per year. What's causing Antarctic sea ice to increase is an interesting scientific question. After all, the Antarctic region is warming, including its oceans. As a result, two recent studies concluded that the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet is already underway and is unstoppable.  Some studies have suggested that the influx of cold fresh water from melting Antarctic ice shelves may be contributing to the increase in Antarctic sea ice. Others argue the increase can be explained by natural variability. Yet others have suggested that the increase may not be real, but rather an error in satellite measurements, although this explanation seems unlikely.  Human influences may be responsible, or they might not. This remains an open question that climate scientists are investigating. It's also true that global climate models tend to have difficulty in simulating the Antarctic sea ice increase. While they're good with the big global picture, regional changes are more challenging for climate models.  Meanwhile, surface temperatures in 2014 are on pace to be the hottest on record. Despite this, David Rose at The Mail on Sunday tells us, Prof Curry also revealed that because of the ‘pause’, in which world average temperatures have not risen for more than 16 years, the Arctic ice decline has been ‘touted’ by many as the most important evidence for continued global warming.  First of all, surface temperatures have risen over the past 16 years. Second, during that time the planet as a whole has accumulated heat at a rate equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second. I don't know who the ""many"" are that Curry refers to in the above quote, the most important evidence for continued global warming is quite obviously the measurements that show the planet continues to warm. And contrary to Curry's refuted hypothesis, which she also references in Rose's piece, the warming and rapid sea ice decline in the Arctic are mostly human-caused. The Mail piece finishes with a blurb written by contrarian climate blogger Andrew Montford (consistent with the accuracy of the rest of the piece, the Mail spells his name wrong). Montford rehashes the zombie climate myth that climate scientists are somehow fudging the surface temperature record. He claims, In recent days a new scandal over the integrity of temperature data has emerged, this time in America, where it has been revealed as much as 40 per cent of temperature data there are not real thermometer readings. This manufactured scandal centers around the fact that climate scientists use statistical techniques to fill in gaps in areas without temperature station coverage. That includes areas where one of thousands of surface temperature stations around the world goes out of service.  The accuracy of that statistical and scientific approach has been confirmed by the Koch-funded Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group. The accuracy of the surface temperature record has been proven over and over and over again. Continuing to deny its accuracy by manufacturing ""scandals"" is, well, denial. The bottom line is that while the reason behind the increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is an open and interesting scientific question, it doesn't detract from our understanding of the climate as a whole. The planet is still warming rapidly, including the Antarctic, and Antarctica is also losing immense amounts of land-based ice that are contributing to global sea level rise.  It appears that The Mail on Sunday wants us to lose sight of the burning forest for the trees."
"Hugh Muir reports on the leaked decision by the BBC to uphold a complaint about an interview on climate change with Lord Lawson on the Today programme on 13 February. Justin Webb interviewed both Lawson and Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London, about the link between climate change and the winter floods this winter.  Lawson wrongly claimed that it was not possible for scientists to connect the flooding to climate change, and then went on to falsely suggest that there was no evidence for an increase in any extreme weather events. The BBC Editorial Complaints Unit has now concluded that the interview broke guidelines about the need to ensure due accuracy in its news programmes. Although it has not yet formally announced the decision, I was told by e-mail on 4 June that it was planning to announce the verdict soon. In a letter dated 13 May which outlined its provisional decision, Fraser Steel, the Head of Editorial Complaints, stated: I have understood you to say that the interviews [sic] created a ‘false balance between climate scientists and climate change sceptics and as a result gave an inaccurate and misleading impression of the evidence. I have to say that I share your broad impression and I am therefore upholding your complaint. He added: As you have pointed out, Lord Lawson’s views are not supported by the evidence from computer modelling and scientific research and I don’t believe this was made sufficiently clear to the audience. This represents a complete turnaround by the BBC which initially sought to justify the interview. Ceri Thomas, Head of Programmes at BBC News, defended the programme on the grounds that  Lord Lawson is not a scientist, but as a former chancellor of the Exchequer is well qualified to comment on the economic arguments, which are a legitimate area for debate. However, listeners to Today heard Lawson use most of his air-time to dispute the science of climate change, and argue with Hoskins about the evidence. The BBC should not have been surprised that Lawson made inaccurate and misleading statements about the science of climate change as he had done so in previous appearances on its programmes. Furthermore, he was no doubt invited to participate in the interview on Today because he rejects the scientific evidence and chairs a campaign group for climate change ‘sceptics’, the Global Warming Policy Foundation. This error of judgment is the result of a confused and muddled approach by some BBC programmes over how to cover climate change. While BBC science and environment correspondents generally do an excellent job of reporting news about climate change, many of its presenter-led programmes mislead their audiences by attempting on occasion to be impartial between facts and fallacies. In a report for the BBC Trust in 2011, Prof Steve Jones warned of the dangers of giving air-time to climate change ‘sceptics’. Although the BBC’s official response to the report appeared to accept his recommendations, David Jordan, the Director of Editorial Policy and Standards, told the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology last July that the corporation had rejected Professor Jones’s suggestions about the coverage of climate change. However, common sense now appears to be prevailing at the BBC with this recognition that the interview with Lord Lawson breached its editorial guidelines. What is now needed is for an investigation by the BBC and BBC Trust into why the report by Jones has not been fully implemented, and to strengthen its editorial procedures such that the responsibility to achieve due accuracy in its news programmes is not sacrificed again for the sake of a muddled notion of impartiality between scientists and climate change ‘sceptics’. Although this should not mean that ‘sceptics’ are banned from appearing on BBC news programmes, it does mean that editors should take into account the greater risk they create of inaccurate and misleading information being broadcast, and to take necessary precautions. For instance, interviews with climate change ‘sceptics’ could be followed by commentaries by science and environment correspondents who could correct any errors. And the BBC should also take into account that the views of climate change ‘sceptics’ are already hugely over-represented in media coverage, giving the public the false impression that there is no scientific consensus over the causes and potential consequences."

"To maintain Europe’s emissions-cutting momentum, a 30% cut in energy usage is needed by 2030, rising to 35% if the EU wants to reap the benefits of energy security, jobs and growth, says a draft communication for the bloc’s energy efficiency review, seen by EurActiv. The target would be indicative – or non-binding on member-states – until 2017 at least, and would be based on an absolute reduction in primary energy consumption of 1312 Million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) for the 35% figure, and 1218 Mtoe for the 30% goal.  The paper is broadly in line with findings from an impact assessment revealed by EurActiv last week, which show that higher efficiency targets would bring optimum levels of GDP growth, jobs, energy security and emissions cuts. But no agreement on a final goal to complement a planned 40% greenhouse gas emissions cut was reached at a meeting between the EU president José Manuel Barroso and a cabinet of top Commissioners on 18 June.  Barroso himself is thought sympathetic to a robust 2030 energy savings target, and is said to have given a green light to the energy and climate commissioners, Günther Oettinger and Connie Hedegaard, to push for a higher headline figure than 25%. A number in the 30%-35% range remains firmly in play. This faces strong opposition though from the EU’s secretary-general Catherine Day, a key power in the current Commission regime, who is holding out for a 25%-27% energy savings goal on grounds of cost-effectiveness.  “The bottom line is that this [target] has to be fully in line with the rest of the 2030 package, it has to be politically acceptable, it also has to be technically feasible,” one EU official said. “If you have a higher energy efficiency target then that has implications for costs in the non-ETS (Emissions Trading System) sectors, especially for some member states.” The position is grounded in upfront investment costs, a particular form of modelling, and parts of the 2030 impact assessment which anticipate citizens taking low carbon investment decisions on the basis of a €40 per tonne carbon price by 2030, in the 40% of Europe’s industry that the ETS covers. Environmentalists argue that this is “ivory tower thinking,” because it assumes that the carbon price will one day drive home-owners to renovate their houses and farmers to change their livestock. Speaking at a German-Danish 2030 targets workshop on 18 June, the Green MEP Claude Turmes, simply asked: “Where is the political majority for that sort of carbon price?” Recent attempts to modestly raise the cost of allowances provoked strong reaction from business lobbies, even though the current price of around €5 a tonne is far too low to affect investments in energy efficiency or renewables. Despite grumbles from Barroso's office that their lobbying is fragmentary and counter-productive, officials in the EU's energy and climate action departments insist that targeted energy saving measures will deliver quantifiable emissions reductions, without threatening the ETS itself.  In the short term, the new draft communication proposes: The bloc’s 28 member states are already committed to a 2020 target that would slash energy consumption by 20%, compared to 2005 levels. According to the communication, “with full implementation and monitoring of already-adopted legislation, the EU can put itself on track to achieve this target, saving 170 Mtoe.” “But we cannot be complacent,” the document adds. “The Commission therefore intends to return to the topic in 2017, in particular to review whether national implementation is going as intended, or whether it is necessary to revert to the issue of binding energy efficiency targets.” Sources close to the EU president’s office say that it would be a mistake to conclude from the impact assessment and draft communication that recommendations for higher efficiency targets had been “concreted”.  A Brussels consensus holds that the 40% goal favoured by the new impact assessment would be unacceptable to the UK and Visegrad countries, but that a ‘binding at EU-level’ energy savings target, probably higher than 27%, would eventually be forthcoming. The January 2030 package proposed a 27% indicative target for the share of renewable energy in countries’ national energy mixes, even though its impact assessment found that a 30% goal would create 568,000 more jobs and save €260 billion in fossil fuel imports.  Industry sources say that any attempt now to over-ride the findings of the EU’s efficiency impact assessment and communication would raise questions about the wisdom of spending so much money on them in the first place. “Impact assessments are made to be followed and if they’re not, that is not a very cost-effective use of Commission or tax-payers resources,” Andoni Hildago, a spokesman for the European Insulation Manufacturers Association told EurActiv."
"Redheads, rest easy: your chances of climate change-induced extinction are identical to those of people with less exhilarating hair colour. This seemingly obvious fact will no doubt drown in the current deluge of coverage declaring that gingers are genetically doomed. The source? A company that sells genetic ancestry testing. Let's deal with the science. Red hair is caused by changes in a single gene, and exists in the overall population at about 4-5%, making it beautifully rare. Its increased prevalence in Scots (and the Welsh and English, and other northern European populations) is probably due to a degree of isolation in an ancestral group at some point in our ancient history. The gene is recessive, which means that both parents have to pass it on for their child to be red-haired. Various reports quote a scientist ""who did not wish to be named"" saying ""I think the regressive gene is slowly dying out"". I've studied and written about genetics for 20 years now, and I've not come across ""regressive"" genes before. I'm willing to give this mystery scientist leeway that this was an error by the journalist, and the enigmatic-but-no-doubt-very-credible researcher meant ""recessive"". The question of whether humans are still evolving crops up every now and then. Our genes change over time, and the frequency of those genes in populations changes too. The change is slow, and we have largely unshackled ourselves from the forces of natural selection. In this particular case, it is very hard to think of a way that the ginger gene might be extinguished. The selective pressure asserted in this tale is that redheads exist as an adaptation to cloudy weather in Scotland. Alas, there is scant evidence for that – scientists are still debating if the red-hair gene or, indeed, any of the genes that affect skin, hair and eye colour, spread because of a lack of sunlight, or because of some sort of mate preference, or just by offchance. Nor am I aware of any evidence that Scotland is getting less cloudy as a result of climate change. To become extinct, ginger hair would have to be a powerfully maladaptive condition, which of course it is not. It's a very lovely condition. Here's how the ginger gene could vanish: not only would every redhead have to stop having sex for some reason, but every carrier of the gene would too. As someone who finds red hair rather attractive, should this come to pass, I will volunteer to help them out of their imaginary celibate rut. Sadly, unless some Eric Cartman-esque genocide transpires, I am supremely confident that my services will not be required. Now, if this were a hair commercial, I would move on by saying ""that was the science bit"". In fact, this whole tedious saga is just an advertisement – and science by press release. Finding out your redhead genetic status is merely a £25 add-on to one of the genetic ancestry packages from ScotlandsDNA. The company's chief executive, Alistair Moffat, is the source of this latest septic wave of genetic astrology. Moffat is the rector of St Andrews University. I can find no evidence that he has any qualifications in genetics, though this has not deterred him from frequent assertions about the subject. In 2012, Moffat appeared on Radio 4's Today programme making some unsupported claims concerning the ancestry of some Brits being Tuareg, Berber and even the Queen of Sheba. Geneticists David Balding and Mark Thomas from University College London issued complaints to the BBC, to the company's chief scientist, Jim Wilson from Edinburgh University, and a detailed letter to Moffat pointing out the multiple fallacies in his claims. Following the complaints, Moffat wrote to the then provost of UCL, Malcolm Grant, demanding that he force Balding and Thomas to back off. Grant told him that he would do well to respect academic freedom – a polite scholarly way of telling him to sod off. Legal threats were issued and the whole sorry saga is documented in necessary detail on the UCL website. Last year, following a press release from Moffat's sister company, BritainsDNA, many newspapers devoted chunky column inches to the revelation that Prince William carries Indian DNA. It took a genetic genealogist – Debbie Kennett, an honorary fellow at UCL – to thoroughly debunk this wobbly piece of scientific trivia. These promises of DNA and ancestry are everywhere. They are seductive because they are simple and clean, but alas humans are not. We are messy, and our DNA is almost inscrutable. Genetics is complex, and anyone who tells you different is selling something. I will be plugging my own book on the stories we can and can't tell about human genetics in a year's time. There is so much joy and wonder in science, in the poetry locked in our genomes. Its publication is now put off by one day, as today I chose to write not about the marvel of DNA, but to prick this bubble of flapdoodle."
"Bill Shorten has vowed to re-fight the case for effective action against global warming, as he conceded Labor had underestimated the impact of the “anti-climate change brigade”. The opposition leader reflected on the breakdown in Australia’s political and public consensus on climate change in a speech which laid out some markers on leadership and the way to win over voters for contentious reforms.  Shorten traced the current fault line on climate policy to Tony Abbott’s rolling of Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader in 2009, but said Labor had “to live with our failure to prosecute the case, to take the public with us on the need for action on climate change”. Facing the likelihood of the new Senate voting soon to repeal the carbon scheme introduced by the former Gillard government and which began in 2012 with a three-year fixed price, Shorten reaffirmed his commitment to a market-based system for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. And in a swipe at the budget sales pitch, he accused Abbott of trying to divide the public and adopting a “Downton Abbey style of consensus where he sits in the dining room and he summons Australians like a servant class to agree with his consensus”. Shorten’s speech to the Australian National Union’s Crawford Australian Leadership Forum on Tuesday coincided with the Senate changeover, in which a combination of minor and micro parties and independents now holding the balance of power. Emboldened by the Palmer United party’s (PUP) support for scrapping the legislated carbon pricing scheme, Abbott told his Coalition colleagues on Tuesday he was confident of the government’s ability to work with the crossbench to axe “the world’s biggest carbon tax” – a dominant election pledge. “I am reasonably optimistic that we can do good things together for our country and for the benefit of our people,” the prime minister said. Shorten said an emissions trading scheme previously enjoyed bipartisan support, with both John Howard and Kevin Rudd promising one at the 2007 election. This consensus ended with Abbott’s successful challenge to Turnbull as Liberal leader in 2009, which Shorten described as “the victory of the denialists over science”. “If you look at one of the key fault lines in Australia, it started in 2009 when Tony Abbott and the sceptics and the denialists and the internet trolls rolled Malcolm Turnbull, and ever since that day we have seen a breakdown in consensus,” Shorten said at a media conference before his speech. “I have got no doubt that Labor underestimated the impact that the anti-climate change brigade had. I have got no doubt that our scientific community, if they had their time again, would wish that they could have explained things differently as well.” Shorten, who has campaigned against the government’s “cruel” first budget and maintains a lead in opinion polls, has been accused by the Coalition of irresponsibly blocking measures to repair the nation’s finances. Shorten said leaders who wanted voters to support major reforms must convince them of the merits of change. “That lesson also is for Labor when it comes to climate: we have got to re-litigate the case and I don’t think Labor was expecting that we’d have to go back to first principles,” Shorten said. “We thought the science was in and we thought that most people out in the community were on board with that process. They were, but what we didn't recognise was getting mud from the far right in Australian politics and we have to re-fight the case for climate change and we will.” Labor has rarely asked about climate change in parliamentary question time since last year's election. Labor also muddied the debate by vowing to “terminate” the carbon tax if it won the September election, adopting some of the language of the Coalition. The pledge was to keep the scheme but to amend it to move to a floating price a year earlier than planned. In his speech, Shorten said Abbott had “played the politics of division hard, and he prevailed”. While there was no shrinking from Labor’s failure to prosecute the case, he said he knew of many business leaders who regretted speaking against an emissions trading scheme because the nation had experienced “five years of lost certainty and economic opportunity”. Many members of the Greens, and the broader environmental movement, lamented “choosing the purity of impotence over the practical benefits of reasonable compromise” in opposing Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme as not ambitious enough, he said. Many Liberals also rued passing up the chance to move together “on an issue that will define this century”. The lack of progress at the 2009 climate change conference in Copenhagen also played a role. Shorten noted “hoopla and showmanship” in the joint announcement by the PUP leader, Clive Palmer, and the climate crusader Al Gore on carbon policy last week, but emphasised “significant points of climate consensus” including the retention of the renewable energy target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the Climate Change Authority. Palmer has vowed to abolish the carbon tax as long as power price reductions were guaranteed, and expressed in-principle support for an emissions trading scheme once trading partners took similar action. Shorten sought to remind Palmer that Labor had already legislated such a scheme and it was “ready for implementation”. Setting our future principles for climate action, Shorten said Labor’s support for an emissions trading scheme had not changed, as global warming required a serious, global, considered response. The party’s response would include “a market-based framework capable of interacting with, and benefiting from, similar schemes in the US, Europe and Asia”. Shorten said he believed good policy, clearly articulated and explained and argued, would win the support of the electorate. He cited the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS), which he championed when Labor was in government, as an example of serious, nation-changing reform, well argued, in “the Hawke-Keating tradition”. The argument became so compelling that Labor was “even able to pass a tax to fund it, through an increase in the Medicare levy”. Abbott has previously criticised Shorten’s performance and unwillingness to embrace reform, saying the opposition leader was “no Bob Hawke”.  In broader observations about the state of national debate, Shorten pointed out that claims about a lack of political consensus were nothing new, but warned that “debilitating cynicism” and apathy were “more difficult opponents for us than even Tony Abbott”. He said it should be a “wake-up call” for all politicians that about 2.8 million Australians who were eligible to participate in last year’s federal election missed out on having their votes counted, either through not enrolling, not attending, or casting informal ballots. Shorten said the solution was to empower people, fostering the belief that politics was still capable of changing the world and local lives."

"Clive Palmer appears set to demand legislative guarantees that the carbon tax repeal will flow through to lower household power bills, as the government presses new senators to “axe the tax” within two weeks of taking their seats to avoid enormous commercial uncertainty. The Abbott government is counting on the Palmer United party and two other crossbench senators to provide the necessary votes to finally repeal the carbon tax soon after the new Senate sits on 7 July, but PUP now appears likely to place conditions on its support.  Palmer, whose policy was to back the repeal, says he will unveil his party’s “final position” on Wednesday. He has previously said his senators will demand “the full savings power companies receive under a repeal are handed on to everyday Australians”. The government believes this is already ensured by the powers it has given the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor price changes after repeal, but a spokesman for Palmer told Guardian Australia the ACCC powers in the government’s bill were “definitely not sufficient”. As well as amendments or assurances on pricing, Palmer may also ask for another parliamentary inquiry into aspects of the repeal. Any delay would cause commercial complications.  And further complicating this first item of business for the new Senate, sources said the Motoring Enthusiast Party senator Ricky Muir had not been consulted about Wednesday’s announcement and could also consider alternative amendments being proposed by independent senator Nick Xenophon.  The government is assured of the votes of Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhelm and Family First senator Bob Day, but needs four more, which means one vote in addition to the three PUP senators.  The prime minister, Tony Abbott, reintroduced the carbon tax repeal bills into the House of Representatives on Monday, in preparation for them to be considered as soon as the new Senate sits. “It will be dealt with urgently by the new Senate after 1 July and I expect this carbon tax – this toxic tax – to be gone ... every crossbench member of the Senate has stated opposition to the carbon tax, which is why I think the public are entitled to be confident that the carbon tax will be gone – will be gone after the first of July,” Abbott said. The chairman of the ACCC said he believed his organisation “has all the power it needs”. “The law says you can’t have a carbon component in your pricing … it says companies have to show they will take the carbon component out of their pricing and if they don’t we have the power to act,” he said. The government has decreed that the repeal takes effect from 1 July, and power companies have agreed to take it out of their contracts from that date, but only for two weeks. If the existing law continues after that fortnight they will revert to passing on the cost of the $24.50 carbon price until it is actually repealed under law.  As well as complicating power pricing, a delayed repeal opens the possibility that emissions intensive industries could reap a windfall from receiving free permits and then selling them back to the clean energy regulator. Guardian Australia reported this would be a potential windfall of $9m for Palmer’s wholly-owned Queensland Nickel. Reintroducing the carbon tax repeal bills, which have already been voted down once by the Senate, Abbott said: “The Australian people have already voted on this bill … the people have spoken and now it is up to this parliament to show that it has listened. “The ACCC will be ready to ensure these price reductions will be passed on to businesses … but families and pensioners will keep the tax cuts and benefit increases already provided.” The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said anything other than a rapid repeal of the carbon tax bills would be “an act of legislative vandalism”. The positioning ahead of the Senate vote comes as a new poll for the Climate Institute found that for the first time more people support carbon pricing than oppose it. According to the poll, 34% back the carbon pricing laws, up 6% on 2012. Public opposition to carbon pricing has collapsed by 22% since 2012, when the Coalition was repeatedly attacking the then Labor government over the policy, the poll found."
"The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) is set to join the list of climate change agencies protected by the new Senate, with Motoring Enthusiast senator Ricky Muir and the Palmer United party (PUP) saying they will vote down government attempts to abolish it. Muir had announced he would try to amend the carbon tax repeal bills to stop an initial $435m in funding being stripped from the clean energy body and then also try to prevent its abolition. His amendment was very similar to one circulated by the Greens.  He has now done a deal with PUP to allow the $435m in cuts to proceed in return for a commitment that the three PUP senators would also vote against Arena’s abolition. The government wants to return $1.3bn in Arena funding to the budget, and then have the industry department oversee about $900m in funding deals that have already been struck. With Labor and the Greens also intent on saving Arena, the decision by Muir and the PUP senators will cost the government another $1.3bn in budgeted savings. Earlier on Wednesday, the Senate voted against the repeal of about $2bn in tax cuts that were legislated but then deferred by the former Labor government. Muir said in a statement he and PUP “have agreed to oppose the abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and will vote against the government’s forthcoming legislation Australian Renewable Energy (Repeal) Bill”.  Muir said he would not not proceed with his amendment to stop the immediate funding cut to Arena that is included in the carbon repeal bills. PUP senators have already promised to stop the government’s plan to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the existing renewable energy target. The government is seeking to effectively close Arena before legislation passes by refusing to reappoint board members as their terms expire. In a separate statement, PUP leader Clive Palmer said “The Palmer United party will not vote for the government’s other upcoming legislation that seeks to abolish Arena altogether. I had extensive discussion with former United States vice-president Al Gore about Arena and was convinced by his arguments in support of this important agency.” But he said PUP would not vote against the immediate funding cuts because it believed “Arena should be held accountable and making some budget savings was reasonable in the current circumstances”."
"The Australian public is deeply unhappy over the government’s response to the challenge of climate change, amid a revival in support for climate science and a strengthening belief that Australia is already feeling the impact of a warming planet, according to new polling. The Climate of the Nation poll, conducted by JWS Research among 1,145 adult Australians on behalf of the Climate Institute, found that 70% accepted the mainstream scientific position that climate change is occurring.  This is a 10% increase compared to when the same question was asked in the poll in 2012, suggesting a rebounding public belief in the findings of the overwhelming majority of climate scientists. A further 89% said the effects of climate change were already beginning to bite in Australia. But while more than half of respondents felt the federal government was the primary body which should address climate change, there was a negative rating of -18 when people were asked to rank the government’s performance. This compares to a -1 rating from last year. These rankings are the differential between respondents’ ""good"" versus’ ""poor"" response to the government’s performance. Some 57% of those polled said the government should take climate change more seriously. A mere 20% of those questioned said they are convinced that Tony Abbott is concerned about climate change, with 53% feeling that he isn’t. Nearly a third of people believe opposition leader Bill Shorten is worried about the problem, with around the same proportion of people thinking the reverse is true. In a further blow to the Coalition, for the first time more people support carbon pricing than oppose it. According to the poll, 34% back the carbon pricing laws, up 6% on 2012. Public opposition to carbon pricing has collapsed by 22% since 2012, when the Coalition was repeatedly attacking the then Labor government over the policy, the poll found. The finding comes ahead of the latest government attempt to repeal the carbon pricing mechanism on Monday. So far, the dismantling of the carbon price, as well as the scrapping of associated bodies such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, has been blocked by a combination of Labor and Greens senators. According to the poll, 47% of people think that carbon pricing is preferable to no climate change policy, with just 22% supporting the government’s alternative Direct Action policy, which will offer voluntary grants to businesses keen to reduce their carbon emissions. Meanwhile, 61% of respondents said they want Australia to be a leader in tackling climate change, up 9% from 2012, amid solid support for renewable energy initiatives. On the Renewable Energy Target, which the government is currently reviewing amid speculation it may be wound back or scrapped, 71% of respondents said they want the target to be 20% or higher by 2020. A further 76% said there should be government incentives for renewable energy, such as wind and solar. John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, which railed against climate change ‘dinosaurs’ alongside former Liberal leader John Hewson on Sunday, said there was a strong public expectation for politicians to tackle climate change. “There is mistrust of both Tony Abbott and Bill Shorten regarding their attitudes on climate change, but particularly Tony Abbott,” Connor said. “Yet a clear majority think the Abbott government should take climate change more seriously. “These and many of the other findings this year reinforce that while the dinosaurs in politics and business are roaring across our landscape, the majority of Australians are shrewder about the impacts, the opportunities and the need for leadership.”"
"China will exempt electric cars and other types of ""new energy"" vehicles from purchase tax, the government said, as it seeks to reduce pollution and conserve resources. The State Council, or cabinet, said that buyers of new energy vehicles – fully electric, hybrid and fuel cell cars –would not have to pay the levy from September to the end of 2017, according to a statement.  The tax is 10% of the net value of the vehicle, according to state media. ""For achieving industrial development and environmental protection, this is a win-win,"" the state council said in a statement on Wednesday. The exemption applies to imported vehicles as well as domestically produced ones, the statement said, adding the government would compile a catalogue of eligible models. China has sought to increase ownership of electric and hybrid vehicles to ease chronic pollution and reduce reliance on oil imports, but high prices, lack of infrastructure and consumer reluctance have been obstacles. The government has set a target of having five million new energy vehicles on the streets by 2020. But China has only 70,000 currently in use, the China Daily newspaper reported on Thursday. The central government also offers outright subsidies for electric passenger car buyers, which were set at $5,700 to $9,800 last year, while local incentives can bring the price down further. Lack of charging stations and the desires of Chinese consumers - many first time owners - for big, flashy vehicles have hurt electric car sales. Policymakers are seeking to move away from state spending to domestic consumption as a key driver of the economy, which has been slowing. Several foreign auto makers have announced plans to develop environmentally-friendly vehicles in China, despite the currently small market. US electric car maker Tesla Motors has also caused a stir with aggressive marketing and by pitching its imported vehicles to luxury buyers in China, although analysts say they might only find a niche market."
"Drax, the operator of Britain's biggest power station, has secured up to €300m (£238m) of European Union funding to build a power plant whose carbon dioxide emissions will be trapped and buried deep beneath the North Sea. The new plant will be built on land next to Drax's existing power station near Selby in Yorkshire. It will burn enough coal for 630,000 homes and 90% of its CO2 will be transported by pipeline for permanent storage under the North Sea.  The project, called White Rose, is a joint venture between Drax, Alstom and BOC and is the first large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in the EU. White Rose will capture and bury the plant's CO2 with transport and storage provided by National Grid. Leigh Hackett, chief executive of Capture Power, which runs White Rose, said: ""The NER300 award represents another significant milestone for us in our development programme and an important potential source of funding for the project, as well as providing a strong signal for CCS in Europe. ""We are well on track to demonstrate the key role that CCS can play in the future UK energy mix. CCS is an important technology providing clean, reliable and cost competitive electricity with the potential to contribute greatly to the decarbonisation of global power markets."" Parliament's energy and climate change committee called in May for the UK's first CCS plants to be fast-tracked because they were vital to limit climate change. The MPs criticised the government's conduct of its £1bn competition for the first plants. White Rose applied for funding from the European NER300 programme a year ago. NER300 is a fund set up by the European Commission to encourage low-carbon energy projects. The award to White Rose is one of 19 to projects across the EU totalling €1bn. They are designed to encourage private investment in green energy programmes. Connie Hedegaard, EU commissioner for climate action, said: ""With these first-of-a-kind projects, we will help protect the climate and make Europe less energy dependent. The €1bn we are awarding today will leverage some additional €900m of private investment."""
"Australia could slash its carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and still experience average economic growth of 2.4% a year, according to a UN-backed study. The Deep Decarbonisation Pathways report, released by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, analysed the 15 countries that account for 70% of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, which includes Australia, the US, Britain and China.  According to the report, compiled by academics from each of the countries, the 15 countries could make deep cuts to emissions while also tripling economic output. These cuts are needed, the report notes, if the world is to avoid the “catastrophic” impact of failing to keep to the internationally agreed limit of 2C global warming on pre-industrial levels. The study concedes the world is on track to overshoot this. The study notes that Australia has high per-capita emissions, with coal-fired power providing 69% of electricity generation, higher than most other industrialised countries. Despite this dependence on fossil fuels, “fundamental changes” to Australia’s energy system could allow it to cut its emissions to zero by 2050 while maintaining economic growth of 2.4% a year, on average. The report points out that Australia’s greenhouse gases have remained stable over the past 20 years, while the size of the economy has doubled. A further UN report in September will set out the monetary cost of a rapid increase in renewables to cut emissions to zero. But the newly released study plots a path that involves phasing out coal use almost entirely, shifting electricity generation to renewable sources such as solar and wind, and powering vehicles and buildings with clean electricity rather than fossil fuels such as oil and petrol. Industrial and farming processes that can’t use such clean technology would be offset by large-scale storage of carbon in soils and trees. Anna Skarbek, the executive director of ClimateWorks, which provided input to the report alongside the Australian National University, told Guardian Australia that emissions cuts and economic growth could go hand-in-hand. “Australia has a higher emissions intensity than other countries, but it also has a huge natural endowment in renewable energy sources,” she said. “Unlike many other countries, we are blessed with multiple renewable sources, as well as a much larger capacity for carbon forestry and biofuels. We can change our focus in energy systems rather than change economic growth. Australia has made successful changes in the past, from gold to wool to wheat, even in the rise of the internet in the past decade.” Skarbek said the transition would need to start soon to help avoid breaching the 2C limit, a temperature guardrail that has bipartisan support in Australian politics. “The science is clear – we know that the carbon budget is being rapidly used up and will be near zero by the middle of the century,” she said. “If we plan now we can achieve the transition in this time.” Frank Jotzo, director of the ANU centre for climate economics and policy, said: “Decarbonisation would mean that the energy system and some aspects of land management look quite different from what they would under a high-carbon scenario. “But for every declining technology there are new opportunities arising, and most of the economy would simply motor on. Cleaning up the world’s energy system does not stand in the way of economic prosperity.” The Australian government has a minimum target of a 5% cut in carbon emissions by 2020, based on 2000 levels. Governments will gather in Paris next year to thrash out their emission cut commitments beyond 2020. A spokesman for the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said: “The government will review Australia’s 2020 target in 2015, considering further action and targets on the basis of comparable real global action.”"
"The government has been accused of significantly watering down its official advice on extreme weather after removing mention of links between climate change and events such as bushfires and heatwaves. A document on the Department of Environment’s website, aimed at informing the public on how climate change is influencing dangerous weather, has removed an explicit reference linking the two.  A previous version of the document opened with the statement: “There is a growing and robust body of evidence that climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. “Australia has experienced an increasing number and intensity of heatwaves, bushfires, flooding and droughts in recent decades.” An amendment to the page removes these lines in favour of a general explanation of what extreme weather is. The page goes on to acknowledge that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is “changing” and that “some studies” show a link to climate change, but stresses that it is “difficult to isolate the role of climate change in any given event”. As Guardian Australia reported in October, the previous version of the departmental advice contradicted Tony Abbott’s view that any link between bushfires and climate change was “complete hogwash”. The prime minister, speaking in the wake of the widespread New South Wales bushfires last year, also said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief, was “talking out of her hat” for linking rising temperatures to increased bushfires. Amanda McKenzie, a former government official and now chief executive of the Climate Council, told Guardian Australia the amendment had led to “softer language” on the link between climate change and extreme weather. “Lives and communities are at risk from bushfires so it’s very important that communities and firefighting services are prepared for changes that we are already seeing,” she said. “There is a common misconception that Australia has always had extreme weather so we should not be concerned now, but we are already seeing more forceful, extreme weather. Bushfires have increased in south-east Australia in the past 30 years, and we’ve just had our hottest 12 months on record. “The evidence is absolutely unequivocal on the link. We know bushfire conditions are getting worse. We have to take the government on its word that it takes climate change seriously but there have been inaccurate statements made around extreme weather and it’s critical the public is provided the right information on these matters.” Asked why the advice was changed, an environment department spokeswoman said: “During the past few months, we have been finalising the transition of content from the former climate change website to environment.gov.au. “The Department of the Environment’s website is constantly updated. The change you identified was made by the department to ensure the website information remained consistent with the approach taken by the IPCC in its fifth assessment report.” The IPCC assessment, released in March, stated there was a “medium to high confidence” that extreme weather events are “projected to increase in many locations” in Australia. Australia is at risk from “increased damage to ecosystems and settlements, economic losses and risks to human life from wildfires in most of southern Australia”, according to the IPCC report. In addition, “projected increases in heatwaves will increase heat-related deaths and hospitalisations, especially among the elderly”, while coastal areas will be at risk from erosion, landslides and flooding, owing to weather pattern changes and sea level rises. Kellie Caught, climate change campaigner at WWF, said: ""The link between global warming and extreme weather events is clear. In fact, the IPCC fifth assessment report strengthened its assessment on the link between some extreme weather events and global warming.  ""It’s important that the Australian public are informed on the science of global warming and climate change from the leading experts such as the IPCC, especially given global warming poses a risk to society, our economy and environment.” The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said: “Regardless of whether Tony Abbott’s global warming denial is filtering top-down through the public service, the clear link between climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is undeniable. “The link is the global scientific consensus. No amount of watering down of language or silencing the public service will change the urgency of strong and sustained action to reduce greenhouse pollution.”"
"The Great Barrier Reef is set to be ravaged by the expected El Niño weather phenomenon and scientists warn that similar warming events have significantly impacted upon the reef’s coral. Research by the University of Queensland studied large Porites coral colonies, a type of coral considered more resistant than others to changes in the environment.  By analysing and dating coral samples, researchers found there was a significant correlation between mass coral mortality events and spikes in sea surface temperature over the past 150 years. This finding raises “serious concern” for the wellbeing of the Great Barrier Reef, the scientists said, because of the long-term threat of climate change and, more immediately, the arrival of El Niño. El Niño is a climate phenomenon, occurring every few years, when water in the western part of the Pacific Ocean becomes exceptionally warm. It has different impacts in different parts of the world but in Australia it is associated with warmer temperatures and increased risk of droughts. The chances of El Niño hitting this year has been measured at 90%; scientists are concerned it could cause widespread damage to the reef, which is already weakened because of pollution, cyclones and a plague of coral-eating starfish. It has suffered a number of coral bleaches, notably in 1997 and 1998, after an El Niño. Bleaching is where the coral loses life and colour and turns white and brittle. Professor Jian-xin Zhao, who led the University of Queensland project, said there has been a rise in Porites coral deaths in recent decades. “The 1997-98 bleaching followed a strong El Niño event on top of a decline in water quality and a long-term global warming trend, which seems to have pushed the most robust corals past their tolerance limit,” he said. “Considering that a similar El Niño event is predicted to occur this coming summer, we have grave concerns for the reef.” Dr Tara Clark, lead researcher, said the loss of delicate hard corals was a concern because they provided habitat for many fish species. “These Porites corals are meant to be robust, so for them to show a response to warming is significant,” she said. “We may have another bleaching event if there’s another El Niño, which would have dire consequences. “If we start losing types of hard coral we’ll see these environments completely change, which will have implications down the track for a range of fish species. “A stronger than normal El Niño event has been predicted, which is worthy of concern. But we should be focusing on things like pollution and overfishing, things we can control. If we can improve the water quality, it will buy us some time.”"

"Three distinct studies using four different methods have independently shown that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is 97 ± 1%. The result is the same whether we ask the experts’ opinions, look at their public reports and statements, or examine their peer-reviewed science. Even studies that quibble about the precise percentage have accidentally reinforced the 97 ± 1% consensus.  The evidence is crystal clear that humans are the main cause of the current global warming, and the expert consensus reflects the strength of that body of evidence. It’s not easy to convince 97% of scientific experts about anything – that requires some powerful scientific evidence.  And yet public opinion is a very different story. Americans think experts are evenly split on the causes of global warming. The public is likewise split on the cause of global warming, with just over half understanding that humans are primarily responsible. As a result, Americans don’t see global warming as an urgent issue, putting climate policy low on the list of priorities.  The sources of this disparity and how it can be corrected are the subjects of an intense debate amongst social scientists. One school of thought says that we have a problem with ‘information deficit’ as well as what climate scientist Michael Mann calls ‘misinformation surplus.’  For example, experimental evidence shows that if people are presented with a basic explanation of how global warming works, they’re more likely to accept the reality of human-caused global warming. Other research has shown that if people are told about the expert consensus, they’re also more likely to accept the science. In both cases, presenting people with certain pieces of information trims the gap between what the scientific evidence and experts say, and what the public believes.  The other school of thought, led by Dan Kahan at Yale, argues that the problem boils down to cultural biases. In essence, liberals feel as though they’re on Team ‘global warming is a problem caused by humans’ while conservatives identify with Team ‘no it’s not.’ Kahan feels that people will take any new information and pass it through their cultural filter; if it conforms to their cultural identity, they’ll accept it, or otherwise they’ll just reject it. In fact, Kahan argues that giving people information that doesn’t conform to their cultural identity (like the 97% consensus) may just act to polarize them further. In a recent editorial for The Guardian, Adam Corner made a similar argument, asking 'who cares about the climate change consensus?'. Corner suggested that climate information is ineffective if it’s not coming from “communicators whose cultural credentials are congruent with the audience they are speaking to.” Both Kahan and Corner have also argued that if consensus messaging could work, then it should have worked by now, whereas American public acceptance of human-caused global warming in 2014 is lower than in 2003. So if the ‘information deficit’ model is right, why hasn’t consensus messaging led to an increase in public acceptance of the science? Adam Corner identifies the problem in his Guardian piece. In response, 'merchants of doubt' have tried to muddy the waters by exaggerating scientific uncertainty. This is the ‘misinformation surplus’ that’s also been in play for several decades. For as long as the expert consensus on human-caused global warming has existed, there’s been a campaign to convince the public that the experts remain divided. This was articulated in a leaked 2002 memo from Republican political strategist Frank Luntz, which said, “Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming in the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate, and defer to scientists and other experts in the field.”  We don’t have a second America to use as a control group, but without the consensus messaging that’s happened over the past decade, my guess is that the public would be even more misinformed about global warming than it is now. The problem isn’t consensus messaging itself; the problem is that it’s fighting against a misinformation surplus. Another key point is that while ‘expert consensus’ is vague, ‘97% expert consensus’ is concrete and memorable (a.k.a. ‘sticky’ messaging). While Naomi Oreskes first identified the consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed literature in 2004, the first study to quantify it at 97% came in 2009, reinforced by 97% studies in 2010 and 2013. The above graph shows that the public became increasingly accepting of human-caused global warming during 2010–2014, so perhaps 97% consensus messaging is moving the dial after all. Most social scientists believe that both information deficit/misinformation surplus and cultural biases contribute to the problem. Research by John Cook supports this idea. He asked a representative sample of Americans across the political spectrum what percentage of scientific experts agree on human-caused global warming. Not surprisingly, the perceived consensus decreased from left to right across the political spectrum. However, even liberals believed the consensus is below 70%, in stark contrast to the actual 97%.  Cook calls this the 'liberal consensus gap.' Cultural filters can't explain it, because liberals are supposed to be on Team ‘global warming is a problem caused by humans.’ As the above figure indicates, the difference in perceived consensus between the left and right can be explained by Kahan's preferred cultural bias explanation, but the 'liberal consensus gap' can't. That's due to the information deficit/misinformation surplus. Both factors are partially responsible for public misconceptions about the causes of global warming. Another team of social scientists from George Mason and Yale Universities explained why the global warming consensus is important in a recent paper, ""...knowledge of the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change can be considered a “gateway” cognition; as members of the general public come to understand the consensus, they more likely come to the conclusion that human-caused climate change is happening and harmful."" Frank Luntz came to the same conclusion 12 years ago. It's why fossil fuel interests have been trying to sow doubt about the expert consensus on global warming for over two decades. So the 97% consensus message is important, and it's also important that this sort of information comes from sources that people trust within their own cultural groups. For example, President George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson recently wrote, ""I’ve spent a considerable amount of time with climate scientists and economists who have devoted their careers to this issue. There is virtually no debate among them that the planet is warming and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible ... The solution can be a fundamentally conservative one that will empower the marketplace to find the most efficient response. We can do this by putting a price on emissions of carbon dioxide — a carbon tax."" Four Republican former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency gave a similar message in testimony before the US Senate last week. To break through our current climate roadblocks, we need more of these examples that address both the information deficit and cultural biases. This can be achieved with informed messages (especially ""gateway"" information like the 97% consensus) coming from sources that conservatives can trust."
"Arctic migrants are nesting up to seven days earlier as the world warms. The sandpiper makes a beeline for the Alaskan shores, to join the phalarope on the beach and the songbirds in the woods − and all because the winter snows are melting earlier. Conservation scientists Joe Liebezeit and Steve Zack – both then of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) – and colleagues report in the journal Polar Biology that they looked into nearly 2,500 nests of four shorebird species in Alaska – two sandpipers, two phalaropes − and a songbird called the Lapland songspur over a nine-year period.  They recorded when the first eggs were laid. And they also assessed snow melt in nesting plots at different times in the early spring, and took note of predator abundance and the seasonal flush of vegetation − both of which can affect nest timing − to see what mattered most in terms of breeding. “It seems clear that the timing of the snow melt in Arctic Alaska is the most important mechanism driving the earlier and earlier breeding dates we observed in the Arctic,” said Liebezeit, now of the Audubon Society of Portland, Oregon. “The rates of advancement in earlier breeding are higher in Arctic birds than in other temperate bird species, and this accords with the fact that the Arctic climate is changing at twice the rate.” During the nine years in which the scientists conducted their study, they found that nesting advanced by between four and seven days. “Migratory birds are nesting earlier in the changing Arctic, presumably to track the earlier springs and abundance of insect pray,” said Steve Zack, who is the WCS co-ordinator of bird conservation. “Many of these birds winter in the tropics and may be compromising their complicated calendar of movements to accommodate this change. We’re concerned that there will be a threshold where they will no longer be able to track the emergence of these earlier springs, which may impact breeding success or even population viability.” The calendar of Arctic life is shaped by ice, and the ecology of the region is beginning to change as the area of sea covered by ice shrinks with successive summers. But Ingrid Onarheim, of the University of Bergen’s Geophysical Institute, and colleagues warn in the journal Tellus − published by the International Meteorological Institute at Stockholm University − that the Arctic ocean is losing ice even in winter, at least north of the island of Svalbard, Norway. A study of satellite records shows that this region is losing winter ice at the rate of almost 10% per decade, and the north Atlantic water that enters the Arctic ocean at this point has been warming at 0.3C per decade. At the same time, the surface air temperature has been warming at 2C per decade, and researchers have recorded an average rise in winter temperatures of 6.9C in the last 34 years. They believe that winds have not caused the long-term warming or loss of ice, so it must be warmer ocean temperatures pushing into the region west of Svalbard. The ice, furthermore, has thinned with the decades, making it more likely to melt and retreat with each succeeding winter."
"The news last week was awash with threats to global security: al-Qaida-sponsored stealth bombs; British jihadists fighting in Syria; and – least tangible, but perhaps most deadly of them all – antimicrobial resistance. Scientists have been sounding alarm bells about the inevitability of the evolution of disease-causing microbes to become resistant to drugs for decades. Global leaders are now taking heed, with the prime minister launching an independent expert review. The facts are stark. No new classes of antibiotic have been developed for 25 years: the pharmaceutical industry has focused on more lucrative types of drug development. Antimicrobial resistance is already estimated to cause 5,000 deaths a year in Britain and predictions for the future are frightening, with scientists forecasting that resistance could ultimately make any treatment that relies on suppressing our immune systems dangerous.  There are echoes here of the climate change challenge. Neither climate change nor antimicrobial resistance can be solved by nations acting alone. On the one hand, their scale is immense: disease and evolution do not respect national boundaries. The rate of depletion of the planet's natural resources affects the whole of humanity but no one country alone has the incentives to make the radical shifts needed. On the other, their scale is intensely human: their solution lies in hundreds of millions of people making small changes to their day-to-day behaviour. And in the case of both, developments in science and technology have a critical role to play. All of this means the typical responses that 20th-century developed nation states are used to taking to protect their populations stand defunct in the face of these super-challenges. There are important lessons to learn from climate change. First, it has illustrated the extent to which we lack the institutions capable of facilitating co-ordinated global action. World leaders are becoming more inward-facing as failed military interventions such as Iraq and Afghanistan have gradually eroded the postwar spirit of co-operation. Closer to home, the European Union is proving an easy scapegoat for many governments across Europe dealing with the popular backlash of an economic crash. Second, the limited progress made so far on climate change illustrates how little we know about how to change human behaviour. Advertisers have deployed sophisticated insights about how to tap into the human psyche to make money, but behavioural science is yet to be applied to protecting the planet. As the public seemingly ignores the calls to action of campaigners and scientists, there is a danger that they become ever shriller: let's tell people the truth of how awful it is to shock them into action. Yet this switches people off rather than motivating them to act. Last, climate change has taught us that science is not intrinsically benevolent. It has delivered innovations that have transformed humanity. But these have not emerged from a private sector putting security and enlightenment before profit, but as a result of a public-private partnership involving significant state investment. Advancements in low-carbon tech have been constrained by industry's perception of limited profits; likewise, drug companies will not invest in antibiotics unless they see benefits for shareholders. The government's investment in pharma has failed to address this; instead, policies such as the Patent Box, introduced in the face of heavy lobbying from industry, have subsidised investment that would have been made anyway. There are some reasons for optimism, though. The science around antimicrobial resistance is less contested than that of climate change, and the laissez-faire assumption that the state has no place intervening in innovation is being challenged, post the banking crisis. Antimicrobial resistance will affect rich and poor countries alike, unlike the effects of climate change, concentrated on some of the poorest parts of the world, which may make co-operation easier. David Cameron is to be commended for taking a lead on this globally. But there is a danger that the review ends up a weighty tome gathering dust on a shelf next to the 2006 Stern review on climate change. The war on disease cannot be fought with an expert report: it will require real action from governments around the world to build international alliances, engage with behavioural science and rethink their relationships with the pharmaceutical industry."
"“Don’t shoot the messenger,” so the saying goes. But what if that message warns we might want to rethink that whole fossil fuel burning thing pretty quick because it could seriously alter civilization and the natural world for centuries to come, and not in a good way?  Time to get the bullets out and start firing, obviously. Climate scientists have been trying to dodge, catch or deflect those bullets for decades.  They are now all too used to being shot at, kicked and maligned as their findings are misunderstood, misrepresented, trivialised or booted around like footballs between politicians and other warring ideological factions and self-interested industry groups. But if they had to pick one thing, what is it that really gets them annoyed? When the public tries to understand the implications of their scientific findings – or just understand the findings themselves – what’s the most common mistake they see? When the media gets hold of their findings, what makes climate scientists chuck a shoe, ice core or physics textbook at the screen in frustration? I decided to ask a few leading climate scientists from around the globe to articulate that one thing that leaves them totally tacked off. Some struggled to pick only a single bugbear (one even called to apologise for taking too long, so spoilt for choice were they), others took the chance to uncompromisingly unload their frustrations. Here’s what they had to say.  Many people who would not dream to claim they understand how antibiotics, microprocessors or immunisations work seem happy to wax lyrical on their views on climate change.  A politician or media identity who would be laughed out of office if they said “vaccines don't work"" or “I am certain the moon is made of cheese"" happily speak equivalent rubbish on climate science, believing their views deserve credit.  I want engineers to build bridges; I want a trained surgeon to operate on hearts and I want some of our decision-makers and commentators to either shut up, or familiarise themselves with climate science well enough to talk sense. If there’s one concept that is typically misrepresented in the public discourse on climate change, it is the concept of uncertainty. There are uncertainties in model projections of future climate change. However, these uncertainties cut both ways, and in many cases it appears that model projections have underestimated the rate and magnitude of the climate changes resulting from our burning of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The rapid lost of Arctic sea ice is one such example.  Rather than being cause for inaction, uncertainty is a reason to act all the sooner. The greatest cause for sorrow is the widespread inability of the public discussion to recognise the whole picture.  Much of the political discourse reduces the complexities of climate change to political football (“axe the tax”); much media reporting sees only the hook to today’s passing story; many interest groups want to use climate change to proselytise for their particular get-out-of-jail free card (nuclear power, carbon farming).  All of this misses or trivialises the real, systemic significance of climate change: that humankind is encountering the finitude of our planet, confronting the need to share and protect our endowment from nature, and realising that much will have to change to make this possible. The thing that bugs me most about the way climate change is talked about in the media is journalists citing scientific papers without providing a link to the original paper.  Readers often want to get more details or simply check sources, but this is very difficult (or sometimes impossible) if the source is not given. I've raised this a few times, and get lame excuses like 'readers get frustrated when the journals are paywalled' but that's not good enough. Media should provide sources – end of. Where to start? These are things I don’t see (or don’t see enough).  First is still that, even though it is clear greenhouse gas emissions raise the temperature of the Earth, we’ve known this for 50+ years and no reputable atmospheric scientist in the world disputes this, most people think scientists disagree. They’ve been misled by the media, and I’ve been told repeatedly by reporters in the US and Australia that this is due to pressure from management. Second is the fact that carbon dioxide emissions are effectively irreversible and will stay in the climate system for hundreds of generations is seldom noted. If we decide later that this was a huge mistake there is no going back (practically speaking). On the political side, I wish the media would note the obvious parallels of the carbon debate with past ones over restricting pollutants (mercury, lead, asbestos, CFCs), where claims that restrictions would be economically catastrophic never came true. These are things I do see that bug me.  One would be phrases like “action on climate change”. We should be talking about “action on carbon dioxide” — and climate is only one reason (albeit the biggest) that too much of it is dangerous. Nothing we do with respect to any other influence on climate will prevent global warming if CO2 keeps climbing. One of the phrases that makes me cringe is when I read in the media that a particular extreme weather event ""is no evidence for climate change"". This is so bad it's not even wrong, but it is quite misleading.  Climate change is a measured fact seen in rising temperatures, vanishing ice, rising sea levels etc. - it needs no further evidence. And a single extreme event cannot possibly provide such evidence, because climate change increases the number of certain extremes. Some, like heat waves, have already increased massively thanks to global warming. Who am I? I can be sued for calling a public individual fraudulent but not a whole scientific community or organisation – because climate scientists and the IPCC are fraudulent. I can publish proven lies in my newspaper day after day with no penalty. I can buy disaffected scientists to deny sound science with a plane fare to a bogus conference and a little publicity. I can anonymously threaten researchers online, especially the female ones.  If anyone threatens me with facts, I can call them an antidemocratic, anti-jobs, McCarthyist, communist, anti-freedom, pagan environmentalist. Everyone says there is no consensus. I deny everything. I get annoyed when I hear yet another politician arguing that we can’t link extreme events to climate change. You know the spurious reasoning? Australia’s always had heatwaves/floods/fires, so this recent extreme is nothing to worry about. When I hear this, it’s time to turn off the TV. Climate scientists don’t just guess at what contributed to recent extremes. We methodically calculate changes in the risk of extremes due to human factors, like greenhouse gases. I don’t just get irate out of principle.  Dismissing the link between climate change and extremes as hogwash leaves us vulnerable to a warmer climate. I think the scale of the changes being seen now when compared to the Earth's history is something the media and the public do not appreciate. Earth's history is marked by a number of major mass extinctions of species, triggered by volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts and release of methane from sediments.  Major shifts in the state of the climate were caused either by pulsations in solar radiation or by release of carbon from the Earth. In each of these events a marked rise occurred in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  As the level of energy and temperature of the atmosphere increased, irreversible tipping points were reached where the synergy of feedback processes – ice melt, warming water, released methane, droughts and fires - combined to shift the climate from one state to the next.  The current rise in energy of the atmosphere above that of pre-industrial times, by about 3 Watt per square meter, is about half that of the atmospheric energy rise during the last transition from glacial to interglacial state.  The current shift is threatening to bring about irreversible tipping points in the climate, with the most serious consequences, likely indicated by the increase over the last 20 years or so in the intensity of extreme weather events around the globe.  The current rise of atmospheric CO2 at a rate of near-three parts per million per year exceeds rates recorded in the history of the atmosphere for the last 55 million years, which retards the ability of species to adapt to environmental change in time. A consequent shift from conditions, which have allowed agriculture to take place from about 8,000 years ago, would render large parts of the continents unsuitable for cultivation."

"The difference between the position of the Australian and the United States governments on climate change looks stark. Last week members of the Australian government celebrated the passing of a bill dismantling the carbon price, while last Wednesday US president Barack Obama delivered a speech arguing strongly for the need to act on climate change. Obama’s speech came off the back of the announcement earlier in the month that the US Environmental Protection Authority was proposing new rules to force the power sector to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030.  Last week as well, a new report on the economic impacts of climate change was issued by a bipartisan organisation headed by the “Risky Business project”, which is co-chaired by former republican mayor of New York city Michael R. Bloomberg; Henry Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs and the secretary of the treasury under George W Bush; and Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge-fund manager with a long history of environmental philanthropy. The Risky Business project seeks to look at the impact of climate change on the US from an economic perspective. It is not the first climate change report to take this approach. The Stern Review issued in 2006 examined the impact of climate change on the world economy. The Risky Business report, however, looks purely at the US and argues that the response to climate change is essentially about mitigating risk.  Again this approach is not new. Even Rupert Murdoch’s essentially fatuous remark that “we should give the planet the benefit of the doubt” was based on risk management. In 1990 Margaret Thatcher was arguing much the same. But the Risky Business report takes this approach a step further than other such reports by using econometric and climate change modelling to forecast the impact of climate change at a regional level of detail. And rather than talk just about increasing in temperatures in these regions, it talks about the impact of those temperatures on people’s livelihoods. While the sole focus on the US and its specific regions may seem like typical American insularity, it is more about acknowledging that all politics is local. As Upton Sinclair noted, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” And if that person is a corn farmer in Iowa, telling him about the impact of climate change on the Pacific Islands is unlikely to do the trick (important though it is). President Obama noted the need to address this aspect in his speech, saying, “People don’t like gas prices going up. They don’t like electricity prices going up. And we ignore those very real and legitimate concerns at our peril, so if we’re blithe about saying this is the defining issue of our time but we don’t address people’s legitimate economic concerns, then even if they are concerned about climate change they may not support efforts to do something about it.” The Risky Business report addresses these impact by noting the increase in temperatures across the continental US under various scenarios: But it notes that these increased temperatures will drive an increase in electricity consumption owing to more people using air conditioners more often. The report argues that higher peak demand for electricity “will likely require the construction of up to 95 GW of additional power generation capacity over the next five to 25 years, the rough equivalent of 200 average-size coal or natural gas power plants”. It argues “constructing these new power-generation facilities will, in turn, raise residential and commercial energy prices”. Thus, “climate-driven changes in heating and cooling will likely increase annual residential and commercial energy costs nationally by $474m to $12bn over the next five to 25 years and $8.5bn to $30bn by the middle of the century.” The report also notes the impact of the increased temperatures on industry – with an especially harsh impact on crop yields. It asserts that some states “like Missouri and Illinois, face up to a 15% likely average yield loss in the next five to 25 years, and up to a 73% likely average yield loss by the end of the century”. It also forecasts the humid heat stroke index (HHSI) in each region. The index measures the point at which people who work outdoors would be unable to do so without significant risk to health and potential death. The report notes that “the only place in the world that has ever reached the unbearable HHSI of 95°F (37C) was Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 2003. At the time, the outside temperature was 101°F (38.5C) and the dew point was 90°F (32C)”. But such temperatures are headed to the US midwest. It forecasts that on the current path of temperature rises “the average midwesterner could see an HHSI at the dangerous level of 95°F two days every year by late century, and that by the middle of the next century she or he can expect to experience 20 full days in a typical year of HHSI over 95°F”. But American climate change politics does have one similarity with Australia – the opposition to it. Republicans in congress reacted to the EPA’s new rules by suggesting the Obama administration was waging a “war on coal” and they were likely to try and block the new rules. Economist Paul Krugman responded to Henry Paulson’s op-ed in the New York Times launching the Risky Business report by noting that the Republican party which “respects science and is willing to consider even market-friendly government interventions like carbon taxes, no longer exists”. Given our government has dismantled a carbon tax, during which time Australia’s economy grew among the fastest of all OECD nations, Krugman’s comment might just as well be targeted at the Liberal party: At least with reports like Risky Business politicians the world over have pretty much run out of the excuse of saying they weren’t aware of the risks."
"What inspired you to live more sustainably, and to write about it?Josh: I think there's a sort of background radiation of environmental awareness that has been building up over our lifetimes, so if you're open to that you look for opportunities to be more sustainable. But there have been specific influences. I worked in carbon reduction policy for a few years, and that increased our awareness of climate change issues. More recently, we've been influenced by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's campaigns and his writing on animal welfare and sustainable fishing. I think some credit should also go to our parents, particularly in modelling the build-it-yourself, grow-it-yourself way of life.Becky: I find inspiration in the many amazing things people are already doing. When we were younger, Fairtrade was a new and exciting idea, now Fairtrade sugar is the standard sugar available in the supermarkets and the range of products is huge. That is a great achievement, and seeing that sort of success is really inspiring and makes me think about what I can do in my own life. I wanted to keep all our friends up to date with our news when we moved to Derbyshire, firstly. But more importantly I'd felt for a while that I spent a lot of time hanging around on the internet, reading other people's blogs and passively consuming information without giving much back. I decided I wanted to create as well as consume and add something to the conversation more than just posting a few comments or pressing the ""like"" button. What changes have you made to live a greener lifestyle?Josh: We've gradually shifted our lifestyle over time. Back in London we were cycling to the train station, growing our own veg on a small scale, composting our food waste. We reduced the amount of meat and fish in our diet, too, and cut down on holidays that would require us to fly. But the big changes have happened since we moved to Chesterfield. We've more than doubled the amount of fruit and veg we can grow, as well as making the big and slightly scary step of keeping our own pigs in our orchard. Because this felt like more of a permanent home for us, we felt confident enough to get solar panels on our roof. And we've had a baby, so things like cloth nappies rather than mountains of disposables going to landfill have become part of the picture.Becky: We are far from perfect but we do try and look at everything we buy to work out the most sustainable option. This might involve research, looking for something secondhand or simply double-checking our shopping basket in the supermarket. There are lots of little decisions you can make as a consumer every day which I see as little opportunities for sustainability; if you miss one there will be another one tomorrow. We source a lot of our meat from the pigs we keep ourselves or small local producers we know. We don't buy any meat from supermarkets anymore or anyone who can't tell us how the animal was kept. It is more expensive that way so we just eat less meat and make the most of what we do buy.What have you learned along the way?Becky: We have learned a lot of practical skills to help support a more sustainable life such as cooking, preserving, vegetable gardening, caring for animals, as well as DIY and mending. Living sustainably means learning about the chains of production and consumption, learning not to ignore the issues you find there, working out what action you can take (and afford!) that works for you. Doing it yourself means you know exactly how something was produced and is the ultimate way, I think, to take responsibility. There is a huge pleasure in gaining skills, using them and getting compliments from other people on the work you have done.  Josh: I've particularly found myself getting to grips with a lot of DIY that I'd previously not really bothered with. Things like building a pig ark, constructing a composter, or more familiar stuff like replacing the valve on a radiator for a more energy-efficient one. You surprise yourself with what you can manage to do. What are some of your favourite things about living sustainably and blogging about it?  Becky: When I look in the cupboard and see a shelf full of jam that I've made from fruit grown in our garden I get an incredibly happy feeling just knowing I've accomplished it. When I can share that produce with friends and family it is even more satisfying. One of the great things about having the blog is that when I find a practical solution to a sustainability problem – no matter how small it seems – I can share it; share the skills, share the knowledge and perhaps get other people doing it too.  How has your family reacted to the changes you've made? Becky: Our families have been really positive and supportive about the change; possibly even a little jealous in some cases! As we were growing up both my parents and Josh's parents made their own wine, preserves and cooked everything from scratch. Josh's parents kept and bred chickens for meat and eggs when he was a child, and my parents keep chickens for eggs now. Watching us carve out this dream for ourselves and our son has seemed very familiar to them. When our first pork returned from the butchers, my family visited for the weekend to help make sausages and Parma ham, ensuring we used every last piece of that precious meat. In return we have really enjoyed being able to share the food we grow with them. My Dad and I can talk for hours about growing vegetables and raising animals. Josh: We get a lot of help and support from the family, too. They're old hands at the DIY and gardening jobs that we find a bit daunting, so there's always helpful advice on hand if we need it. Not to mention quite a lot of our gardening equipment being donated or loaned by them, and time spent helping us with the actual legwork. What encourages you to keep living sustainably Becky: Every day we uncover something horrifying about the food chain or the clothing chain or some other consumable. The recent Guardian article on slavery in the prawn trade is a good example. Up until that point I'd been happy thinking that prawns were a fairly sustainable option, now we are having to rethink that. Since having our son, I've become even more aware of sustainable living. It is a terrible cliche – to wonder what sort of world he will be inheriting – but I do worry and I want to show him how to make good choices in a world full of bad options. Josh: It's also worth saying that we save a fair bit of money doing things sustainably. Buying cloth nappies for our son cost a fair bit up-front but it can save you hundreds of pounds over the years. But I think doing the right thing is what drives us forward. Everyone's now aware of climate change, the amount of stuff we waste, the way many of our goods are built on the backs of cheap labour elsewhere in the world ... nobody can really claim not to know about these things. Once you know about it, you want to do your best not to be part of the problem. Becky and Josh blog here.

"Slashed flood defence budgets have left the nation at the mercy of the wilder weather that climate change is bringing, according to the outgoing chair of the Environment Agency. Lord Chris Smith, who steps down in July after a sometimes stormy six-year stint, said reduced funds and rising risks were an “inconvenient truth” and that failing to improve flood protection in the face of more frequent and extreme events was a false economy.  In an interview with the Guardian, he also said: • the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, does not accept that global warming is due to the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning; • the government has failed to fulfil David Cameron’s pledge to be the “greenest ever”; • the current resources available to regulate fracking safely could not cope with the government’s hoped-for shale gas boom; • major budget cuts at the Environment Agency (EA) have cut action against the illegal dumping of waste. The severe and prolonged winter flooding saw heavy criticism of Smith and the EA, despite the agency having to deal with cuts to annual flood defence budgets of 25% after the coalition took power, meaning that hundreds of schemes did not go ahead. Smith called Eric Pickles’s attack on EA expertise “unforgivable” but praised Paterson. “He certainly did a good job on supporting the EA through the flooding emergency, even to the extent that he was sending me texts from his hospital bed [after a detached retina]. I take my hat off to him.” But Smith said the extra £270m provided by government after the winter floods would only repair the damage suffered by many flood defences. “What we won’t be able to do is cope with all the added dangers that climate change will bring,” he said. A “classic example”, he said, was a £250m scheme to protect lower Thames from Windsor to Teddington. “This is an area of very substantial flood risk, as we saw during the winter. But at the moment the money is not on the table.” Smith also attacked the failure of ministers to restore funding to maintain existing defences. “My most important message is maintenance, maintenance, maintenance: that is every bit as important as building new schemes.” He said: “Any cuts to flood defence spending is of course a false economy because, as we face the increased prospect of flooding happening more frequently in more extreme forms, we need to be protecting not just people’s homes but we need to be protecting our economy. We are constantly making this case to the Treasury.” He said flood defences were the most cost effective public infrastructure investments, saving £8 in damages for every £1 spent. An exception, he noted, was the controversial dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels, which provided less value for money. On Paterson, who cut funding for adapting to climate change in the UK by almost half, Smith said: “He recognises weather patterns are changing and that something is happening to the climate. But he doesn’t necessarily accept that it’s down to the CO2 we are throwing into the atmosphere. I wish he had a better view on that.” The EA is responsible for the environmental safety of fracking and, in 2013, Smith was summoned by Paterson to resolve a dispute over the regulation of shale gas with fracking company boss Lord John Browne. Smith said on Thursday: ”Our firm view is that existing regulations are adequate to ensure that fracking operations happen safely. At the moment we have the resources, for the current level of applications, which of course are relatively small.” But he said the government is “extremely keen” on fracking and a fracking boom would require more money to be provided to ensure the environmental safety of fracking. Smith said the EA budget cuts, including thousands of job losses, had been painful. But he said efficiency measures – leading to back-office costs falling 33% less – had made it a better organisation. The biggest impacts outside flood defences would be on fighting the criminal dumping of waste, he said: “Illegal waste sites can be extremely offensive and nasty for local communities, but I am afraid we will be able to do less of that.” It was “really disappointing” that Cameron’s government had failed to deliver the “greenest government ever”, said Smith, a former Labour cabinet minister. “The environment is the most important long-term issue we face,” he said, adding that politicians underestimated people’s passion for the environment, particularly in their local areas. “There is a fundamental regard for, respect for and love for the environment amongst people. Politicians ought to be seizing onto that.” Friends of the Earth’s Andrew Pendleton said: “Smith is quite right – politicians need to be honest with people because they’ve known for years that climate change will have a devastating impact on the UK, with worse flooding and damage to coastlines and crops. To have an environment secretary who disputes man-made climate change is simply ludicrous. As a first step, David Cameron must give Owen Paterson the boot as soon as possible.”"
"The US president, Barack Obama, has praised New Zealand prime minister John Key as a key ally in his crusade to tackle climate change. While Australia may have dropped off as a partner with the election of Tony Abbott as prime minister, Obama says the US and New Zealand will work closely together ahead of next year's climate change conference in Paris, where the world's first global agreement could be hammered out.  The Kiwi prime minister visited the White House on Friday, a little over a week after Abbott met the president in the Oval Office. Obama and Key were so cosy the president announced he would visit New Zealand, possibly later this year. ""I would love to come to New Zealand because I hear it is really nice,"" Obama said. ""I know the people are nice because I've had a chance to meet them. We are going to be working with my schedule to see what I can come up with, if not this year, but certainly before the end of my presidency."" Obama and Key discussed a range of issues, including the ongoing negotiations for the 12-nation trade Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), North Korea, China and the world economy. On the environment, Obama said the two nations would robustly work together ahead of Paris. ""We had a good conversation about climate change where New Zealand has been an excellent partner with us and other economies recognising that this is a threat that none of us can solve individually and we are going to have to work on together,"" Obama said. ""So we discussed our plans for putting forward robust action in 2015 with the upcoming Paris conference."" Key made headlines at a US Chamber of Commerce event in Washington DC on Thursday when he said Japan should be cut out of the TPP trade talks if it doesn't open up its markets to more farm imports. Other potential TPP members are Australia, Canada, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, Chile, Brunei, Vietnam and Mexico. Obama had made a deadline for the TPP to be negotiated by the end of 2013, but now he hopes to have a deal close to being signed in November. ""We discussed a timeline where by before the end of the year we are able to get a document that can create jobs both in New Zealand and the United States and the other countries that are participating and expand wealth for all parties concerned,"" Obama said. ""Our hope is by the time we see each other again in November, when I travel to Asia, we should have something that we have consulted with Congress about, that the public can take a look at and we can make a forceable argument to go ahead and close the deal. ""But, we have a lot of work to do between now and then."" Key was also upbeat. ""New Zealand and the United States have been the two partners, I think, in the Trans Pacific Partnership who have always believed in a high-quality, comprehensive deal,"" Key said."
"Cities are home to half the world's population and produce a staggering 80% of global GDP. As more of us continue to migrate to cities, these numbers are widely expected to grow. According to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), urban climate change risks are increasing too. We are already witnessing the consequences of this. Last winter's historic flooding in England wreaked havoc on homes and businesses, costing small businesses alone some £830m and counting. Now, the UK Committee on Climate Change has issued fresh warnings that not planning for climate change will result in significant costs for the UK government. However, it also showed that investing in resilience pays: for every £1 spent on flood defence, £8 is saved.  City governments too are aware of the potential financial impacts of climate change. Protecting our Capital (pdf) is a new report that illustrates city governments are protecting their economies, businesses and communities. The analysis, based on environmental risk information provided by the world's leading cities and from companies within them, shows that where cities have identified risks recognised by businesses, they are taking adaptation and mitigation actions to combat them. Water features heavily as one of the primary physical threats disclosed to CDP by both companies and cities. This includes risks such as storms, flooding, sea level rise and frequent and intense rainfall. Copenhagen, for example, describes flooding as an ""instantaneous"" event that negatively impacts business operations due to road closures and damage to buildings. And while the impacts of sea level rises can be immediate, notes Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, they have ""lasting impacts"" on tourism and supply chains. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) states that more than $3tn in assets is at risk from climate change in port cities, which are vital gateways for the exchange of goods and services. Given that water-related risks pose such a significant threat to economic activity in urban centres, climate change has created a new imperative for greater public-private partnerships. In São Paulo — the largest city by population in the whole of the southern hemisphere — the problems of storm-related flooding and poor sanitation have negatively affected its most vulnerable slum communities. Sabesp, the largest water company in Brazil, which is part-owned by the state, is working with the city on a $600m programme to provide sewage networks that will improve the water infrastructure and sanitation in 43 slums. Cities in coastal Asia, are, according to the IPCC, expected to face some of the worst effects of climate change in the first half of this century. Cities and companies alike are adapting in response. Hong Kong's drainage services department is investing $2.7bn in flood defence infrastructure, including underground storage tanks, river widening and large drainage tunnels. Meanwhile, energy supplier CLP Holdings, one of two energy suppliers in Hong Kong, has also moved to protect against sea level rise by raising the floor levels of buildings that house critical infrastructure. City governments aren't focused exclusively on improvements to infrastructure in this context. From Las Vegas to Addis Ababa, raising awareness and providing information around physical water-related climate risks is a key strategy for city governments to improve resilience. In Las Vegas, the Southern Nevada Water Authority has, together with local municipalities, reduced the community's water consumption by 36bn gallons through conservation programmes — that's equivalent to 20 hours of water flow over Niagara Falls. In London the mayor has published a water strategy that informs and encourages the city's four privatised water companies to improve water-efficiency and better manage water resources. While cities are working on myriad solutions to improve and build their climate resilience, from investing in green infrastructure to establishing alternative sources of clean drinking water, the burden is not theirs alone. Our report shows that cities are recognising the benefits of climate mitigation and adaptation but that companies too must respond to these risks. In many cases city action has obvious co-benefits for others. Coordinated action between cities and the private sector, be it through sharing information or better planning, is however key if the significant climate threat to our economies and ecosystems is to be avoided.

"Consumers, stand by to feel increasingly uplifted and guilt-free! The foremost means of ""empowering global consumers"", The Global Consumer Goods Forum, took place in Paris last week, convening 1,000 ""c-suite executives"" (those with ""chief"" in their acronym) including 400 of the world's top CEOs. Gatherings where global heads of snack development engage with emeritus professors of agricultural science on topics such as ""creative capitalism"" are increasingly common but the forum is the biggie. Every retailer and manufacturer wants to be seen and heard there.  This summit yielded innovations the planet can arguably do without (drones for crisp delivery?) and some it urgently needs. By the end of play on Friday, the consumer goods behemoths had committed to zero net deforestation by 2020 through the reform of supply chains, phasing out hydro fluorocarbons from refrigeration by 2015, ending junk food ads aimed at under-12s by 2018 and called for a binding global climate deal ahead of international talks next year. To anyone who subscribes to Milton Friedman's view that ""the only responsibility of business is to increase its profits"", this is business overstepping its brief by some margin. Boring old corporate social responsibility has turned into a muscular version of values-led capitalism, filling a political vacuum. ""If hundreds of the world's most powerful companies can agree to get behind an ambitious call for any type of political action, world leaders should pay attention,"" said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International. If you're struggling to connect the selling of ice cream with ending global poverty, think of the mouth-watering opportunity these brands have to transform markets. The top 400 consumer goods companies (Proctor & Gamble leads, followed by Unilever) have combined sales of €2.5tn, employing 10 million people directly and 90 million others along highly complex supply chains. A shift from unsustainable sourcing in a commodity, such as palm oil, to sustainable should mean a shift in fortunes for the biosphere. Without such a shift, the consequences are unthinkable. According to Oxfam's recent report, Standing on the Sidelines, by 2050 there could be an extra 25 million malnourished children aged under five and 50 million more people going hungry. The report says that the Big 10 food companies (including Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever), which emit more greenhouse gas emissions than Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway combined through their supply chains, must act now. Mixed into this is the cult of the ""hero"" CEO. Paul Polman, the head of Unilever, pitches the company as values- rather than profit- driven and has taken a stand against both mindless consumption and quarterly reporting. Crucially, when it comes to encouraging other companies with limited interest in altruism to follow suit, he has ended a ""decade of stagnant turnover"". Therein lies the rub. The system is still undeniably based on selling more stuff very fast – increasingly to emerging markets – and that involves exporting an unsustainable, fast-paced form of consumerism. Let's not forget the usual prefix of the ""consumer goods"" sector is ""fast moving"". Steadier, more sustainable models of consumption based on hiring, loaning and reuse are sometimes talked about, but aren't making a dent. It remains to be proved that we can have our sustainable cake and eat it."
"The cane toad has found its ideal niche in Australia, with the invasive species set to continue its onward march further into New South Wales and Western Australia, scientists have warned. A new report, led by the University of Melbourne, looked at how cane toads fitted into “niche theory”, which dictates how suited an animal species is to an area based on its environment and interaction with other species.  Researchers found that cane toads filled a wide fundamental niche in Australia, as opposed to the narrow, tightly defined role they have in their native South America.  This means that the toads, which have been blamed for the destruction of native wildlife as they spread across northern Australia, have been able to “colonise” the landscape, largely owing to the lack of natural predators. In South America, cane toads co-evolved with other toads, while other species developed that prey upon the animals, but these restraints are not in place in Australia. “Australia has been good to the toads climatically and also in terms of a lack of predators,” Reid Tingley, lead researcher at the University of Melbourne told Guardian Australia. “In South America, there will be other animals similar to a quoll which would have preyed upon the toads for millions of years. But without that evolutionary history here, Australian animals think it is a native toad, attack it and die.” Cane toads were introduced to Queensland in the 1930s as a way of controlling crop pests but instead gorged themselves on other local wildlife and spread across northern Australia to Western Australia. The species, which reproduces in huge numbers, has been blamed for the deaths of native animals such as snakes and quolls. As these animals attempt to eat the toads, toxins within the supposed prey poison and kill the predators.  Tingley said the toads would continue their march across WA while a group that has become established near Sydney airport will eventually link up with toads pushing south into NSW. A separate report into the spread of tropical areas released on Monday predicts that cane toads, as well as creatures such as crocodiles, will become more populous in southern parts of Australia owing to climate change. The tropics are expected to expand by about 200km every 25 years because of rising temperatures. “Any sort of increase in tropical area will be a good thing for toads,” Tingley said. “If there are future increases in temperature, that will increase their range south, but there will be other considerations too. For example, toads depend upon precipitation and it generally only rains in Perth when it is cold.” Researchers are working on a way to stop the spread of toads in WA. While the toads are likely to surge across the Kimberley, it’s hoped they may be stopped when they reach Broome. “It’s likely they will hit Broome in the next 10 years or so,” Tingley said. “They will be met with a very narrow strip of suitable habitat, due to the fact they need water all year round. Toads have little chance of survival if they go 10 days or so without sitting in water. “The idea is that if we work with pastoralists, rangers and environmental groups, we could restrict the toads’ access to bodies of water, thereby stopping their spread. We could remove water spots in favour of tanks of water that don’t leak, essentially creating a waterless ‘firebreak’ to stop their spread.”"

"Heating of the oceans is, pardon the pun, a hot subject. There is a broad recognition that the oceans, which absorb approximately 90% of excess greenhouse gas energy, are key not only to how fast the planet will warm, but also how hot it will get in the end. Many recent studies have tried to measure deeper ocean regions or previously uncharted areas in the search for heat. A new study by Lijing Cheng and Jiang Zhu takes a different approach. They ask how large are biases in the estimates of ocean heating from the finite resolution of the devices themselves. Their findings are exciting, but first, let’s talk about the details of the study.  Measuring the oceans is difficult; they are vast and deep. In order to measure the total energy in the ocean, you have to obtain temperatures at many locations and at many depths. Not only that, you need to make measurements over many years if you want to identify long-term trends. Oceanographers have been making such measurements for decades. But the density of measurements is not spread uniformly over the oceans. There are more in coastal regions or major shipping lanes than in other locations. To further complicate the problem, the measurement methods have changed over the years.  Decades ago, insulated buckets, then, bathythermograph devices, and now ARGO floats have been used. While these devices all go down into the ocean depths, they have different depth resolutions. Over the years, we have a large number of measurements near ocean’s surfaces but as we measure deeper and deeper, fewer and fewer data points are available. As a result, we cannot construct exact temperature-depth curves. Consequently, our discrete data points give us some error, some bias compared to real ocean temperatures. In their paper, Lijing Cheng and Jiang Zhu quantify our ocean errors. They started with a “real” ocean temperature and then they extracted discrete data and asked themselves how their discrete data matched the original temperatures. By discrete data, I mean that they extracted temperatures every 10 meters, 20 meters, 30 meters, and so forth. Somewhat like the science of calculus where smooth curves are approximated by a series of straight-lined segments. What they found was very interesting. In the upper regions of the oceans, the discrete data was colder than the real ocean temperatures. However, deeper in the waters, the trend reversed and the discrete data was warmer. But to make things more complicated, the errors differed depending on location in the oceans. Near the equator (tropics), the discrete data exhibited a warm bias but further from the equator, the bias was cold. Furthermore, the extent of the error changed throughout the year. The authors use their findings to calculate how close together measurements would have to be to obtain accurate ocean temperature measurements. The authors also propose a method to correct past temperature data to account for these biases. It is important for readers to recognize that the biases themselves do not make us think climate change will be worse or milder. What really matter are the changes to biases over time.  Dr. Cheng, who recently graduated with his PhD, told me, “Ocean heat content is one of the key climate indicators. The latest IPCC report lists upper ocean heating (upper 700 meters of ocean water) that range widely among researchers. Diagnosing the sources of uncertainty in upper ocean heat content is an important task for the scientific community and the general public. I first proposed a method to examine expendable bathythermograph biases. We worked on a cooperative research effort with colleagues Tim Boyer from NOAA, and Susan Wijffels and Rebecca Crowley from CSIRO to diagnose new measurement correction schemes. This could help oceanographers obtain unbiased ocean temperatures for climate studies. We noticed that the resolution of measurements is sparse. We wanted to know whether the insufficiency in resolution could cause errors in ocean heating estimates. We assessed this problem in our paper and we are now working on improving ocean warming estimates.” Since this topic is one I’ve published on recently, I will be awaiting the next installment from this research team with bated breath. "
"What might be considered one of the greenest energy sources with the highest potential - solar parks - pose new environmental questions, potential threats and untapped benefits. The construction of solar photovoltaics (PV) is growing at an unprecedented rate globally, expanding by 50% per year over the last decade, reaching almost 100 terawatt-hours (twh) in 2012. The growth is set to continue with the European Photovoltaic Industry Association predicting that solar PV could provide between 7% and 11% of European electricity demand by 2030 and the International Energy Association that 690GW capacity will be installed across the world by 2035.  This rise in solar PV is driven by governments, and businesses, chasing targets for low carbon energy. Government support programmes and subsidies have helped the growth of solar PV, including major additions in Germany, Italy, China, US, Japan and India. Generation costs are becoming comparable to retail electricity prices, and in some places solar PV may become competitive to the average wholesale electricity prices. Solar is already a giant rolling stone. The problem is the scale of land involved, and the change of land use. The energy density - the amount of land required to produce wattage - of PV is relatively low. But, according to the US Department of Energy, to hit the 2035 target of 690 GW capacity of PV, we would need 6,900 to 34,500 sq km. In environmental terms, building-mounted is the greenest approach, but more complex and costly than ground-mounted systems. Solar PV parks are generally built on brownfield sites or agricultural land, and policies usually dictate that only low-grade agricultural land can be used. Ground-mounted solar panels have been constructed throughout the world, including the UK, US, India, China, Spain, France, Abu Dhabi and Australia. The split between building- and ground-mounted systems varies, for example ground-mounted systems constituted 82% of solar PV capacity in China and around 45% across Europe in 2011. Climate is a known and powerful factor in changing the nature of soil and the relationship with plants that can grow there. Research carried out so far into both wind farms and solar parks suggests that these types of changes in land-use could result in micro-climate changes. Work on wind farm sites, for example, has highlighted local effects on temperatures, changed humidity levels through turbulence, higher concentrations of biogenic gas (CO2, methane and nitrous oxide), and changes in patterns of cloud cover and rainfall. It's clear that PV panels will cause shading and changes to wind flow, and in principle is likely to alter temperature, change the rainfall distribution (which impacts on soil moisture) and the wind flow over the land. But we just don't know enough about what happens to the soil, plants and wildlife in areas where ground mounted PV parks are constructed. The phenomenon is still a new one and rapid development is taking place on the basis of ignorance. But the effect the PV panels have on the local climate and what impact this has on the plants and soil is very important. Soil is the most significant player in storing carbon - containing more than vegetation and the atmosphere combined - and the interaction between soil and plants regulates carbon storage and the release of greenhouse gases. So the expansion of solar parks matter for the carbon cycle, the growth rate of plants, the amount of carbon locked up in the soil, the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and the types of species that can live in the new conditions. Mass use of solar farms over time will increase the areas affected and the scale of the new phenomenon. Once the effects on the environment are better known we will be able to design the next generation of solar PV parks that move beyond maximum energy production to ways of combining land use. In the UK, combining solar with grazing livestock is fairly common, but again, we don't know what the implications are for the animals and the grass they are grazing on. At Piedmont Biofarm in North Carolina they are trialling the use of solar panel arrays installed at height to provide shade to enable the growth of crops that cannot survive in the direct sunlight. A trial study in southern France has demonstrated that by reducing the density of the solar panels by half, it was still possible to grow lettuces on the land underneath them. If the 'new climate' created by a solar park is not conducive to crop growth, there may be ways to change the solar PV park, to innovate, to promote better conditions through less intensive clustering of the solar arrays, supporting systems of irrigation, or trials of different types of crop. Next generation solar PV parks could have a particularly important role to play in hot regions where both food and energy are scarce. For example, in the rural communities of Tanzania access to electricity is scarce and food provision an ongoing and ever-increasing challenge. While 'intercropping' (planting two crops close together, so that one is used to improve the yield of the other) can provide shade, there is vast potential for solar panel arrays to maximise both electricity and food production with the right targeted investment. Solar PV parks could increase the amount and diversity of crops grown in such areas and reduce the reliance on expensive 'dirty' fuels that can damage people's health. In such a fast-moving area of technology, backed by government funds and big business investment, where there is so much expectation and hope, we can't afford to lose sight of the bigger environmental picture. There are both negative and positive elements. We don't understand the extent of the implications of the change in land-use and problems involved, but actively addressing the challenges provides opportunities. Solar parks could be contributing a great deal more. A more co-ordinated and integrated effort between industry, policy and researchers is now needed, working together on a network of sites internationally to see what's actually happening and to develop the next generation PV parks that provide multiple benefits from the same land area. • Amended on 9 July to correct the amount of land needed to hit the PV target from 76,000sq km to 6,900-34,500sq km.

"It's tempting to view global warming on, well, a global scale. However, when we think about how climate change affects human and biological systems, it's often the local impacts that matter most. We want to know how things are going to change where we live, not on some abstract global scale.  In the past, local impacts have been very difficult for scientists to assess. One of our most useful tools, climate computer models, are best used to predict how the entire globe will change. These computer models work by subdividing the world into millions of elements or grid boxes. Equations describing conservation of mass, energy, and other processes are solved at each grid box. Then, the grid boxes are assembled to recreate the geometry of the entire Earth system. Just like a puzzle image takes shape when the pieces are brought together, so to the climate takes shapes as the grid boxes are brought together.  But, the weak link in this process is that with today’s computer power, the grid boxes are too large to give a true picture of local variations. We say the grid is “coarse” at the regional scale. Scientists have figured out a clever way around this problem; a way to use coarse global climate programs to get regional information.  The method, which is often called downscaling, was a central tool in a paper just published by a team of scientists including Dr. Matthew Thomas and Dr. Michael Mann, both from Penn State University. This study tackled the problem of malaria – a devastating disease that causes enormous economic and human costs around the world. It is a disease I’ve seen firsthand in my travel and work in east Africa. In the study, published in the journal Climatic Change, the authors acknowledge that malaria and the mosquitoes that carry the parasite are sensitive to daily variations and very local conditions. They downscale global climate models “to provide high-resolution temperature data for four different sites (in Kenya) and show that although outputs from the global and downscaled models predict diverse but qualitatively similar effects,” and some of the modeling approaches led to quite different findings. For instance, the global models underestimated the impact of climate change in hot and cold climate zones. On the other hand, global models over predict the effect in moderate regions.  When asked about his study, Dr. Mann told me, This is one of the first studies to attempt to explore how climate change might impact conditions at the local level. “The results suggest the possibility that population centers in cool highland regions could be more vulnerable than previously thought, while other equally large lowland areas might be less vulnerable. But this would have to be confirmed with more detailed modeling assessments that take into account the full suite of environmental and socio-economic factors that ultimately determine risk of malaria.  While we think this paper is of purely academic interest, or that its implications are limited to malaria, upon further review, the findings are more significant. First, studies like this can help local officials better plan for a warmer and more extreme climate. Secondly, this study charts a pathway for other studies where the outcome depends more on microclimate than macroclimate. We should all be excited about research like this that will help us plan for a future in a way that mitigates some of the costs that global societies will bear worldwide."
"The entire population of Antarctica's famous emperor penguins could fall by a third by the end of the century because of disappearing sea ice, putting them at risk of extinction, researchers said on Sunday. The finding justified protecting emperor penguins under the endangered species act – as America already does for polar bear – the researchers writing in the journal Nature Climate Change said.   They also called for marine reserves to buffer the fish stocks penguin need to survive. “The population is declining. Unless something changes to stop that, the population will go into extinction,” said Hal Caswell, senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and one of the authors. As a top predator in Antarctica, the main threat to emperor penguins’ survival comes from climate change which is melting the sea ice. The loss of sea ice is reducing the supply of krill, the tiny shrimp-like crustaceans that populate the Southern Ocean, and are the emperor penguins’ main food source. Young krill feed off of algae living in the sea ice. When the ice goes, so do the krill.  Changes in the ice around Antarctica may - in the short term - boost some of the emperor penguin populations, especially along the Ross Sea, the researchers said. Sea ice off the western coast of Antarctica has been on the increase, because of break-up of glaciers and winds. But by 2100, all 45 known emperor penguin colonies of Antarctica will be on the decline because of loss of sea ice. Those located on the coasts of the eastern Weddell Sea and the western Indian Ocean will show the sharpest drops. Nine colonies are projected to be “quasi-extinct”, the researchers said. Other studies have raised the threat to emperor penguins under climate change, suggesting the ordinarily hardy 3ft animals are susceptible to rising heat. Smaller penguins like the Chinstrap and Adelie are also at risk from warming.  Researchers from the University of Minnesota last week suggested some emperor penguins may be better equipped to adapt to changing ice conditions than previously thought, by moving their colonies.  But the Woods Hole researchers said their study was the first to forecast a population decline across all of Antarctica. Their study also suggested there was little scope for penguins to adapt to the changing ice conditions. The researchers said the findings called for urgent measures to help the penguins survive – such as legal protections under America’s endangered species act and the creation of marine reserves off Antarctica.  “Implementing a marine protected area in the Ross Sea could help buy time to avoid extinction and to put in place needed conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies,” Stephanie Jenouvrier, lead author and a scientist at Woods Hole, said in a statement. A marine reserve would potentially put large areas of ocean off-limits to fishing – reducing the pressure on krill stocks and giving the penguin a better chance at survival, said Andrea Kavanagh, director of global penguin conservation for the Pew Charitable Trusts. “Given this new research, and what we already know about global temperatures warming and the changing climate, one of the things we should do immediately is put a marine reserve in place so we can make sure that we are not fishing in areas where the penguins need to forage for food,” she said. “It is one way of eliminating one more threat to the penguins.” The study used observations from the colony at Terre Adelie in East Antarctica that has been extensively studied, and satellite data from other known colonies.

"Clive Palmer has repositioned his party’s shift on climate change policy as an economic decision rather than a response to global warming, just days after appearing on a podium beside climate crusader and former US vice-president Al Gore. Palmer now says his support for an emissions trading scheme sometime in the future is because Gore told him that other countries with trading schemes were likely to impose tariffs on imported goods.  “That is something I wanted to explain to the Australian people … regardless of your position on climate change that is the reality of life,” he said. “You will have to have an ETS or otherwise you won’t be able to do international trade … that is why we did it. We didn’t want the Australian people to be disadvantaged.” Similarly he said the Palmer United party had decided to vote against the government’s plan to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation “not on the basis of what it was doing” but because it was “making a profit and employing thousands of people around the country”. The PUP founder made the comments at a voters’ forum and press conference during an open day held at his Palmer Coolum Resort, where he invited the electorate to see his giant robotic dinosaur park, memorabilia including his car collection and a concert by Dean Vegas, an Elvis impersonator. Palmer also returned to the arguments he used when he was sceptical about human-induced climate change. He said his personal understanding of the science of climate change was that mankind’s activities since the 1850s meant it was now contributing 3% rather than 2% of all the carbon in the atmosphere. That meant “nature” was still contributing 97%. “My view is, if that is true … what we need to do is look at what nature is contributing. That is contrary to what most climate change people. So that is where my difference comes in.” And he said his party had decided to vote against changes to the renewable energy target because the government had gone to the election promising not to change it, and governments should keep their promises. “There are so many broken promises in the budget. You can’t have a government that goes around breaking promises.” Asked by Guardian Australia why he had changed his own election policy, which was to make the renewable energy target voluntary – effectively rendering it meaningless – he said that policy had been “developed further”. The party now wanted the RET to stay unchanged until the next election, due in 2016. “It may well be voluntary after 2016, it may not exist after 2016,” he said. The PUP senator-elect Dio Wang told Guardian Australia he did not accept the idea of global warming caused by humans. Palmer said Gore had “made his comments independently of me”. While tariff barriers have been talked about during international climate talks, no country imposes them or has concrete plans to do so. The PUP has said it will back the repeal of the carbon pricing scheme when the new Senate begins in July – but will not support the abolition of the CEFC or the Climate Change Authority and will not back mooted changes to the renewable energy target, which the government has under review. Palmer has said he will try to introduce a new emissions trading scheme with the price set at zero until other countries take action, but this is almost certain to be defeated in the lower house."

"For over two decades, Hussain Ali's house sat in the shade of a strip of greenbelt, one of many that were planted along Islamabad's avenues to help reduce pollution levels and bring some natural beauty to the sprawling city. Now, the street in front of Ali's house is bare. The trees have been uprooted, cut into pieces, and loaded on to trucks to make way for a new bus lane.  All over the city, scenes of tall trees being felled as part of a planned expansion of the metro bus service (MBS) have drawn the anger of experts and citizens who say the project goes against Islamabad's policy for climate-resilient development. ""It is heartbreaking how brutally thousands of trees have been destroyed, most of them over 20 years old, which I have seen grow from seedlings to full-blown maturity,"" Ali said. According to officials at the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in Islamabad, a total of 340,000 square feet of greenbelt has been cleared in the city to create space to build a 13.6 kilometre-long bus lane – a project that shows the potential conflicts between ""green"" efforts. Construction on the $448m project, run by the Rawalpindi Development Authority and National Engineering Services of Pakistan (Nespak), started in March, and aims to ease traffic congestion. The project report says that by the end of the year, 60 buses will be travelling on the dedicated lane, serving about 70,000 commuters daily. ""We hope the project will encourage people to avoid using their cars and instead commute by bus, which should help stop the city from becoming a heat island due to rising emissions levels from the ever-growing number of private vehicles,"" said Nespak's managing director, Amjad Ali Khan. But experts and activists have come out against the metro bus plan, calling it ""environmentally damaging"" and saying it goes against the climate-compatible development principles that were put in place in 2012 to ensure infrastructure projects in Pakistan don't hurt the country's ability to deal with the effects of climate change. ""We are not against the project,"" said Ameer Malik, an environmental impact assessment specialist. ""But we oppose the way it is being executed, which is entirely in violation of the master plan for Islamabad city."" Environment experts in the federal Climate Change Division say that, according to the CDA master plan for the city, not a single tree can be uprooted or a single brick laid in the federal capital without approval from the Pakistan – Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA). According to Muhammad Khursheed, director general of that agency, construction of the new bus lane was started in Islamabad without anyone seeking clearance from the EPA or the development authority. In April, Pak-EPA told the Rawalpindi Development Authority it would not give approval for the project until the agency's 26 objections – including the lack of a body charged with managing the project's solid and hazardous waste, and the lack of a plan to replace destroyed trees – had been addressed. None of the objections have been addressed so far, Khursheed said, and during a public hearing in May a Rawalpindi Development Authority official acknowledged that the project still does not have the necessary approval. Speaking to Thomson Reuters Foundation, Rawalpindi commissioner and bus project director Zahid Saeed would say only that the development authority will eventually address as many of Pak-EPA's objections as possible. In accordance with Pakistan's 1997 Environment Protection Act, an environmental impact assessment was carried out on the bus project – but by the National Engineering Services of Pakistan, a partner in the project, instead of Pak-EPA, which is usually responsible for assessing the environmental friendliness of new construction. Aziz Chandio, deputy director of urban planning at the federal Climate Change Division, said the report is not comprehensive enough. For instance, it does not cover the environmental degradation and mitigation costs and benefits of the project, he said. He said he was surprised it makes no mention of possibly turning the metro bus service into a clean development mechanism project, which would allow it to earn carbon credits from any emission reductions it achieves and sell them on the international market. With Pakistan suffering through increasingly frequent extreme-weather events such as heavy rains and urban flooding, experts have slammed the government and the bus service designers for not including climate resilience in their plans. Following the government's recent announcement that it will build upwards of 15 new coal-fired, carbon-emitting power plants, the country needs its greenbelts now more than ever, they say. Former federal environment minister Hameed Ullah Jan Afridi said preserving and managing urban forests is pivotal to tackling climate change. ""By soaking up the carbon that would otherwise build up and trap heat in the atmosphere, trees and plants are key in staving off global warming,"" he said. Capital Development Authority spokesman Asim Khichi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the trees cut down for the bus project would be sold to timber traders in Rawalpindi and all profits would go towards replanting trees in Islamabad. Still, critics question why the greenbelts had to be destroyed in the first place. Asif Shuja Khan, former director general of Pak-EPA, sees no need to construct separate lanes for buses alongside avenues that already have four lanes. ""One of the pre-existing lanes could be dedicated for the MBS without hurting any part of the greenbelt or cutting down a single tree,"" he said. Nespak's Kashif Bashir, who led the team that carried out the project's environmental impact assessment, insists the dedicated lane is required, ""to prevent everyday commuter issues such as jaywalking and traffic congestion from slowing down the bus service"". So far, the protests of residents and fears expressed by environmental experts have not slowed the project. ""The citizens of Islamabad have a history of protecting the natural environment against irrational and unwise development projects,"" said Tauqeer Ali Sheikh, chief executive of Lead-Pakistan, an independent environmental research and development organization in Islamabad. ""But this time it appears the government has decided to pay no heed to public concerns and to forcibly push ahead."" • Saleem Shaikh and Sughra Tunio are climate change and development science correspondents based in Islamabad • This article was updated on 30 June to correct the square footage of greenbelt that has been cleared to create new bus lanes"

"The BBC has rejected claims by the former UK chancellor, Lord Lawson, that debate on global warming has been silenced by the corporation. In an article for the Daily Mail headlined 'I've been banned by the BBC!': Ex-Chancellor Lord Lawson, a passionate climate change sceptic, accuses BBC bosses of silencing debate on global warming, the chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a thinktank that is sceptical of climate science, wrote that the BBC had displayed ""outrageous behaviour"" towards dissenting voices on climate change.  Leaked reports suggest the BBC's editorial complaints unit will rule shortly that the broadcaster broke its guidelines on due accuracy in a Today programme interview with Lawson and Prof Sir Brian Hoskins on climate change and floods in February.  Last week, the BBC Trust said that nearly 200 journalists have taken part in workshops training them on not introducing ""false balance"" to science coverage, particularly on non-contentious issues such as man's role in climate change. In his article, Lawson wrote: ""If there is to be a ban on non-scientists discussing climate change issues (which I do not, of course, support), this should in the best BBC tradition be an even-handed one. That is to say, they should also ban non-scientists such as energy secretary Ed Davey, Ed Miliband, Lord Deben (chairman of the government’s climate advisory committee), Lord Stern (former adviser to the government on the economics of climate change and development) and all the others who are regularly invited to appear."" He added: ""The truth is that the BBC’s outrageous behaviour is nothing whatever to do with whether I am a climate scientist or not. Indeed, it is not about me at all."" He also accused the head of the BBC’s editorial complaints unit, Fraser Steel, of writing to promise a complainant that Lawson could never appear on Today programme again, and suggests the BBC apologised to the complainant for allowing Lawson on the show.  Steel says this is not the case and he has the correspondence to prove it. In a statement, the BBC said: ""Nigel Lawson has not been banned and nor is there a ban on non-scientists discussing climate change. We have also not apologised for putting him on air. The BBC is absolutely committed to impartial and balanced coverage, whatever the subject, and would not bow to pressure from any quarter whatever the story. This ruling found a false balance was created in that the item implied Lord Lawson’s views on climate science were on the same footing as those of Sir Brian Hoskins.  ""Our position continues to be that we accept that there is broad scientific agreement on climate change and we reflect this accordingly. We do however on occasion offer space to dissenting voices where appropriate as part of the BBC’s overall commitment to impartiality."""
"Clive Palmer is understood to be meeting the former US vice president and climate campaigner Al Gore in another indication that his Palmer United party may be about to make big changes to its position on climate policy. Guardian Australia understands Palmer is considering backing some elements of the existing climate scheme. His party may vote against the abolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the independent Climate Change Authority and could possibly back some delay in the repeal of the carbon price while other policy options are considered. The PUP is also considering its position on the renewable energy target (RET), which the government is reviewing.  Some sources have even suggested PUP could consider backing a floating carbon price, although this would be a very big shift from its election platform where it supported the carbon price repeal. As Palmer prepares for a 5.30pm press conference to announce his position, possibly in the company of Gore, the Greens leader, Christine Milne, has indicated she could back an immediate shift to a floating carbon price. Sources close to Milne said she is seriously considering an earlier move to flexible pricing to try to avoid the carbon price being repealed. According to the sources, Milne’s current thinking is that what she calls Tony Abbott’s “denialist” climate policy means that a much lower flexible carbon price would be preferable to nothing at all and might be more attractive to the new Senate. Palmer and his three senators-elect met to finalise their position on the carbon tax repeal and other key pieces of legislation before the announcement. The PUP leader told the ABC his announcement would have international significance. “Wednesday night we'll have an announcement to make on what we think is a solution for Australia and the world,” he said, predicting it would be a “big day, massive day”. The Green sources said the possibility Palmer was considering some shift in his previous clear position in favour of repeal had crystallised Milne’s thinking on bringing forward a floating price, because it meant there was some chance it could succeed. Under existing law the fixed carbon price is set to rise to $25.40 next week. A floating price would mirror the international price which is about $8. Under the existing law the carbon price would move to a floating price in July 2015. If the PUP did make the extraordinary shift of backing a quicker move to a floating price it would pass the Senate with the backing of the Greens and Labor – who took the same policy to the last election. It is highly unlikely to be accepted by the government, setting up a showdown on the central policy debate of the 2013 election. Also complicating the picture is the position of the independent senator Nick Xenophon, who told Guardian Australia this week he wanted a vote on the carbon repeal delayed until the government provided more information about its alternative Direct Action scheme. Also, the Motoring Enthusiast senator, Ricky Muir, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the PUP, but has also indicated he will vote independently on some issues. Muir’s advisers have also indicated he could support the retention of the CEFC, which is also backed by Xenophon and the DLP senator John Madigan. Palmer is scheduled to meet Tony Abbott on Thursday morning."

"""As glaciers start to advance again, evidence suggests that the Earth may be entering a new ice age,"" read the headline in a fascinating article recently republished from the Guardian archive. Originally dated 12 June 1962, the article had followed a bitterly cold winter and spring and a cool summer as well, which raised the question: ""Is there some great change of climate under way?""  This was very much a piece of speculation, but there were many other scare stories around that time about a new ice age on the way. It's easy to understand why – there were some hard winters and atrocious summers in the 1960s and early 1970s. And even though almost all climate scientists agreed that carbon dioxide was creating a warmer climate, some thought that a cooling of the climate might offset much of the global warming, at least for another few decades or so. In hindsight, the ice age prediction looks insane. Climate prediction in the 1970s was based on flimsy data, and computer modelling was still in its infancy and extremely crude. There was also a deep-seated feeling that after 10,000 years since the last ice age, we should be due another one. Today there is not much sign of a colder climate across the world, but those dire pronouncements of a new ice age still haunt climate scientists as sceptics use it as a reason to disbelieve climate warming, even though the evidence for rising world temperatures is now far stronger."
"We all know that some climate change is natural, in fact, even without humans, the Earth’s climate changes. But, as we have added heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, we have seen human influence “emerge” from natural variability. Droughts, one of the most intensely studied climate events, are a perfect example of an effect with both human and natural influences. Separating the relative strengths of the influences is a challenge for scientists. But, when we deal with drought, with its large social and economic costs, it is a challenge we must undertake.   A very recent study tries to do just this. Published in the Journal of Climate, authors Richard Seager and Martin Hoerling cleverly used climate models forced by sea surface temperatures to separate how much of the past century’s North American droughts have been caused by ocean temperatures, natural variability, and humans. What they found was expected (all three of these influence drought), but it's the details that are exciting. Furthermore, the methodology can be applied to other climate phenomena at other locations around the globe. The very beginning of their paper sets a great framework for the study, “In a nation that has been reeling from one weather or climate disaster to another, with record tornado outbreaks, landfalling tropical storms and superstorms, record winter snowfalls, and severe droughts, persistent droughts appear almost prosaic. Droughts do not cause the mass loss of life and property destruction by floods and storms. They are instead slow-moving disasters whose beginnings and ends are even often hard to identify. However, while the social and financial costs of hurricane, tornado, and flood disasters are, of course, tremendous, droughts are one of the costliest of natural disasters in the United States.” Droughts can be caused by a variety of isolated or interacting phenomena. At its root, drought results from lowered precipitation and sometimes higher temperatures (which increase evaporation rates). The onset of drought can often be linked to variations in ocean temperatures. For instance, La Niña events in the Pacific Ocean as well as elevated Atlantic Ocean temperatures have coincided with United States droughts.  In fact the authors state that the three mid-to-late 19th century droughts, the Dust Bowl, and the drought in the 1950s all depended on persistent La Niña conditions. Of course, other factors played roles as well and ocean temperatures simply don’t explain everything. Perhaps the best example of multiple drought factors is the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Then, cool Pacific temperatures were not by themselves sufficient. It is likely that land use changes associated with farmland erosion and natural atmospheric variability also played roles.  The authors, therefore, wanted to move beyond a simplistic association of La Niña episodes and warm Atlantic Ocean waters with the occurrence of drought. They asked what other causes might there be and how will things change in the coming years and decades? Using precipitation data from the University of East Anglia and ocean temperatures from the Hadley Centre combined with climate models, the researchers were able to add or omit the oceanic temperatures and compare the two sets of results. They found that ocean temperature variations cause up to 40% of the changes to precipitation, depending on location. They also found that the oceans can “nudge” the atmosphere to create conditions that are amenable to drought, and that temperature increases associated with human-driven global warming also play a role. In fact,    “The warming leads to a simulated long-term reduction in soil moisture which, although of weak magnitude compared to soil moisture deficits induced by naturally occurring droughts in the southwest United States, would imply that drought conditions may be entered more quickly and alleviated more slowly owing to long-term warming … Radiative forcing of the climate system is another source of predictability, although not really a welcome one, and rising greenhouse gases will lead to a steady drying of southwest North America. However this is a change that is only now beginning to emerge and currently is exerting less influence on precipitation variability than ocean variability or internal variability.” This conclusion agrees with other researchers who have shown that, while human-emitted greenhouse gas warming may not cause a particular drought, it can make drought come on earlier, faster, and harder than it otherwise would. There are two issues that I will be watching closely. The first is that any extra damage caused by drought as a consequence of human emissions will not scale linearly with attribution. For instance, if human impacts are responsible for 10% of a drought’s severity, it does not mean that human impacts are responsible for 10% of the social or economic cost.   A great example of this is with Superstorm Sandy. While admittedly not a drought, the example will make the point. It has been estimated that human-caused increases to water temperatures caused perhaps 10% more rain to fall. This extra 10% rainfall caused more than 10% of the economic damages associated with rainfall. Similarly, the human-induced sea level rise of 1 foot was only about 10% of the storm surge. But, this extra foot caused a disproportionate amount of flood damage. With this in mind, I would really like to know how the social and financial costs will change in the future as droughts set in earlier, faster, and harder because of greenhouse gas warming. Secondly, there may well be a human influence on these otherwise natural causes. For instance, scientists have argued that greenhouse gas warming may change the ocean temperature fluctuations, particularly in the Pacific. Similarly, there are many new studies linking increasing greenhouse gases with atmospheric circulation changes. Since both of these features affect drought, they appear, at least to me, to be potential indirect human influences. We will have to wait to learn more, let’s hope the wait isn’t too long."

"Fueled by national ethanol mandates, livestock feed demand and growing exports, US corn production has nearly doubled in the past two decades and is now the nation’s biggest cash crop. Last year’s record harvest was nearly 14bn bushels, enough corn to fill a freight train that can circle the earth. Only 10% of the corn is for direct human consumption. But, as a new Ceres report reveals, the corn sector’s prodigious growth is taking a major toll on water quality and shrinking water supplies.  US corn production today uses vast amounts of water and fertilizer, far more than any other agriculture sector. Driven by high corn prices, record demand and generous federal subsidies, a growing number of midwest farmers are forsaking traditional conservation steps, such as crop rotations and use of cover crops, that would limit soil erosion and fertilizer runoff. They are also expanding production into highly erodible and ecologically sensitive lands, oftentimes wetlands. In wetter states such as Iowa, there’s also been a sharp uptick in the use of tile drainage systems, a network of below-ground pipes that help keep root systems dry by capturing and draining off excess water (oftentimes laden with fertilizer) into nearby streams. The impacts from these damaging practices are adding up. In Iowa, the biggest problem is nitrate pollution in streams, rivers and water supplies. Last summer, the regional drinking water facility in Des Moines saw record nitrate levels — well above the EPA’s allowable limit. “The highest levels we’ve ever seen,” said watershed advocate Linda Kinman, whose department ran the world’s largest nitrate removal facility at full throttle last summer to remove the pollutants. Corn-fertilizer runoff is the single largest source of nitrogen pollution to the Gulf of Mexico’s hypoxic ""dead zone,"" an area the size of Connecticut that is devoid of aquatic life. Lack of water is another problem, especially in High Plain states such as Kansas, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska, which rely on fragile groundwater aquifers to irrigate their thirsty cornfields. The Ceres report shows that more than half of the country’s irrigated corn production, worth more than $9bn a year, depends on groundwater from the Ogallala aquifer where groundwater supplies are already declining. Climate change trends will likely add to these pressures. The National Climate Assessment forecasts more droughts and extreme heat in the High Plain states and more heavy rains and floods in states further north such as Iowa. Corn growers and policymakers are well aware of the industry’s wide-ranging water challenges, but finding comprehensive solutions is not easy. All across Iowa, there are pockets of innovation. Tim Smith, who grows corn and soybeans on more than 500 acres in Eagle Grove, is using small woodchip bioreactors to capture nitrates that are running off his fields from tile drains. He’s also growing cover crops (cereal rye) each fall to cut down on fertilizer use. The cover crops “sequester and recycle the nitrogen rather than sending it down the tile drains,” Smith said. Matthew Liebman, an agronomist at Iowa State University, is using three- and four-crop rotations — principally, corn, soy, oats and alfalfa — on 22 acres of experimental fields to reduce herbicide and fertilizer use. The results are powerful. “On average, we’re using 90% less nitrogen and getting higher (corn) yields,” he said. But getting the rest of the industry to adopt these more labor-intensive practices is hugely challenging. The biggest impediment is federal policies — such as ethanol fuel mandates, crop insurance subsidies and corn price supports — that incentivize growing corn on as many acres as possible with little regard for conservation. Toothless state and federal rules for limiting polluted runoff from farms are another big problem. EPA and state of Iowa have both adopted goals for reducing nitrogen pollution by 45%, but compliance is completely voluntary. Regulations for limiting groundwater withdrawals are also generally weak. Perhaps the biggest catalyst for change could be the industry itself — in particular, the food, feed and energy companies which have an enormous stake in ensuring the long-term productivity and reliability of US corn production. Companies such as Coca-Cola, General Mills and Unilever have set goals to sustainably source all of their priority agricultural ingredients — including corn — by 2020. “We don’t necessarily know how to grow corn, but we do have a good opportunity to influence suppliers,” Jon Radtke, water resources sustainability manager at Coca-Cola North America, told the Associated Press last week. Let’s hope these companies can be successful. Peyton Fleming is a senior director at Ceres, a nonprofit organization mobilizing business leadership on global sustainability challenges.

"Fighting climate change would help grow the world economy, according to the World Bank, adding up to $2.6tn (£1.5tn) a year to global GDP in the coming decades. The findings, made available in a report on Tuesday, offer a sharp contrast with claims by the Australian government that fighting climate change would “clobber” the economy. The report also advances on the work of economists who have argued that it will be far more costly in the long run to delay action on climate change. Instead, Tuesday's report found a number of key policies – none of which included putting an economy-wide price on carbon – would lead to global GDP gains of between $1.8tn and $2.6tn a year by 2030, in terms of new jobs, increased crop productivity and public health benefits. The pro-climate regulations and tax incentives would also on their own deliver nearly a third of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions needed to keep warming below the 2C threshold for dangerous climate change, the bank said. The World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, said the findings put to rest claims that the world could not afford to act on climate change. “These policies make economic sense,” Kim said in a conference call with reporters. “This report removes another false barrier, another false argument not to take action against climate change.” Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott, said during a visit to Canada earlier this month that it was too costly to fight climate change. “What we are not going to do is clobber our economy and cost jobs with things like a job-killing carbon tax,” he said. Kim did not comment directly on Abbott's remarks but he said pointedly that the World Bank study provided solid data on the effects of pro-climate policies, in contrast to “opining” about their costs. “This modelling shows that smart choices that will also improve local and global economies,” Kim said. The findings are also a step forward from the work of economists such as Lord Stern who have focused on the costs of delaying action on climate change. The World Bank report was the first off the blocks of a number of economic studies meant to further the case for taking action on climate change ahead of a critical meeting at the United Nations in September. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has invited world leaders to the UN to try to build momentum in the negotiations for a global climate change deal. American financial leaders have also been making the case that it makes sense to act now on climate change. In an article in the New York Times, Henry Paulson, secretary of treasury under George Bush, called for a carbon tax and said it would be folly for America to remain heavily invested in a carbon-intensive economy.  “We’re staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to both our environment and economy. The warning signs are clear and growing more urgent as the risks go unchecked,” he wrote. “I feel as if I’m watching as we fly in slow motion on a collision course toward a giant mountain. We can see the crash coming, and yet we’re sitting on our hands rather than altering course.” Paulson is due to come out with his own report on climate risks later on Tuesday. In the World Bank report, economists looked at the effects of specific policies in six regions – Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, and the United States – that are both leaders in the world economy and global emissions. None of the policies involved putting an economy-wide price on carbon emissions. Instead, the bank used computer modelling to gauge the effects of specific measures – such as installing dedicated bus lanes in India or clean cook stoves in China, or introducing more efficient air conditioning and other building systems in Mexico. The annual benefits of those policies included GDP growth of between $1.8tn and $2.6tn – which was an estimated 1.5% higher than under a business as usual scenario, the bank said. It said the pro-climate pro-climate policies would have other knock-on benefits including avoiding 94,000 deaths a year due to air pollution."
"Nearly half of the Coalition's backbenchers in the lower house have called on the Abbott government to grant the aluminium industry a full exemption from the renewable energy target (RET). The letter – understood to have been signed by 25 Coalition lower house MPs – argued the government could exempt aluminium smelting and still achieve a “true” 20% renewable energy usage target by 2020.  This correspondence to the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, said the target could be met without increasing RET costs to other electricity users or ""grandfathering"" existing renewable energy investments. The call comes as the government awaits the findings of a review of the RET headed by the businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton. It follows a declaration by Clive Palmer last week that his Palmer United party (PUP) would not support any changes to the RET before the 2016 election because the government had promised there would not be any. The PUP senator elect Jacqui Lambie said on Monday she supported her party's position, despite an earlier report that she would seek exemptions from the RET for her state of Tasmania. Dan Tehan, the Liberal MP for Wannan in Victoria, is among Coalition backbenchers calling for the exemption for aluminium smelters from 1 January next year. He said he had a particular interest in the issue because an aluminium smelter in his electorate employed 725 people. In an interview with the ABC, Tehan argued aluminium smelting was “very important” for the stability of the electricity grid. “For instance, the smelter in Tasmania uses 25% of the electricity in Tasmania. In Victoria, it’s roughly 10%. So we need them for the stability of the electricity grid as well,” Tehan said. The joint letter from Coalition backbenchers, including Liberals and Nationals, said aluminium smelting was unique among Australian industries for the intensity of its electricity usage during production. ""Put simply, aluminium smelting has a greater exposure to the RET than any other industry,"" the letter to Hunt and Macfarlane said. ""The sector forecasts it will be paying up to $80m a year in RET costs by 2017, with individual smelters paying between $10m and $25m a year. As you would both be aware, these costs will occur even though there is an existing partial exemption for the sector from the RET, which was negotiated during the previous review due in large part to your support. ""These costs reduce the international competitiveness of Australian smelters at a time when the smelter viability is finely balanced – one smelter having closed recently and another closing this year. It is crucial we must be doing everything we can to ensure the long-term viability of this industry, which directly employs approximately 5,000 people and earns Australia export earnings estimated at $3bn per annum."" The chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor, said the aluminum industry had been in trouble “but for its own reasons”. “Many of these plants are decades old; there hasn’t been the investment to upgrade them or certainly to be aware of the challenges they faced,” Connor told the ABC. “Aluminium is an industry which is a very heavy electricity user. Some call aluminium congealed electricity. Industries have been on notice about the need to clean up their act now for at least two decades, so I think if they keep coming back and saying ‘can we please have some more’ then we are in big trouble in this country.” Connor said the aluminium industry already had “significant subsidies” under the RET and the Climate Institute was not opposed to assistance for “genuinely trade-exposed”. “But we’ve got now a fresh outbreak of rent-seeking it would appear across the board,” he said, arguing the RET was a key part of what may remain of the government’s climate policy. The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said an exemption for the biggest polluting industries would ""totally undermine"" the RET. ""The point of the renewable energy target is to see the whole economy move away from this unsustainable and unhealthy use of polluting fossil fuels,"" she said. ""Aluminium companies are already heavily subsidised and have been profiting off the backs of the community for years. How much harder will the Abbott government let them lean?"" The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the letter was an example of division within the government. Lambie said, in line with PUP policy, she would not support any changes to the RET before 2016. But Lambie said she would “continue to fearlessly fight for a special economic zone, which will drastically reduce all government taxes, regulations and charges for all Tasmanian business”."

"Mayors from the GOP-dominated states of Texas and Arizona are calling on cities to use nature to fight the impacts of climate change, even while Republican governors and lawmakers repeatedly question the science that shows human-caused pollution contributes to global warming. As conservative governors criticize the US Environmental Protection Agency's new rules designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, the mayors – many from cities already struggling with climate-change effects – are taking steps and spending money to stem the damage.  Attendees of the US Conference of Mayors will vote Monday on a resolution that encourages cities to use natural solutions to ""protect freshwater supplies, defend the nation's coastlines, maintain a healthy tree cover and protect air quality,"" sometimes by partnering with nonprofit organizations. It's being backed by Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, Houston Mayor Annise Parker and Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton – all Democrats. Since the conference is almost evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, and the resolution only ""encourages"" steps rather than mandating action, Leffingwell believes it will easily be approved Sunday since it quickly passed through the committee on Friday. ""The best strategy is not to get involved in partisan politics,"" said Leffingwell, who noted that Texas Governor Rick Perry may be a climate-change skeptic, but he still supported the state's move to invest $2bn in water infrastructure after a debilitating drought in 2011. ""He doesn't have to acknowledge climate change to know that the facts are there. ... We want to take the steps that would advance the things that we all believe in without getting into some ideological argument,"" Leffingwell added. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told an audience of mayors on Sunday that they could turn the debate on climate change into a discussion about economics, public safety and health rather than strictly politics. Local action could also serve as an example to skeptical lawmakers at the state level, she argued. ""You have shown them what leadership on this issue can bring,"" McCarthy said. For coastal cities such as Galveston, Houston and New York City, as well as more arid regions of the country, such as Phoenix and Sacramento, California, there is no time for debate – climate change's effects are real. Galveston's seawall didn't stand up to Hurricane Ike in 2008, partly because of the sea level rise that allowed the storm's surge to reach inner areas. Officials began to rethink protections, leading Galveston and nearby coastal communities to collaborate with The Nature Conservancy to restore oyster reefs and wetland habitats that could better help protect communities. New York learned similar lessons after Superstorm Sandy. Quickly after, it became clear some man-made solutions – such as seawalls or underwater fencing – are expensive and not always effective. The city also asked the Nature Conservancy to study how built defenses could be combined with ""natural infrastructure"" to buffer a city that's becoming more vulnerable. Howard Beach, a low-lying, flat area of Queens, was pounded by Sandy. The Nature Conservancy's report concluded that significant, cost-efficient defenses could be achieved by re-vegetating shorelines and restoring mussel beds and wetlands in combination with more traditional solutions, such as sea walls. Heat and debilitating drought is worsening in some parts of Arizona and California. Sacramento is using trees for part of the solution, and the city has outlined a detailed ""climate plan"" for the coming decades. Bill Finch, the mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and co-chair of the conference's climate task force, said some mayors in mid- and large-sized cities have had a climate plan for about seven years. Party politics are irrelevant, he said, pointing out that his co-chair on the committee is Carmel, Indiana, Republican James Brainard. Carmel put roundabouts at 84 intersections. Studies have shown such traffic patterns can cut down on emissions. Now, Finch plans to implement a similar plan in his community. ""Mayors have to go to the grocery store and listen to families complain about kids with asthma ... that their flooding is getting worse,"" Finch said, pointing out that the steps in the resolution would also give cities more parks and green space. ""This is not a cause for mayors. This is a pragmatic problem that requires pragmatic solutions,"" Finch said."
"Recently I was called an ""apocaloptimist"" – a term I hadn't heard before. Galling, because I've written a book titled Cancel the Apocalypse which, it might be argued, embodies apocaloptimism. In fact it is slightly off. An apocaloptimist is defined online (it is yet to be recognised by respectable dictionaries) as: ""someone who knows it’s all going to s**t, but still thinks it will turn out ok.""  Certainly, I see climate trends mostly braced for cacotopia (yes, that is a real word, and means pretty much what it sounds like).  As a recent report on fossil fuels, To the Ends of the Earth, summarised: globally we consume ever more energy per person, the amount used per unit of economic output is going up again, and we’re literally scraping the geological oil barrel to find ever dirtier fuels to feed demand. However, rather than thinking things will turn out okay, I only think that they could, if we draw the logical conclusions about necessary action from what we know. Nevertheless, half-smiling in recognition, it struck me that to avoid the twin evils of denial or despair, it’s a state of mind that must be increasingly common. Are you hooked on an almost certainly doomed national football team at the World Cup? Be an apocaloptimist. Young and want to buy your own home in Britain? Ditto. Europhile, peace lover in the Middle East, polar bear? Ditto, ditto, ditto. But why be upbeat when it is so easy for others to mock, as the contrary facts tower over you? The comment aimed at me almost certainly wasn’t a compliment. Here’s seven reasons to be an apocaloptimist: So, yes, my name is Andrew Simms and I am an apocaloptimist. The climate clock is still ticking yet there are incredible opportunities to make things better. I just wish I’d discovered the word before finishing the book."
"Britons should not expect key services to work constantly in future, engineers have warned, as the nation's infrastructure struggles to cope with the increasing number of extreme weather events. The Institution of Civil Engineers said immediate attention and significant investment is required to maintain energy networks, flood defences and waste systems. It said local transport is substandard and particularly at risk, and that the ""unsexy"" business of maintenance risked being neglected in favour of new projects.  In its State of the Nation: Infrastructure 2014 report, the ICE said climate change would make it increasingly difficult to run transport and power networks fully in all weather conditions, and the public should be primed to expect more failures. The report, based on hundreds of interviews and submissions from leading professionals in industry and government, said the resilience of infrastructure was a major concern. The engineers pointed to the narrowing gap between energy supply and demand, vulnerability to flooding and a decline in the maintenance of local roads and flood defences after cuts. The ICE said an awareness of the potential for multiple failures when one part of the system goes down, should be a key criterion when prioritising infrastructure projects. But it added that the public would need to lower its expectations of what services could be delivered in all conditions. ICE vice-president Keith Clarke said: ""There are going to be more frequent and more extreme weather events and we will be closing our infrastructure more often. We need to make clear to the public that availability will be subject to weather."" He said last winter's floods showed there could be a domino effect when defences broke down, hitting transport, energy, water and waste networks. ""We must all recognise that our infrastructure cannot be resilient to everything. It will become more difficult to run all services in all conditions; it will also not be cost-effective. Funding will always be constrained as there are only two sources – tax and user charging – both ultimately falling on the consumer. Clearly there are some difficult decisions ahead … what networks can and should operate 24/7 in what conditions."" At the launch of the report, politicians warned that at least one major strategic transport infrastructure project – a new airport runway in the south-east – was likely to be further deferred. Lord Adonis, shadow minister of state for infrastructure, said business and aviation should be wary of pinning hopes on the Airports Commission led by Howard Davies, which will deliver its verdict after the next election: ""Anything Davies recommends is going to be hugely controversial."" He said opponents would argue, particularly if a third Heathrow runway was selected, that the decision was ""illegitimate"" as parties did not make their preferences clear before the general election. The Davies commission was seen by many as a device for the coalition to kick a toxic political question into the long grass. But, Adonis said, the delays could carry on after the report is published: ""The easiest thing in the world would be for whoever is in government in a year's time to find [another] good piece of long grass, [like] the need for further development work and consultation. We could easily lose another parliament."" Lord Heseltine, who last year published a growth plan for the coalition, said he would expect a Conservative government to act on Davies's recommendations if it won in 2015. But, he said: ""The chances of getting consensus on this issue is very limited and that won't go away after the election."""
"This week, the Abbott government has attempted to cut debate on its proposal to repeal the Clean Energy Future Act and abolish Australia's carbon price. The new senate has a powerful cross-bench of independent senators who hold the balance of power; the Abbott government must negotiate either with Labor or the Palmer United Party and other independent senators. Last month, coal-baron Clive Palmer dazzled the media and derailed Tony Abbott's climate policy agenda by announcing his party would vote for the retention of the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and in-principle support for an emissions trading scheme.  Now, his party and an allied independent, Ricky Muir, who was elected under the banner of the Motoring Enthusiasts Party, have the power to keep or destroy Australia's carbon pricing scheme. (Muir has come out recently to support the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and his spokesman has said that Muir supports renewable energy, according to a Guardian report.) However, events move quickly, and senators' votes may change. Despite the misleading rhetoric from Abbott and his climate-denying, renewable energy opposing business advisors, the carbon price has actually done very well. None of Abbott's histrionic doomsday prophecies have eventuated — there has been no python squeeze, Whyalla remains on the map, a leg of lamb costs less than $100 and electricity prices haven't skyrocketed. In fact, the Australian economy, despite Abbott's car industry mismanagement and industry-policy negligence, has done rather well. Unemployment remains low in most states, economic growth is good, and interests rates are stable. On top of that, carbon pollution from regulated sectors is reducing. Renewable energy production is increasing. Clean-energy jobs are growing. The ""carbon price"" policy is much more than the price, although that is the most obvious element of it. A far more important part of the Clean Energy Future Act is that it legislates an economy-wide cap on carbon emissions. It is this cap which creates scarcity, and under a trading scheme, allows the market to price carbon pollution permits. If Australia is to be a constructive global player in tackling climate change, the emissions cap is an essential policy element. Under Abbott's proposed ""direct action"" policy for a 5 percent reduction in carbon emissions, there would be no cap on carbon pollution. Thus, despite paying major emitters to reduce their emissions, there would be no overall policy lever for the government to actually achieve that 5 percent target. This is one of the primary reasons that most serious economists and all climate policy commentators have criticised the ""direct action"" policy as being useless. So why would you abolish the carbon price? Here's five reasons to keep the carbon price. The main reason to have a carbon price is to reduce carbon pollution. Well, the Clean Energy Future Act is doing exactly that. After two years of operation, total carbon pollution from electricity consumption in the national energy market is ""down by 5.3 million tonnes in the twelve months to May 2014"", according to The Climate Institute. The latest Australian Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows that national emissions continue to drop. Emissions from all sectors excluding land use and forestry fell 0.8 per cent, or 4.3 million tonnes in the year to December 2013. The consistent lie by opponents of the carbon price is that it does not reduce carbon emissions or does not have an impact on global warming. Australia is one of the world's largest emitters of carbon pollution, and the largest per capita. Any reduction from Australia not only shows global leadership (which is at risk of the price was abolished) but has a real, measurable impact on the amount of carbon pollution in our atmosphere. At the same time, the Australian economy grew and over 160,000 jobs were created nationally, which demonstrates the falseness of the criticism that Abbott regularly uses that the carbon price was a ""hand-brake"" on the economy. The price impact of the carbon price has been (as expected) minimal, and far greater influence on electricity costs and other prices are fluctuations in the Australian dollar and commodity prices. One of the biggest lies that Abbott routinely tells is that renewable energy increases electricity prices. This fails the common-sense test. Renewables decreases electricity prices, and even a moment of contemplation shows why. Fossil fuels must pay for the cost of digging up, transporting and refining of the coal or gas, as well as massive infrastructure and maintenance of decades old facilities. Renewables have an upfront cost for installation, ongoing maintenance costs, and then gets its energy free from the wind and sun. Fossil fuels is also exposed to commodity market fluctuations, so the sector is exposed to higher natural gas prices, and coal prices. Household renewable generators are now growing to such a scale that in some states, they are pushing electricity prices to zero, as Giles Parkinson wrote recently for Comment is Free. The Renewable Energy Target is a big reason for the growth in renewables — the target mandates that Australia produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewables by the year 2020 — but the carbon price also assists. It does so by adding a cost to the externality of carbon pollution. The majority of Australia's carbon pollution comes from stationary energy generation, those big coal fired power stations. Until last year, those power stations could pollute with no cost. The Climate Institute noted: ""using the International Monetary Fund's approach to energy subsidies and the ""social cost"" of pollution, the repeal of the carbon price amounted to a subsidy of up to $15 billion to the major polluters."" Major polluters, including fossil fuel producers like Shell, are already operating under a shadow carbon price to plan new projects. Bloomberg reported in May that ""Europe's biggest oil company budgets for future capital investment on the assumption it will pay $40 a metric ton for carbon emissions"", and that it is considering boosting this price. In its sustainability report, Shell explained its decision: Without clear measures to promote investment in more efficient and low-carbon technologies, [the world] risks setting itself on a course to potentially catastrophic climate change. At Shell we advocate publicly and to governments that a strong and stable price on CO2 emissions will help drive the right investments in low-carbon technologies. But we are not waiting for government policy to develop. We consider the potential cost of a project's CO2 emissions, which we set at $40 a tonne, in all our major investment decisions. Shell is not the only company calculating carbon prices into its business plans. Exxon, the world's biggest oil producer, assumes a $60 per ton price. Other major corporations, including oil giant BP, retail giant Wal-Mart and tech giant Google also include carbon prices in internal strategic planning, according to a Reuters report.. While the current Abbott government seems intent on eradicating heavy manufacturing in Australia, most notably the car industry, putting a price on carbon will make our industries more globally competitive over the medium to long term. The effects of climate change will act as a dead-hand on our economy and our industries. Acting now, before the worst effects of global warming hit Australia, can ensure that jobs in industries like manufacturing, energy and mining can be transformed into low-carbon, high-tech jobs. National president of the manufacturing union, Andrew Dettmer wrote: Rather than turning tradespeople into tour guides, the AMWU sought a high skill future where our skills transform manufacturing by building better transportation, better power generation through wind, solar and other means, and smarter life cycle management of manufactured products. ... foundries are one of the success stories of the carbon tax; where nearly $300M was provided to upgrade Australian foundries (most of which date from the 1950s) to newer, lower energy and hence lower emitting smelting technologies. Without policy tools, such as a carbon price and industry policy, the risk is that Abbott's negligence will undermine Australia's economy and jobs market through the double-whammy of a downturn in commodity prices and an eroded manufacturing base. In a letter signed by more than 50 Australian economists, the point is made that the carbon price is ""a necessary and desirable structural reform of the Australian economy, designed to change relative prices in a way that provides an effective incentive to consumers and producers to shift over time to more low-carbon, energy-efficient patterns of consumption and production."" The ABC's fact-checker recently debunked Abbott's often-repeated claim that the world is moving away from pricing carbon, finding that ""the reach of carbon pricing is 'steadily increasing'."" Sixty-six countries that account for 88 percent of global emissions have passed laws to address global warming, according to conservative Lord Debsen, former environment minister under Thatcher. The USA for example has enacted wide-ranging national regulations covering carbon emissions, while nine different states, including California and the New England region, have local carbon trading schemes. Obama's new emissions rules would require states to reduce carbon pollution, which could include joining existing state-level cap-and-trade schemes. China, a major trading partner, is moving to put a cap on carbon emissions, with consideration being given to including it as part of their next Five Year Plan. Within China, there are carbon pricing schemes in seven regional areas, covering 200 million people. Massive renewable energy projects are also being undertaken across China, and China has committed to reducing its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40-45 percent by 2020. Whether the policy mechanism being used is a cap-and-trade, carbon tax or shadow price (i.e. regulations directly curbing carbon pollution), national and state-level governments around the world are putting a price on carbon pollution. As the ABC fact check notes, ""economist Ross Garnaut says he doesn't know of anywhere in the world where carbon pricing is being rolled back."" The simple reality is that the carbon price laws are effective, fiscally responsible, and beneficial for Australia. We have had them now for two years, and polls show that most Australians like them. According to Lonergan research last year, three out of five Australians want the laws kept. More recent polling by JWS shows support for the carbon price has been increasing. The adults in charge. #carbonprice #auspol pic.twitter.com/ucTEdJC5bu — Alexander White (@alexanderwhite) June 27, 2014 A large number of community leaders this week called on the new senate to keep the carbon reduction and renewable energy laws. Cassandra Goldie from the Australian Council of Social Services said that ACOSS supports a price on pollution and renewable power laws, because low-income earners are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. ""People living on low-incomes will be the first and worst hit by the effects of climate change,"" she said. ""It is irresponsible to repeal the clean energy laws when they remain the only credible and independently assessed mechanism for Australia to adopt."" Michael Moore, CEO of the Public Health Association of Australia, said on Tuesday: ""global warming is not only an environmental issue. Without dramatic action the potential for adverse impacts on health are enormous."" Dr Beth Heyde from the Anglican General Synod said: ""The Synod met just last week and unanimously expressed grave concern to the Government that a market mechanism such as an emission trading scheme is not part of its strategy to address climate change."" She noted, ""a market mechanism such as an Emissions Trading Scheme is not a carbon tax — it is a key way by which 21st century Australia can achieve two important goals: lowering the very serious risks from global warming which have been so clearly identified by the IPCC, and moving to a thriving, sustainable economy based on renewable energy rather than fossil fuels."" If the new senators support taking action to reduce the impacts of global warming, then it should vote to keep the carbon price, and especially the carbon cap."
"An umbrella group of churches, which represents over half a billion Christians worldwide, has decided to rule out future investments in fossil fuel companies. The move by the World Council of Churches, which has 345 member churches including the Church of England but not the Catholic church, was welcomed as a “major victory” by climate campaigners who have been calling on companies and institutions such as pension funds, universities and local governments to divest from coal, oil and gas.  In an article for the Guardian in April, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said that “people of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change” and events sponsored by fossil fuel companies could even be boycotted. Bill McKibben, the founder of climate campaign group 350.org, said in a statement: “The World Council of Churches reminds us that morality demands thinking as much about the future as about ourselves – and that there’s no threat to the future greater than the unchecked burning of fossil fuels. This is a remarkable moment for the 590 million Christians in its member denominations: a huge percentage of humanity says today ‘this far and no further’.” The report of the council’s financy policy committee, published on Thursday on the final day of the council’s central committee meeting in Geneva, says that: “The committee discussed the ethical investment criteria, and considered that the list of sectors in which the WCC does not invest should be extended to include fossil fuels.” The WCC does not have any existing investments in fossil fuels. 350.org’s European divestment coordinator, Tim Ratcliffe, said: “The World Council of Churches may be the most important commitment we’ve received yet.” Thursday’s decision only applies to the council’s own future investments, rather than its members, such as the Church of England. A CoE spokeswoman said: “The WCC decision refers to its own financial investments only and not those of its member bodies.” The CoE has not moved yet to divest from fossil fuel companies but has set up a subgroup to take advice on climate change and investment, with a decision expected next year. In May, the UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, gave a speech to faith leaders at St Paul’s cathedral in London, calling on them to show leadership on climate change. She also said religious groups should drop their investments in fossil fuels, and encourage their members to do the same. Studies have suggested the fossil fuel divestment campaign, which began in the US, has been faster than than any previous divestment movement such as tobacco and apartheid."
"Last month was the hottest May globally since records began in 1880, new figures show. The record heat, combined with increasingly certain predictions of an El Niño, means experts are now speculating whether 2014 could become the hottest year on record. Data published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday showed the average land and ocean surface temperature last month was 0.74C above the 20th century average of 14.8C, making it the highest on record. Previously, the warmest May was 2010, followed by 2012, 1998 and 2013.  Worldwide, March-May was the second warmest ever by Noaa's records – 2010 holds the record for that period. April 2014 was also the hottest April ever by Noaa's records. There are two other main global temperature records in addition to Noaa's, one kept by Nasa and the other by the Met Office's Hadley Centre in the UK. The three are combined by the UN's World Meteorological Organisation, which ranks 2010 as the warmest on record, and says that 13 of the 14 warmest years on record occurred in the 21st century. Some forecasters are now predicting a 90% chance of El Niño – the weather phenomenon that can cause drought in Asia and Australia and lead to higher temperatures – happening this year, opening the possibility that 2014 will be the hottest year yet.  Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, in the US, told the Guardian's environment network partner, ClimateCentral: ""I agree that 2014 could well be the warmest on record, and/or 2015, depending on how things play out."""
"Jean-Claude Juncker may not be the right answer, but his candidacy for the presidency of the European commission is at least a response to the right question. The process by which he rose to lead the European People's party list – which then emerged as the largest group in the European parliament – was an attempt to engage voters in the European decisions taken in their name. As such, it confronted the central political issue of our times. We live in a world of increasingly global problems, ineffective national solutions, and consequent disillusion with democratic politics. These tensions will ultimately prove as great a threat to our democracy and our values as the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. Who cares about pretentious, powerless politicians? Powerlessness is stealthy, insidious and corrosive to our belief that politics matters. At least Europe has attempted to respond by electing its supranational legislators.  It is, though, a work in progress. Europe is full of talk of the ""democratic deficit"", even though EU institutions are the only transnational bodies with any elected component. Nor are the voters impressed. Even in Europe, there is scant understanding of the new transnational realities. The European parliament elections showed a yearning for simple, nationalist solutions. Nigel Farage, Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen are tribunes of nostalgia for national certainties. Yet scarcely any problem that people care about passionately is any longer susceptible to a purely national solution, even by a country as big, powerful and besotted with the perfume of sovereignty as the US. Yesterday's American hubris is today's Iraqi disaster. Conflict resolution? Most recent conflicts have begun within societies, not between them. Last week's UN report noted that there are now 51 million refugees and internally displaced people across the world, half of them children. This was the highest level since the second world war, and mainly due to internal conflict in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Yet the UN is no nearer to developing a legitimate template that can impose order in the increasingly common phenomenon of the failed state. Afghanistan, Yemen and Sudan have all been horrible warnings of what can follow from internal collapse, all with consequences far beyond their own frontiers. Ominously, Pakistan is on many experts' danger list, and it is a nuclear weapons state. Even an issue like wealth and income inequality, once the meat and drink of class-based national politics in the old democracies, is not immune. Inequality is likely to grow, as Thomas Piketty has argued. National solutions will not work. High tax rates in one country are liable to be undercut by competitor countries, sometimes gleefully and deliberately, as in the case of George Osborne's explicit decision to cut corporation tax rates. The only solution is international agreement on tax avoidance, evasion and minimum tax rates. Goodbye nation state. Take the prosperity brought by large-scale mass production. The US is so rich in part because of its huge domestic market. If we want our European companies to produce at scale, they have to be able to make the same product for the whole European market. For such a single market to work, every national market has to have similar consumer safety, health and environmental standards. That means at least Europe-wide – and maybe soon transatlantic – rule-setting. Goodbye nation state. Then there is clean water and unpolluted air. Climate change alone makes the case for international action: without it, we are heading inexorably for such extreme weather events that our prosperity will be cataclysmically undermined. Ask the insurers: one group of private companies only too aware of the rising costs and damage of climate change. Take even an area traditionally central to the nation state, such as crime. The European arrest warrant and speedy extradition are responses to the easyJet age. Cybercrime disrespects frontiers as readily as air or sea pollution. Fraud in London may begin in Singapore, and involve counterparties in Zurich. Policing is international, or it is flat-footed. If we cannot grasp these global issues – fundamental to our future prosperity and to our belief in the efficacy of the public realm – the disillusion with national politics will fester. When problems are global, solutions must match. Power is increasingly going to be wielded supranationally. That, in turn, brings the challenge of how to make politics work across language and cultural barriers. This is not a counsel of despair. We have solved global problems such as the hole in the ozone layer. There are also examples of successful, multilingual democracies that provide a model for the public accountability of international power: India, Switzerland and Canada. (I could add Belgium and Luxembourg, but that is more contentious.) Language barriers may even melt as voice-recognition technology gives everyone a hand-held interpreter. But we need a public debate about where the real problems in our democracy lie, rather than hankering for some mystic past in which powerful nations resolved simple problems with the smack of firm government. David Cameron needs to spell out some home truths to his own party, and start to provide some answers himself. The greatest democratic problem today is the weakening power of the nation state faced by threats stretching beyond its borders. The nation's weakness is fatally wounding the prestige of its political elites. Pity the mediocre Juncker, for he carries all the expectations of this new and frightening world."
"The United Nations was presented with a roadmap to avoid a climate catastrophe on Tuesday, prescribing specific actions for the world’s biggest economies to keep warming below 2C. In a report prepared for the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, experts from 30 international institutions set out a range of strategies for the economies responsible for more than two-thirds of global emissions.  The initiative is the first of its kind to try to make concrete plans around the various targets that have been discussed at the UN climate change negotiations over the last two decades, said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, and a leader of the Pathways to Deep Decarbonisation Project. “All we have been doing in these negotiations for all these years is talking about things in the abstract. It’s not producing the deep technological changes that can get us to a low-carbon global economy,” he told the Guardian. The report, with its detailed data on electricity supply, transport and shipping, and building codes in each country, was aimed at remedying this by making the targets operational, he said. It is hoped the study will help to build momentum for a UN climate change summit in New York this September, and so advance the negotiations to reach a global climate deal by the end of 2015. The study looks at the world’s 15 biggest economies: America, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea, which between them account for 70% of global emissions. It rejects the idea that has taken hold since the failed Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 that warming of 4 or 5C is already inevitable. “We do not subscribe to the view held by some that the 2C limit is impossible to achieve and that it should be weakened or dropped altogether,” the report said, adding that the science about the 2C threshold was clear. “The political risks of jettisoning the 2C limit are also significant,” the report went on, and would further weakening the chances of any action. Instead, it was time for leaders to direct government officials and independent institutions to work on the technologies that would actually produce reductions in emissions. To date, the targets discussed at the UN climate talks were detached from reality, the report said. “By and large national targets are not derived from an assessment of what will be needed to stay within the 2C limit,” it said. Sachs said that was in part a function of the UN negotiations process, that left a highly technical discussion to diplomats. “It put the lawyers out front and left the technologists out of the room, and the result is that we have had 21 years of lawyering and no success in application of the international framework,” he said. The result, he said, were emissions reductions targets that were far too conservative to avoid 2C warming. “I didn’t hear President Obama say we have a 2C agreed global warming limit, and I am basing American policy on making sure that is successful. I have not heard any leader saying that,” he said. “Actually, now we have a report that will tell them what it would take.” Those options vary widely according to the country. The report envisages that Britain by mid-century would generate about 35% of its electricity from nuclear power plants and 40% from coal using carbon capture technologies. America too will remain heavily invested in coal, and could generate up to 35% of its electricity from coal using carbon capture technologies. South Africa, which is now heavily dependent on coal, could generate 80% of its electricity from solar energy, while countries such as Australia could achieve cuts in their emissions by switching to electric cars and public transport. The report acknowledges that the technologies it incorporates in its findings – including carbon capture – are not yet available on a widespread, commercial scale. It also makes no attempt to offer a cost-benefit analysis of the sweeping transformation that would be needed in all 15 countries to keep warming within 2C. Sachs said those aspects would be dealt with in a final report due next year."
"Poland is “the real challenge” to a European agreement on carbon cutting targets for 2030, the UK energy secretary has warned. Brussels is aiming to agree a 2030 climate and energy package by October, that can contribute to global negotiations in Lima scheduled for December. Draft proposals published by the European Commission in January included a 40% carbon reduction target.  Meanwhile, Europe is also working on policy to boost energy security, after tensions in the Ukraine sparked concern over the bloc’s reliance on Russian fossil fuel imports. Ed Davey, UK energy and climate change secretary, told a parliamentary committee there is “huge overlap” between security of supply and climate change policies. ”Energy efficiency is the most important policy for both. Having home grown energy, whether nuclear or renewables, is one of the best ways of having energy security.” Poland is an exception, he said, due to its dependence on polluting coal for energy. ”From a Polish perspective, coal gives them energy security. That is why you have got to put yourself in the shoes of the Polish government and Polish industry.” Davey has been engaging “extremely actively” with Poland and the other central European countries that form the Visegrad Group: Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia. These countries teamed up with Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania in May to demand compensation for the “excessive burden” of climate targets imposed by Europe. In the 2020 framework Europe is currently working towards, some member states were given a more demanding share of the overall target than others. Davey said that approach could be extended. Backing Poland to develop carbon capture and storage could also help, he suggested. Subject to Poland coming round, Europe should “at least” be able to agree on a 40% emissions cut, Davey told the House of Lords. ”I would regard 40% as a good outcome but I would not leave it there.” Davey said Europe needs to be more ambitious to limit global temperature rises to 2C. ”We were never going to get there in one go, that is realpolitik, but in the context of a global deal we could go to 50%.” Recent developments in China and the USA are “really heartening”, Davey said. He will also be discussing the matter with India, which has just elected new prime minister Narendra Modi. ”If prime minister Modi is prepared to move India into a deal, that would be very helpful.”"
"The federal MP Andrew Laming has riled members of a green group after responding to an email calling for action on climate change by questioning whether the author uses the power grid or owns a car. Laming, the Liberal National party member for the federal electorate of Bowman, sent the response on 2 July to “Den”, a Brisbane-based supporter of the Australian Conservation Foundation.  Den’s missive to Laming urges him to “act in the best interests of the Australian people and not drop the ball on climate action now. Please stick up for our climate and support the price on pollution.” Laming replied by stating: “Thanks Den for your enthusiasm to reduce emissions. Bravo. “I presume your dwelling is completely off mains power and you don’t own a vehicle. That would demonstrate how serious you are about emissions reduction. Don’t disappoint me. Andrew.” On the same day as the email, which Laming’s office has confirmed is genuine, the MP posted a similar message on his Facebook page: “Anyone out there still want the carbon tax imposed on everyone else? If so, I assume your house if off mains power and you don’t own a vehicle. When you do that, I know you’re serious about minimising carbon emissions.” ACF posted the email exchange on its own Facebook page, prompting supporters to attack Laming for a “misleading” and “simplistic” response. ACF said more than 360 comments were posted on Laming’s page in protest at the email, most of which were deleted. The conservation group itself directed a post to Laming, saying: “Australians are taking individual responsibility through solar, wind and investment in renewables. Your redirection of the conversation to the size of some person's car shows a lack of understanding of the need for national climate policy to significantly reduce emissions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.” Laming, who recently provided a whiteboard explanation to Guardian Australia of this year’s budget, was unbowed, however. He posted on ACF’s page: “Please everyone. Instead of confected indignation, address the point of the post. “How much are you personally doing to reduce emissions; before you go supporting tax policies that take away jobs from low-income families. Fair question, if you are up for a genuine debate. If not, I can’t do much about it. Lovely to see all this aggro from people who don’t live in my electorate!”"
"The conservative YG Network recently published a series of ‘reform conservative’ essays called ‘Room to Grow,’ designed to create a ‘thriving middle class’ while limiting the size of government. Those essays have been subject to intense criticism from Vox’s Matt Yglesias and New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait for failing to even mention climate change despite devoting a chapter to energy policies. Adam White, author of that energy policy chapter, pushed back by arguing, There's no shortage of talk about climate change—its causes, its dangers, and the challenges and costs of regulating it. Unfortunately, in terms of conservative climate policies, that’s not an accurate statement. When it comes to global warming, today’s conservative American policymakers most often deny the scientific evidence that climate change is a problem to begin with. When discussions are able to move beyond the stage of science denial, conservative policymakers will generally assert – without any supporting evidence – that climate policies will kill jobs and cripple the economy. In reality, studies have shown that the opposite is true: smart climate policies can have minimal economic impact and even grow the economy. Cap and trade was invented by Republicans as a free market alternative to government regulation of pollutants. The more popular proposal today is a revenue neutral carbon tax; another free market solution that also doesn’t increase the size of government, because 100% of the revenue generated is returned to taxpayers via monthly refund checks. This proposal has support among conservative economists and some other influential Republicans, but not among Republican policymakers.  When was the last time you remember reading or hearing a Republican wonk or policymaker discuss the best policy response to global warming? As Yglesias and Chait pointed out, a series of ‘reform conservative’ essays would have been a great place to begin to remedy the lack of conservative contributions to the climate policy discussion, but none was to be found in ‘Room to Grow.’ In defense of the essays, in The New York Times, Ross Douthat pointed out that recently, Ramesh Ponnuru and Reihan Salam, reformocons both, were devoting their columns to the issue However, Ponnuru’s column was devoted to attacking President Obama for allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to do its legally-mandated job by regulating greenhouse gas emission from power plants. Aside from noting that the cap and trade legislation killed by a Republican filibuster in 2010 “probably had a better cost-benefit ratio than today's regulations do,” Ponnuru didn’t even discuss any policy alternatives. Salam at least discussed his objections to existing cap and trade systems, but his piece exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding of the economic concepts involved, saying, what artificial pricing really does is encourage investment in expensive technologies that couldn’t survive without an artificial leg up That’s completely backwards. The purpose of putting a price on carbon pollution is to reflect energy technologies’ true full costs in their market prices. Right now fossil fuels have artificially low prices because industries are allowed to pump endless amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere for free, forcing the rest of us to pay for those costs through the damages they cause via climate change. Putting a price on that carbon pollution evens out the playing field such that the prices of various energy sources reflect their actual costs. Ultimately both Ponnuru and Salam suggest that we should instead take a “technology first approach,” which essentially boils down to crossing our fingers and hoping that technological breakthroughs by themselves will achieve sufficient emissions cuts. Given the scope of the climate problem we face, that’s not a remotely sufficient or serious policy position. In his piece, Ross Douthat also said that he doesn’t support carbon pricing proposals because he believes the costs of such a system will exceed the benefits. To support this belief, Douthat referred to articles written by Jim Manzi, who’s a software entrepreneur with a background in math, not economics. Manzi in turn supports his argument with references to the work of climate economist William Nordhaus. Now we’re finally getting to a credible source with supporting research and evidence!  The problem is that Nordhaus’ work unambiguously concludes that we should put a price on carbon pollution – 180 degrees from Douthat’s argument. In fact, Nordhaus got so sick of his work being misrepresented that in 2012 he wrote an article bluntly titled Why the Global Warming Skeptics Are Wrong. Nordhaus wrote (emphasis added), My research shows that there are indeed substantial net benefits from acting now rather than waiting fifty years. A look at Table 5-1 in my study A Question of Balance (2008) shows that the cost of waiting fifty years to begin reducing CO2 emissions is $2.3 trillion in 2005 prices. If we bring that number to today’s economy and prices, the loss from waiting is $4.1 trillion. Wars have been started over smaller sums. My study is just one of many economic studies showing that economic efficiency would point to the need to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions right now, and not to wait for a half-century. Waiting is not only economically costly, but will also make the transition much more costly when it eventually takes place. Current economic studies also suggest that the most efficient policy is to raise the cost of CO2 emissions substantially, either through cap-and-trade or carbon taxes, to provide appropriate incentives for businesses and households to move to low-carbon activities. Manzi doesn't believe that a carbon tax will play out in the real world the way it plays out in economic models. However, uncertainty cuts both ways. It's very possible that economic models underestimate the costs of climate damages, in which case a carbon tax that slows global warming would be an even bigger net economic benefit than the models indicate. In any case, economists agree that a carbon tax would be good for the economy. The silver lining is that some of these ‘reform conservatives’ like Douthat seem to at least accept basic climate science. That’s a start. However, by opposing any meaningful climate policy in favor of wishful thinking that technology will save us, the end result is no different. We’re still left without any serious contributions to the climate policy debate from most conservatives. As Ryan Cooper wrote for The Week, They neither articulate a clear view of what kind of climate goals they would prefer nor demonstrate how their favorite policies would get us there. Instead, like Douthat, the few conservatives who even talk about climate (like Reihan Salam and Ramesh Ponnuru, who he mentions) are constantly saying whatever policy is on deck at the moment is no good. ‘Reform conservatism’ seems to be a small step in the right direction on climate change, away from basic science denial, but it doesn’t go nearly far enough. They’re still clinging to misrepresentations of economics research, failing to consider economically beneficial climate policy proposals, and instead argue that we can solve the problem by crossing our fingers and hoping for a technological miracle. Until conservative policymakers and wonks come to the table with a serious contribution to the climate policy discussion, we’ll be stuck with government regulations of carbon pollution. From an economic perspective, this isn’t an ideal solution, but until conservatives renew their support of free market solutions, it’s the only solution we’ve got.  Unfortunately, ‘reform conservatism’ doesn’t yet seem to be up to the challenge of remedying the deficit of conservative contributions to the critically important climate policy debate. This article was revised to reflect that Manzi didn't misrepresent Nordhaus' research, he simply doesn't believe its conclusions."
"The problem with Pascal Husting is that he looks more like a person who flies to work than he does an employee of Greenpeace. In fact, he's both – Greenpeace's international programme director was exposed this week as a plane commuter – and that's what has fired another torpedo into the scull of the environmental movement. What, exactly, is the point of a campaign whose top brass cannot bring themselves to eschew the very behaviour they're campaigning against? Yet if there is one thing more depressing than a world-class environmentalist flying from Luxembourg to Amsterdam as a commute, it's how easy it is to set greens, deep greens and green-leaners against one another. The best way to never be a hypocrite, and to always stay consistent, is to deny climate change, and have no agenda on anything beyond self-interest. There's always a chance you'll fall foul of sexual morality, which is the only kind you will still admit into debate, but in every other realm, ethics need not trouble you. Indeed, the more ardently you pursue your own interests, the more persuasively you live your own values. If, on the other hand, you have ambitions for large-scale change and believe things could be significantly better for vast numbers of people, you will always fail fully to embody your own hopes.  It won't necessarily be by flying. You might buy your kid some trainers in Primark, or buy yourself clothes you don't need; you might eat meat. You might sometimes drive when you could take public transport, or take public transport when you could cycle. It will always be possible for someone not just to critique your choices, but also to critique them on the same terms, using the same measures, as you critique the choices made by society. To be entirely untainted by the flaws of civilisation, you would have to live outside it: off-grid, deep green, breathing some other air. This, however, would diminish your impact, because you would de facto be excluded from public life. The territory is knee-deep in the squelch of compromise, and nobody likes to dwell on this more than the people to whom the fact of climate change is in itself distasteful. I have sat in meetings while people from rightwing newspapers laugh at a Green politician getting a taxi home from a midnight TV interview – as if, for the audacity of believing things could be better, her whole life should be lived in penance. The assumption underneath is that self-interest is the baseline; anything more ambitious has to be paid for in sweat and tears. It would be good if we could rewrite that, so that hoping for better was a collective, not a personal, adventure, and self-interest was the thing that had to be constantly justified. Flying is in its own peculiar league, of course. If roughly a quarter of a person's carbon footprint is transport, then this is the easiest, most discretionary splurge, which is why greens have been campaigning against it for years. It's also extremely visible. When Rio+20 – the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development – took place two years ago, Ed Gillespie, author of Only Planet: A Flight-Free Adventure Around the World, said: ""I remember talking to a journalist from the BBC about it, and asking what her line was going to be. She said, 'How ironic that environmentalists from across the world have all taken a plane to get here.' I just thought, is that the best you can do?"" Greenpeace's problems run wider and deeper than one person's travel arrangements – Husting has now said he will take the train rather than the plane. The organisation recently lost £3m on currency speculation, which will be extremely difficult to explain to its mainly small-amount donors. Greenpeace has made a stab at an explanation already, which is that, since its donations mainly come in euros but were spent in other currencies, this left it ""highly exposed"" to fluctuations in the currency markets; exchange contracts protected them. It's unfortunate the protection came at such a high risk and with a price of its own. Greenpeace was behaving like a corporation which campaigns, and makes business decisions to protect its wherewithal for campaigning, rather than a charity with values. The former asks myopic questions about where to keep its euros safe; the latter would ask panoramic questions about the financial deals it did and whether there was a deeper message in the volatility. Charities are notorious for this, and have been for years: investing in businesses that work expressly against their beliefs; sinking their reserves into stock portfolios of arms and tobacco companies. It's as easy a target as a flying environmentalist, but a more proper one. When charities drop their standards and lose their capacity for self-examination, they traduce the values of the people who donate money to them. It's bigger than the misuse of funds; it's a mockery of the ideas that raised them. Compared with this, the sin of flying looks rather small. After all, it would be better if nobody flew. Environmentalists have never been perfect enough to silence their opponents – such perfection probably doesn't exist. The aim is to work towards better systems, not exist in this system as superior people. The greens have a new tone, distilled in Gillespie's book. ""I'm not asking you to give anything up; I'm asking you to rediscover something wonderful. You won't miss that airport if you dare to step out of it. You can get anywhere in Europe within 24 hours on a train; it puts the romance and adventure back into travel. There's certainly no romance in Stansted."" Or indeed Schiphol. Twitter: @zoesqwilliams • This article was amended on 25 June 2014 to correct the spelling of Schiphol airport. The subheading was amended on 30 June 2014 to clarify that the writer was referring to Greenpeace as a whole rather than to the charity."
"Why is e-waste an environmental problem? When recycling infrastructure is in place, e-waste is not an environmental problem. The problem arises when it is not treated correctly and this is a problem in developing countries.  Despite having highly effective informal networks for recycling, there is often no effective treatment for waste. The most predominant way of dealing with e-waste is to burn it to extract its valuable materials. This causes environmental and health problems. At Dell we are working towards the environmentally-sound management of obsolete electronics. Through our Take Back programme we are working to ensure e-waste is collected and reused rather than discarded and burned. Is the depiction of developing countries as 'dumping grounds'  for e-waste accurate? The view that developing countries are dumping grounds for e-waste is changing. If you look at the volumes of e-waste in Africa, it is not always the big brand technology companies that are doing the importing, even though it may be their products that end up as waste. Increasingly it is local importers in developing countries who are buying and importing second-hand electronic products from companies in other regions. Developing countries are actually generating more and more of the e-waste themselves. Do you think a lack of regulation is behind the problem?  Latin America and Africa are the main regions that remain unregulated. The big challenge is that there is a lot of e-waste regulation in developing markets, but it is very uncoordinated. When we talk to governments in Africa, one of the things we say is don't reinvent the wheel. Countries just need to tweak legislation so it works for their economy. The second issue is that the necessary infrastructure to support the legislation is often absent. Although you see these horrible pictures of sprawling e-waste in developing countries, not all of these countries have it in a volume that is going to encourage a big recycler to invest in building the necessary infrastructure. This is why we are saying they should work towards regional solutions. Through our work in east Africa we are seeing the first developments in infrastructure happening in Kenya. Let one country, such as Kenya, be the recycling base for other countries. Are there any issues around using the term 'waste'? The first thing I say when I speak at conferences is to say we have to stop talking about waste as 'waste' and start talking about it as a resource. In many developing countries, particularly those in Africa, the growth of the IT sector is key to development. People are looking for affordable solutions to bridging the digital divide. In Nigeria, we are providing IT access to children via a series of mobile solar classrooms, made from old shipping containers. Many people depend on recycling and sorting e-waste for an income. How do you balance the regulation with the possibility of job loss? We feel it is incredibly important that we recognise these jobs and try to formalise the work. The solution is starting out with embracing the informal sector – training those workers and teaching them how to handle e-waste properly. The idea is that you establish the view that all e-waste has value not just the valuable material that comes from burning it. Instead of only being paid for things like copper, informal workers would get paid for everything they collect. We trialled this in Mombasa and in a week collectors were happy to stop burning e-waste. What is the biggest misunderstanding about e-waste? The big misconception is that the best way of dealing with e-waste is to try and stop the waste coming in to a country, rather than focusing on solutions. We've seen a lot of countries ban the import of secondhand products thinking that they are getting 'waste'. This has a serious negative impact. Uganda has formally recognised the impact of this legislation on their ability to bridge the digital divide. Our commitment is still not to ship waste, but the most important thing for those countries is solutions. As long as there is a solution for waste, it can be managed: you can create value and you can create jobs. Jean Cox Kearns is the director of compliance at Dell. Follow @JeanCoxKearns on Twitter.

"The Anglican Church general synod has unanimously passed a motion urging the federal government to respect the science on climate change. Speaking at the gathering of Anglican diocese representatives in Adelaide, Bishop Tom Wilmot, of Perth, said the dismantling of the Climate Commission proved the Abbott government was not interested in the truth about climate science.  Actions taken by the government had instead worked to “denigrate science in general and environmental science in particular, which is being progressively starved of funding and excluded from important decision-making processes”, he said. The synod, which includes bishops, lay and clergy representatives from all 23 Australian dioceses, unanimously passed the climate-change motion presented by Wilmot. The motion states “with deep regret that it is future generations and other forms of life who will bear the real cost of our heavy dependence on carbon-based energy”. It stated as a “grave concern” that a national target of 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2000 level by 2020 was “well short of the response needed to the data presented in the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change”. The motion also called on individual Anglicans and dioceses to review their commitment to protecting the Earth. The general synod was not the first time Wilmot had spoken out about climate change. He wrote last year that many parishioners were deeply concerned about it and that “the church prays for our elected leaders on a regular basis”. But it appears the passing of the motion has done little to sway the environment minister, Greg Hunt. A spokesman told Guardian Australia: “We do fully accept the science. The problem with the carbon tax is that it has an adverse impact on families, whilst failing to significantly reduce emissions. “We therefore hope the Anglican church will agree that the Coalition’s approach of taking pressure off electricity prices and actually achieving a significant reduction in emissions is a far better policy.”"
