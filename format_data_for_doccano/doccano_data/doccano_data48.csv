"Ruth McLarty, an experienced surgeon, was fairly certain she was about to die in a particularly grisly way. Surrounded by a hellish inferno of burning trees and cars, McLarty reasoned the flames would engulf her long before the smoke could choke her to death. Trapped in nearby vehicles, some of McLarty’s colleagues made similarly macabre calculations. Two nurses, stuck in the back of a stalled police car, contemplated shooting each other. Another nurse rolled down her window and gulped in the smoke. McLarty edged her car away from a burning wreckage, fired off some final messages to her sister and called her daughter, who said she could hear the roar of the blaze over the phone.  “Once you feel heat, you know that your car can’t last very long,” said McLarty, a slight, deliberate woman who, little over an hour previously, was in a hospital conducting a gallbladder operation when she was told to evacuate. “You can hear other people’s cars blow up. I grew up thinking that when people died in fires, they died from the smoke and so they didn’t really suffer. But I’m thinking ‘this is coming fast enough … I don’t think that I’m gonna die from smoke.’” As McLarty arrived at this grim conclusion, a bulldozer emerged from the sun-blotting pall of smoke and shoved an abandoned car off the road, opening an escape path for McLarty and a few others to dart to safety in a nearby field. “This poor man. I mean, he’s just driving to his death, and they cleared a path,” McLarty said. “It was apocalyptic.” The bulldozer driver, she later found out, survived, as did others given just minutes to flee the incinerated town of Paradise, California, on 8 November. Heather Roebuck delivered her daughter by cesarian section at McLarty’s hospital and had to be dragged on a stretcher through thick smoke to safety. Brad Weldon somehow stopped flames devouring his home, aided by buckets, a hose and his blind and immobile 90-year-old mother. More than a dozen terrified people waded into a frigid reservoir, nearly succumbing to the cold while their neighbours were perishing in the heat. Still, the Camp fire is comfortably the deadliest in California history, with 85 confirmed deaths and a few dozen people unaccounted for. More than 50,000 others were scattered into refugee tent encampments, hotels, relatives’ couches. “We are a town in exile,” said Michael Orr, a Paradise resident now living on an air mattress at his in-laws’ house in Chico. Nine in 10 homes in Paradise have been reduced to clumps of ash, mixed with twisted metal, as if the settlement has been carpet-bombed by a brutal invader. Chimneys, like tombstones for a lost town, are the only things left standing. The birds fled along with the humans leaving Paradise an eerily quiet place with a lingering smell of charcoal. The visceral trauma of having a town wiped off the map is the nadir in an astonishing burst of recent wildfires – of the 10 most destructive fires in California’s recorded history, five have occurred since October last year. “The landscape is changing into the appropriate climate zone that we are moving towards,” said LeRoy Westerling, a climate change and fire expert at the University of California, Merced, who attempts to work out how wildfires will spread as temperatures continue to rise. “The fires seem to be outpacing our predictions. The Camp fire shocked me by how fast it was.” California is in the grip of what its governor, Jerry Brown, calls the “new abnormal”. The past five years have been the hottest on record in the state, which is in stuttering recovery from its worst drought in a millennium. The state has received just a fifth of its normal rainfall so far in 2018, with a record 1.6m acres of grassland, forest and urban area, an area larger than Delaware, burning this year. Of the multifarious consequences of climate change, scientists consider increasingly ferocious wildfires to be one of the most starkly apparent. Rising atmospheric heat – average minimum temperatures in California are 2.3F warmer than a century ago – is drying out trees and shrubs, drawing moisture away from the soil and shrinking the snowpack. Dampening rains are becoming erratic, or, like this year, not materializing at all. This creates a tinderbox for wildfires, which can ignite from actions as simple as sparks flying from a trailer dragging on the road or a faulty power line. There’s also evidence that climate change will help southern California’s autumn winds, known as Santa Anas or Diablos, fan wildfires. A 2016 study found climate change has doubled the total area burned in the western US since the 1980s. Something on the scale of the Camp fire, where a funnel of flame seared through a town in a few hours, could’ve conceivably occurred 50 years ago but it would’ve involved a “very unlikely sequence of climate events you wouldn’t see again”, Westerling said. “Now we are seeing it happen again and again, year after year,” he added. “The climate will continue to warm and will continue to surprise us. No one alive today will ever see a stable climate system again. This is going to be changing for the rest of our lives.” Firefighters now face a grueling workload that lasts all year, rather than tapering off in time for Thanksgiving. Last October, the Tubbs fire razed chunks of Santa Rosa, causing 22 deaths. It was swiftly followed by the Thomas fire, which burned a vast swath of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and primed the landscape for mudslides that killed more than 20 people. Then, during the Carr fire in July, the public was introduced to the terrifying concept of a fire tornado, or firenado, when a monstrous seven-mile high flaming column killed a firefighter, Jeremy Stoke, who was attempting to evacuate people on the edge of Redding. “A whole bunch of fires have piled on to the top of each other and haven’t stopped,” said Scott McLean, deputy chief of Cal Fire, who oversaw crews working 24-hour shifts during the fight to save Paradise. “I grew up in this state and you’d never really get fires like this in November or December. We’re now fighting fire all year round. There’s no fire season any more. People are tired. It’s a constant battle.” The situation is set to become worse. An exhaustive climate change assessment by the US government predicts the area of the western US consumed by wildfire annually is set to double, or even increase sixfold, within 30 years as the planet continues to warm. Confronted by the findings of his government’s scientists, Donald Trump bluntly stated, “I don’t believe it.” The president has, instead, blamed the “gross mismanagement of forests” in California, a state where the majority of woodland is overseen by the federal government. To add to the confusion, Trump, whose recent ecological pronouncements include “oceans are very small”, suggested “cleaning and raking” forests to prevent future conflagrations. Others in the administration argued the issue more conventionally. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary and former Navy Seal, recently visited Paradise and likened it to Falluja, the Iraqi city flattened during the second Gulf war. Zinke has blamed “radical environmentalists” for preventing proper management of the forests and has vowed to loosen rules to allow more intervention. Decades of fire suppression by firefighters has interrupted the natural cycle of forest regeneration, allowing fuel to build up and ignite in huge blazes. During the Ronald Reagan administration, the government spent a few hundred thousand dollars on firefighting – this year it could top $4bn. The idea of “thinning” the forest to reduce this fuel, however, is viewed suspiciously by many ecologists who see it as a euphemism for logging that can make wildfires more rampant. “It may make donors some money but it won’t do anything to help communities facing the dangers of wildfires,” said Westerling. There’s agreement, at least, that rustic settlements need to adapt – better building materials to resist flying embers, moats of cleared vegetation around houses, widened roads to act as firebreaks. One in three Americans now live among forested areas, with many of them drawn to scenes similar to Paradise – an affordable enclave nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, a bucolic patchwork of almond farms and vineyards. The more complicated question is what to do when things start to go awry, when fires and floods spurred by climate change force growing numbers of Americans to flee their homes. Rebuilding is under way in Santa Rosa following the fires last year, but “for every building going up you see about 10 lots empty and another 10 for sale,” admitted Shirlee Zane, supervisor of Sonoma county. “Climate change is here and affecting us in catastrophic ways.” Jody Jones, Paradise’s mayor, has vowed the town will “rise from the ashes”, but when you stand in the muddy surrounds of Walmart in Chico, where 75 bedraggled tents full of Paradise evacuees continue to stand, it’s clear that the phenomenon of climate refugees won’t be restricted to places such as Bangladesh and far-flung Pacific islands. “A lot of people are desperate,” said Naomi Larae, who had nowhere else to turn to other than the encampment, known in a sardonic nod to Hollywood as “Wallywood”, and has suffered the indignity of having her tent stolen. Back in Paradise, the town twice mistakenly called “Pleasure” by Trump, Ruth McLarty sifted through the remnants of her home. Her daughter rescued her laptop, as well as the dog and parakeet, but the clarinet and piano are just cinders now, the sofa merely springs. McLarty picked up one of the few surviving items, a mug with “Hawaii” emblazoned on it, only for the handle to split off in her hand. “It’s just surreal, you don’t really know what to think, how to process it,” she said, plucking a blackened bowl from the ashy detritus that was once her kitchen. “Do I even bother to try to stay? So much is lost and it will take so long to repopulate. I really don’t know. I just can’t see the future right now.”"
"Two months ago, the UN’s climate change panel warned that unless humanity takes drastic action, we will only have 12 years to save the planet from disaster. But will we? Representatives from almost 200 nations are currently meeting in the Polish coal-mining town of Katowice to try to turn the pledges made in Paris in 2015 into a political reality. There are, with children in Australia walking out of school to protest the climate inaction, signs of generational optimism. On the other hand, we have Donald Trump dismissing his own government’s climate report, while the incoming Bolsonaro administration is refusing to host next year’s climate talks in Brazil. There is still time to save the world but at the moment, Robin McKie writes, a climate catastrophe looks inevitable – and everywhere will be affected. With the White House actively uninterested in the process in Poland, a key role will fall to Obama’s “climate diaspora” – a group of former state department climate officials now working in the private sector who are doing all they can to protect the goals agreed in Paris. In a fascinating piece, Karl Mathiesen profiles the likes of Sue Biniaz and Todd Stern, who are trying to save the Paris accord from their own president. As Emmanuel Macron sat with other G20 leaders in Buenos Aires, the group of tax protesters known as the gilets jaunes held a third weekend of demonstrations. The violence in France brought the government to crisis point. The battle with the “yellow vests” is the biggest challenge to Macron since he took office last May, writes our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis. We also look at who the protesters are, what they want – and how French fuel costs (the catalyst for the uprising) compare to those in the rest of Europe. Elsewhere this week, there was a detente in the ongoing trade battle between the United States and China. Our economics editor Larry Elliott warns that, with protectionism playing well with US voters, carmakers shouldn’t count their chickens. In Honduras, the killers of environmental activist Berta Cáceres were found guilty and, in Germany, a trio of candidates are lining up to replace Angela Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats. In our culture pages, Hadley Freeman meets the world-conquering cr​eator of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who’s been practising his estuary English accent for Disney’s reprise of Mary Poppins – and Ryan Gilbey looks at the legacies of two recently deceased filmmakers, Nicolas Roeg and Bernardo Bertolucci, and asks how they compare in modern eyes.  Finally, for most of the planet, it would be an easy question – would you give up ​​membership of a golf club for £85,000 ($108,000)? Things aren’t that simple for the wealthy members of one south London club, whose next-door neighbour – the home of the Wimbledon Championships – has made a final, final offer to buy them out. Will they take it?"
"There is a 75-80% chance of a climate-warming El Niño event by February, according to the latest analysis from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization. The last El Niño event ended in 2016 and helped make that year the hottest ever recorded by adding to the heating caused by humanity’s carbon emissions. The 2019 event is not currently forecast to be as strong as in 2016.  El Niño events occur naturally every few years and stem from abnormally high ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific. They have a major influence on weather around the globe, bringing droughts to normally damp places, such as parts of Australia, and floods to normally drier regions, such as in South America. The high temperatures also cause major bleaching on coral reefs. “The forecast El Niño is not expected to be as powerful as the event in 2015-2016,” said Maxx Dilley, the director of WMO’s climate prediction and adaptation branch. “Even so, it can still significantly affect rainfall and temperature patterns in many regions, with important consequences to agriculture and food security, and for management of water resources and public health. It may also combine with long-term climate change to boost 2019 global temperatures.” Forecasters in the US have already warned of an imminent El Niño. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in October that a dry, hot summer was very likely, with increased risk of heatwaves and bushfires and no relief for already drought-stricken farmers. There is evidence that climate change is making the effects of El Niño more severe. The heat boost from El Niño helped 2016 to be the hottest year ever recorded. The following year, 2017, was ranked equal second, but was the hottest for a year without an El Niño. Scientists expect 2018, which saw climate-related disasters around the globe, to be the fourth hottest on record. Billions of tonnes of carbon emissions are continuing and greenhouse gases are at record concentrations, meaning their heating effect is stronger than ever. But whether a new El Niño will help make 2019 a new record remains to be seen. “The developing El Niño conditions are likely to contribute to warmer global average temperature in 2019 – it is a little too early to say whether or not it will be a record year,” said Tim Stockdale, at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. In any case, human-caused global warming has resulted in 17 of the 18 hottest years recorded since 1850 occurring between 2000 and 2017. Scientific analyses have shown that many extreme weather events have been made more severe or more likely by climate change. The WMO analysis estimated the chance of a fully-fledged El Niño event between December 2018 and February 2019 at 75-80%, with a 60% chance of it continuing to April 2019. A strong El Niño sees western Pacific sea surface temperatures reaching at least 1.5C more than average. Current model predictions for the imminent El Niño range from 0.8C to 1.2C above average. • This article was amended on 4 December 2018. El Niño is associated with warmer water in the eastern Pacific, not the western Pacific as an earlier version said."
"What’s not to like about Luxembourg’s plan to make public transport free from next summer? This, surely, is just the kind of radical action the world needs if we are ever to escape the tyranny of the motor vehicle and make our cities green, pleasant and quieter. Just imagine being able to hop on and off buses, trams or trains at will, without scrabbling around for coins or tickets. Picture the reduction of traffic that would surely result from shifting the incentives so dramatically: the buses whizzing down uncongested streets, the less stinky air and less stress-inducing crossings, without the queues of cars pressing to squeeze through before the light turns red, their impatient drivers huffing and honking and swearing.  The proposal from the tiny (600,000 people) European country’s newly elected government, a coalition including Greens and led by the Democratic party’s Xavier Bettel, is not so much the habit-altering “nudge” popularised by behavioural economics as a giant shove. Stop driving! And in Luxembourg this makes sense. Its capital suffers some of the worst traffic congestion in the world. People under 20 already travel for nothing. Of course, the city’s buses and trains will still cost money to run (salaries of drivers and managers; fuel; vehicle purchase and maintenance). But rather than people paying for this with tickets, the system will be funded via some form of taxation. Tallinn in Estonia already operates a similar scheme. Aside from the health and local environmental benefits of such a policy, which could include an economic dividend if Luxembourg becomes a more desirable place to live and work, policies that discourage driving also reduce carbon emissions. With around a quarter of European emissions due to transport, 70% of which are from road traffic, it is tempting to jump up down and demand that Europe’s bigger capital cities should follow suit. If there is a catch – and I think there is – it concerns walking and cycling. Pedestrians sit atop any road user hierarchy that is focused around sustainability and safety (such as that employed by the London Plan, until former mayor Boris Johnson changed it). This is because walking is the greenest form of transport there is, and pedestrians are vulnerable travellers. Cycling comes next, followed by public transport. It follows that a green transport policy must encourage walking and cycling, by altering road layouts, signposting routes and providing cycle storage facilities, as well as discouraging unnecessary car journeys and terrifyingly vast heavy goods vehicles. The risk with offering free public transport to a population already overly habituated to sitting down is that, rather than stroll, people take the bus. Still, it’s great to see Luxembourg adopting what, in a small and trafficky country (2,500 square km, around the same size as Dorset), sounds like a rational scheme. Transport planning may sound dry, technical, dull. In a more sensible, evidence-driven world perhaps it would be. But the reality is that it is a ferociously contested area, with the different constituencies (principally motorists and cyclists) pitted against each other in a national conversation that has turned transport into a branch of identity politics. Carbon emissions and more localised forms of air pollution aren’t the only reasons for this. Nor are road crash statistics that show outcomes for drivers improving while other groups lag behind. The awkward fact, for those of us who would like to see their use drastically curtailed, is that cars and motorcycles are experienced by many people as uniquely useful and liberating. Cotten Seiler, in his book Republic of Drivers, shows how they are hardwired into 20th-century capitalist, liberal individualism. Affordable fuel is widely seen as a right and a necessity. The gilets jaunes protests in France are a striking example. Champions of affordable public transport, by contrast, are often on the left – though rarely are their demands as rousing as in Brazil, where fare rises have sparked mass demonstrations. Earlier this week my daughter was excited to see the green Lamborghini that has taken up residence in our unassuming neighbourhood backing into its regular space. We agreed to sidle past and attempt to meet the driver, both hoping (we admitted later) to be offered a ride. The ploy failed as he didn’t get out. I mention it by way of an illustration that there is something about cars that people find attractive – especially, if you are nine, brightly coloured luxury ones. Good luck to the Luxembourgers trying to persuade people to take the bus or tram instead. • Susanna Rustin is a leader writer for the Guardian"
"Two decades ago, Canada’s westernmost province was in the midst of environmental and economic calamity. A small beetle was devouring large swathes of the region’s valuable pine forests, leaving millions of trees dead as infestation spread. The government waited anxiously for cold winters – which would kill the beetles – but year after year the cold never came. By 2008 the decimation of the forests, along with a series of intense storms walloping the province, prompted British Columbia to take action on climate change. The provincial government introduced a carbon tax, putting a price on fossil fuel emissions. And, crucially, all the money raised was returned to the people in tax cuts. “It was groundbreaking,” said Karen Tam Wu of the Pembina Institute, an environmental thinktank. “It was the first one in the world that was revenue neutral.” A decade later, as climate scientists and policymakers converge on UN talks in Katowice, Poland, urgently seek mechanisms to rein in carbon emissions in a bid to halt the inexorable rise of global temperatures, the British Columbia experiment with the tax is setting an example to others. Economists and environmentalists have voiced support for it; the World Bank has called it a “textbook” way of developing environmental policy. Earlier in October, the economist William Nordhaus, winner of this year’s Nobel Prize for economics, threw his support behind the British Columbia model as an ideal model for export to other economies. British Columbia is a province known for its environmental lean: yoga and hiking are the region’s main cultural exports. For many Canadians, it seems fitting that the continent’s most progressive carbon tax would originate amid mountains, surf and forest. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com But the man who helped to usher it in, the former premier Gordon Campbell, rejects the notion that love for the environment is unique to the region. “If you talk to people in rural communities, in urban communities, in Ontario or Alberta, and they all care about the environment,” Campbell told the Guardian. “They all want to go to pristine places.” Troubled by the compounding effects of climate change he saw both at home and abroad, Campbell and his government believed a carbon tax represented the most effective way to address the problem – and it wasn’t a time to point fingers. “Are we willing to do something to try to stop [climate change] from taking place, to slow it down?” he said. “Even for people who say: ‘It wouldn’t matter, Canada could have all of the emissions in the world and it wouldn’t make any difference.’ That’s not the point. We should do our bit.” It’s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word The carbon tax isn’t anything new. The world’s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than €20 ($22/£18) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive oversupply of permits and a price crash to €3 in 2013 – far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the price back above €20 in recent weeks. China has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. Its carbon market is being established and will, on completion, be the world’s biggest. In the world’s second biggest polluter, the US, 10 east coast states have had a “cap and trade” system for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax, but with little success. Many fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently spent $13m (£10.22m) in helping to defeat a proposal in Washington state. In the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has legislated to impose a carbon levy on reluctant provinces, generating a storm of opposition. Ontario’s premier Doug Ford, who recently repealed the province’s carbon tax, has called it “the worst tax ever”. “It’s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word,” said Wu. “It’s really a key tool in the toolkit to incentivise the transition to a low carbon economy and curb carbon pollution. In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.” Nonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: 88 nations, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon. By design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions. In everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers. The tax was leading edge at the time. And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it’s still leading edge But the critical selling point of the plan – the tax’s revenue neutral design – was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it – close to $1.8bn in its first three years – back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. As a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black. “The nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn’t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you’re going to pay more tax,” Campbell said. “People who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.” Low-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits. The tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province. The move – the first of its kind – placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked. “We saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,” Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect. Fears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country. “It was leading edge at the time,” Campbell said. “And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it’s still leading edge.” By 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents. In Victoria, the province’s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases – a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. “Look, I’d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.” For others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. “Money talks,” said resident Kim Hollingsworth. “People need incentives to change their behaviour.” She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates – part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced. The revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions. Others felt it was too onerous: between 2012 and 2016 Campbell’s successor as premier, Christy Clark, froze the tax and repealed a number of environmental policies. “When the carbon tax was frozen, we saw emissions go back up,” said Wu. By 2021, the tax is slated to reach $50/ton, but the current British Columbia government is examining modifying the revenue-neutral aspect of the programme in order to allocate funding for green infrastructure, deviating from its original revenue neutrality – a move Campbell feels defeats the purpose of the tax in the first place: “I’m not happy when we say it’s going to be revenue-neutral carbon tax and it isn’t really. Don’t play that game with people.” He remains optimistic that the current feud in the country will dissipate over time. Too many people, he says, are on the defensive, feeling the problems of climate change are not directly their fault. “I think the relevant question is: are we willing to do something about it when it’s happening?” he said. “And if we can help, are we willing to?” The numbers that are fuelling international concerns about global warming and climate change are stark. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a third over the past 100 years, to more than 400 parts per million. That has happened as a result of sharp rises in annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which have roughly doubled since 1971, to 53.5m tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. (CO2 from industrial processes and from forestry and other land uses makes up about three quarters of greenhouse gases; methane comprises another 16% and nitrous oxide about 6%). Annual global emissions flatlined for three years from 2014-2016, but rose sharply again last year. Meanwhile, over the past century, average global temperatures have risen more than 1C. The one bit of good news is the exponential rise in renewable power supplies, which have surged over the past 20 years to comprise more than 8% of global electricity generation. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, signatories are supposed to rein in carbon emissions so as to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the 1.5C threshold is now looming, mechanisms for implementing Paris are still weak, and many observers are predicting that rises of 3C or more are now far more likely by the second half of this century.

"This month, hundreds of children are going on strike from school to demand urgent action on climate change. From rural Victoria to Townsville, we are walking out of school for a day or more to tell our politicians to listen to us and protect our futures. We are Milou, Jean and Harriet and we are 14 years old.  Two of us – Milou and Harriet – live in rural Victoria. Throughout our lives, we’ve witnessed the impacts that drought, bushfires and extreme weather have on a community. We have been forced to evacuate when a bushfire came through our town. It was scary. But it is something that will happen more and more as climate change gets worse. We feel frustrated and let down when we think about the climate crisis and our future. There is so much our politicians could be doing that they aren’t. It seems they are in denial. Our government is supposed to protect us, not destroy our chances of a safe future. Climate change doesn’t only affect our environment. It affects our physical and mental wellbeing. Milou’s mum is a psychologist and she knows how much something like a bushfire can threaten everything a person cares about. It’s hard to hold on to dreams for the future when we don’t know what that future holds. We feel hurt when we hear people say that we can’t think for ourselves because we’re still children. This is just an excuse not to listen to us. We are perfectly capable of thinking for ourselves. We deserve to be heard and understood. As kids, we can’t yet vote or run for government, however scientists say there’s only about a decade left for us to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. By the time our generation is making decisions, it will be too late. We’re striking from school to push for urgent change now. We were inspired after seeing 15-year-old Greta from Sweden in the newspaper. She’s striking every Friday to put climate change in the spotlight in her country. Australia is even more vulnerable to climate change impacts, which is why we are doing the same here. We are also inspired by the stories of other kids in our community’s history who did big things to stand up for their values. Jean goes to Fort Street high and in the 60s, kids from her school went on strike to protest the war in Vietnam. They took a stand to help stop the atrocity. Young people have always been part of big movements for social change, and we intend to be the same. None of us want to grow up in a world where dangerous bushfires and crippling droughts are normal, where we struggle through extreme heatwaves, and where young people lose their homes to sea level rise. We are often told to count our blessings. We feel lucky to live in such caring communities. But, when we think of all our blessings, it also makes us want to cry. The idea that our children and grandchildren may not get to experience the beautiful world that we live in, is one of the saddest things we can think of. We want to live in a world powered by 100% renewable energy. We don’t want massive new coalmines like Adani’s that will wreck the climate and our future. Although we love school and learning, we love our family, friends and community more. And we will do anything to ensure all of us have a safe planet to live on. So, we are striking from school to save our future, and the futures of the people we love and those not yet with us. ""We might not be able to vote, but we have rights. We have a right to a future.""

You cannot continue pretending we are not here, and that climate change is OK. Because we are here. The climate crisis is here, and it is destroying our planet. People’s lives and livelihoods are on the line. We have trusted you to do what is in the best interest of our country, and it is clear to us that you aren’t doing enough. At the end of November, we are going on strike together with kids from across Australia to get our voices heard. We’re giving up our education for a day to learn more about climate change, experience how to make a difference, and demand our politicians take urgent action on the most important issue of our time.

"On Sunday morning hundreds of politicians, government officials and scientists will gather in the grandeur of the International Congress Centre in Katowice, Poland. It will be a familiar experience for many. For 24 years the annual UN climate conference has served up a reliable diet of rhetoric, backroom talks and dramatic last-minute deals aimed at halting global warming. But this year’s will be a grimmer affair – by far. As recent reports have made clear, the world may no longer be hovering at the edge of destruction but has probably staggered beyond a crucial point of no return. Climate catastrophe is now looking inevitable. We have simply left it too late to hold rising global temperatures to under 1.5C and so prevent a future of drowned coasts, ruined coral reefs, spreading deserts and melted glaciers.  One example was provided last week by a UN report that revealed attempts to ensure fossil fuel emissions peak by 2020 will fail. Indeed the target will not even be reached by 2030. Another, by the World Meteorological Organization, said the past four years had been the warmest on record and warned that global temperatures could easily rise by 3-5C by 2100, well above that sought-after goal of 1.5C. The UK will not be exempt either. The Met Office said summer temperatures could now be 5.4C hotter by 2070. At the same time, prospects of reaching global deals to halt emissions have been weakened by the spread of rightwing populism. Not much to smile about in Katowice. Nor will the planet’s woes end in 2100. Although most discussions use the year as a convenient cut-off point for describing Earth’s likely fate, the changes we have already triggered will last well beyond that date, said Svetlana Jevrejeva, at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool. She has studied sea-level rises that will be triggered by melting ice sheets and expanding warm seawater in a world 3-5C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and concludes these could reach 0.74 to 1.8 metres by 2100. This would be enough to deluge Pacific and Indian Ocean island states and displace millions from Miami, Guangzhou, Mumbai and other low-lying cities. The total cost to the planet could top £11trillion. Even then the seas will not stop rising, Jevrejeva added. “They will continue to climb for centuries even after greenhouse-gas levels have been stabilised. We could experience the highest-ever global sea-level rise in the history of human civilisation.” Vast tracts of prime real estate will be destroyed – at a time when land will be needed with unprecedented desperation. Earth’s population stands at seven billion today and is predicted to rise to nine billion by 2050 and settle at over 11 billion by 2100 – when climate change will have wrecked major ecosystems and turned farmlands to dust bowls. Unfortunately many experts believe Earth’s population will actually peak well beyond 11 billion. “It could reach 15 billion,” said Sarah Harper, of Oxford’s Institute of Population Ageing. “All sorts of factors suggest women, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, will still want to have relatively high numbers of children and this might keep the world’s population approaching 15 billion rather than 12 billion.” The world will have double its present numbers – but with hugely reduced areas of fertile land to provide food. We will be living in a shrunken, scorched planet bursting with human beings. Somaliland gives a grim vision of this future. In the past few years climate change has killed 70% of its livestock and forced tens of thousands of families to flee from its scorched interior to live in refugee camps. “You can touch it, the climate change, in Somaliland. It is real. It is here,” the country’s environment minister, Shukri Ismail Bandare, said in the Financial Times last week. Sudan and Kenya are also victims of a drought that has dried the Horn of Africa faster than at any other time in the past 2,000 years. Similarly, in Vietnam, thousands a year are abandoning the once fertile Mekong Delta as rising seawater pollutes paddy fields. By 2050, the World Bank says more than 140 million will become climate refugees. It will be bad for humans, but catastrophic for Earth’s other inhabitants. Arctic ice loss threatens polar bears, droughts imperil monarch butterflies, and koala habitats are being destroyed by bush fires. In all, about a sixth of all species now face extinction, say scientists, although in the end no creature or plant will be safe. “Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall victim as extreme stresses drive ecosystems to collapse,” said Giovanni Strona of Europe’s Joint Research Centre in a report last week on climate change. Scientists warned more than 30 years ago that such a future lay ahead, but nothing was done to stave it off. Only dramatic measures are now left to those seeking to save our burning planet, and these can have grim political consequences. In France, for example, President Macron’s new levies on fossil fuels, introduced to cut emissions and to fund renewable energy projects, triggered riots. Had only modest changes been enacted a few decades ago there would be no trouble today, say analysts. But the most telling example is provided by the US, which has emitted about a third of the carbon responsible for global warming. Yet it has essentially done nothing to check its annual rises in output. Lobbying by the fossil fuel industry has proved highly effective at blocking political change – a point most recently demonstrated by groups such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Heartland Institute, which helped persuade President Trump to pull out of the Paris agreement, thus dashing the planet’s last hope of ecological salvation. “The coalition used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up,” said the environmentalist Bill McKibben in the New Yorker. “As a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the Earth.” No region of the US has more to lose from climate change than southern Florida. If scientists’ worst predictions are realised, an entire metropolitan area, currently inhabited by more than six million people, is likely to be swamped by a 1.5-metre sea-level rise before the end of this century, a rise that could see the tourist mecca of Miami simply disappear. It’s a doomsday scenario that has united the leaders of Miami-Dade county and the cities of Miami and Miami Beach in an attempt to find solutions to the most severe effects of rising oceans before it is too late. Their plan to combat the physical, economic and social challenges of climate change, as part of the global 100 Resilient Cities programme, will play a key role in determining whether the low-lying region will still be habitable in the coming decades or surrendered to the ever-rising Atlantic. “It’s a problem that can be managed, it’s not a problem that can be fixed and you walk away from,” said Susanne Torriente, chief resilience officer for Miami Beach, where hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars have already been spent elevating roads, constructing higher sea walls and investing in modern, high-capacity pumps and stormwater drainage systems. “Every generation will add to the work that we have begun,” Torriente says. “We are always learning, it’s a constant process of learning, re-evaluating and improving.” Up to a million Florida homes, worth an estimated $371bn (£290bn, are at risk of tidal flooding by 2100, one recent study calculated, but the threats facing the greater Miami region are not just coastal. Hurricanes are becoming more powerful because of global warming, say scientists, who point to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Michael in October, while the combination of a low water table and high “king” tides – occurring in autumn – causes regular inland flooding even on dry days. This means that the new joint action plan being worked on by city and county officials has to be further-reaching than anything that has preceded it, Torriente says. “Our resilience journey began with the climate work, the storm water, [but] this strategy will be much broader and will be defining resilience not only in terms of climate and flooding, but also mobility and housing, property, and how to recover quickly in the event of a hurricane in south Florida.”  These moves reflect the sense of urgency being felt in Florida, where the state leadership has been criticised for neglecting the environment. Its newly elected senator, Rick Scott, banned staff from using the term climate change during his time as governor of Florida, and will be a close Washington ally of President Donald Trump, who took the US out of the Paris climate agreement. “We’ll be much more successful if we have more cooperation and more attention at all levels of government, [because] it’s a problem for all of us,” Torriente says. “But we do what we can. Everything we are doing is funded locally, so we can continue to invest.” Richard Luscombe, Miami It’s a 45-minute canoe journey along the coast from regional capital Morombe to Kivalo in south-west Madagascar. Children frolic in the water, palm trees sway, and fishing nets hang along the beach. This tranquillity is deceptive, however – for Madagascar is ranked as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures, extended drought periods in the south, intensification of cyclones and rising sea levels are all forecast. For good measure, the country’s pervasive poverty restricts its capacity to adapt to such changes. In Kivalo, this is already a familiar picture. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until July,” says Bikison Thomas, a fisherman. “But it’s still going now in November.” On very windy days, he cannot put out to sea. “There is also more fog,” he adds. Overfishing, higher sea temperatures and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for fish stocks, are also reducing catches. The Madagascar government is aware of the country’s vulnerability and has ratified the Paris agreement. Climate change is listed in every major policy document but budgets usually fall short of producing effective measures, a point that is demonstrated dramatically down the coast in the town of Morondava, where hotels are grappling with sea-level rise. Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought the Coco Beach hotel. It had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly added more bedrooms, a reception area and a restaurant. But in September, powerful tides destroyed two of his bungalows, and the sea has not returned to its previous level. “We used to have 150 metres of beach,” he says bitterly. “Now it’s minus five.”  Although there are plans to build sea defences, Badouraly says that could take months, even years, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands and built a 60-metre-long sea wall, a mixture of stone blocks, steel rods and sandbags. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad,” he adds. “I would never have bought.” Emilie Filou, Madagascar It is hard to get a grip of the sheerscale of the Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica. It’s more than 300 miles long and 200 wide – and more than a mile thick. It drains an area of ice that is larger than England and stealthily slides towards the sea by several metres every day. Only from satellite images have we understood the shape and power of this ice monster. These now show the beast is waking up. Thwaites’s uptake of falling snow was once matched, fairly finely, by snow and ice being lost as icebergs. Now it has begun to flow faster, along with some of its neighbouring glaciers. More ice is being lost into the ocean than is being replaced, speeding up global sea-level rise. The cause of the disruption at Thwaites is straightforward, researchers have discovered. Increasing amounts of warm ocean water coming from the north have been melting the floating parts of the glacier and this, in turn, is letting the inland glacier run more quickly into the sea. This much we know, but we have still to understand how this process is likely to accelerate. At present, Thwaites contributes around 4% of observed sea-level rise, but it is widely agreed that this could grow exponentially. Indeed, some glaciologists believe that a complete collapse of the Thwaites glacier over coming centuries is now inevitable – and that would raise global sea level by several metres, drowning coastal ecosystems around the world, damaging coastal investments and displacing millions of people. Research on the ice and frigid waters around Thwaites Glacier is urgently needed but carrying that out is tough. Even by Antarctic standards, this area is cold and remote. I have been working in Antarctica for more than 30 years, and I’ve never managed to reach Thwaites. However, the UK and US governments have agreed to send in scientists as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. We are finally going to get the chance to understand this waking monster. At the moment, it is merely yawning and stretching. The question we must answer, urgently, is whether it is about to wake up and roar. David Vaughan, British Antarctic Survey Coral reefs cover a mere 0.1% of the world’s ocean floor but they support about 25% of all marine species. They also provide nature with some of its most beautiful vistas. For good measure, coral reefs protect shorelines from storms, support the livelihoods of 500 million people and help generate almost £25bn of income. Permitting their destruction would put the planet in trouble – which is precisely what humanity is doing. Rising sea temperatures are already causing irreparable bleaching of reefs, while rising sea levels threaten to engulf reefs at a faster rate than they can grow upwards. Few scientists believe coral reefs – which are made of simple invertebrates related to sea anemones – can survive for more than a few decades. Yet those who have sounded clear warnings about our reefs have received little reward. Professor Terry Hughes, a coral expert at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, recently studied the impact of El Niño warmings in 2016 and 2017 on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest coral reef and its largest living entity – and wept when he saw the damage. “The 2016 event killed 30% of corals, the one a year later killed another 20%. Very close to half the corals have died in the past three years,” he said recently. For his pains, Hughes has faced demands from tourist firms for his funding to be halted because he was ruining their business. “The Australian government is still promoting new developments of coal mines and fracking for gas,” Hughes said, after being named joint recipient of the John Maddox prize, given to those who champion science in the face of hostility and legal threats. “If we want to save the Great Barrier Reef, these outdated ambitions need to be abandoned. Yet Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are rising, not falling. It’s a national disgrace.” This grim picture is summed up by the ethnographer Irus Braverman in her book Coral Whisperers: “The Barrier Reef has changed for ever. The largest living structure in the world has become the largest dying structure in the world.”"
"As the world’s leaders converged on Katowice, Poland, for this year’s UN climate change conference, the mood was sombre. How could it be anything other, when in the opening keynote one of the world’s foremost naturalists said we were all pretty much doomed? While the numbers do not make for happy reading, there are plenty of people trying to do something about them. Our reporter Leyland Cecco writes this week from the Canadian west, where the province of British Columbia has come up with an innovative response to the global carbon splurge.  Luxembourg, meanwhile, has come up with a different idea for tackling greenhouse gas emissions (and city tailbacks), following an example set two years ago by Tallinn, as our Europe correspondent Daniel Boffey found out. Pioneering startups are playing their part in using technology to combat environmental degradation. In France, Morphosis aims to reduce e-waste – discarded old electronics – by making sure their rare metals are recycled and reused. In Cameroon, Save Our Agriculture improves food security through aquaponics, a farming method where fish nourish the plants that in turn filter their water. And in the UK, a small army of ramblers is determined to push back against human incursions into the countryside by rediscovering long-lost footpaths buried under decades of manmade eyesores. Just what we need: new ways to get lost. In Greece, marine divers are volunteering to clear the surrounding oceans from plastic litter. With the longest coastline in the EU, they are slowly but surely reclaiming their natural habitat, NPR reports. The charity Beam is trying to get the UK’s homeless population back into employment through crowdfunding. Candidates are referred by homelessness charities, and Beam then mentors each one to develop a career plan, which the public can fund via their website, receiving updates on their training and progress. Finally, a US-based startup, Ecovative, is harnessing the power of the humble mushroom to create natural, biodegradable packaging and materials for potential use in industry.

"The Trump administration is rolling back a climate change regulation that restricted new coal plants. The change is mostly symbolic – but nevertheless sends a strong signal. Companies in the US are not building plants that burn coal because burning natural gas is cheaper and creates less pollution. Renewable power has also eaten into coal’s market share. But the Obama-era rule for new coal plants has long been a target of the industry. It would have effectively required technology to capture the carbon dioxide that traps heat on earth and causes climate change. That technology is not in use on a commercial scale. A draft replacement rule would allow new coal plants that meet certain efficiency requirements. The acting Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the Obama administration was “disingenuous” when it decided coal-plant carbon capture technologies were adequately demonstrated. He said the change to require efficiency efforts instead of carbon capture will encourage “clean coal” in the US and worldwide through technology exports. “You will see a decrease in emissions worldwide because of an increase in investments in new energy technologies,” Wheeler argued. The EPA’s own economic analysis contradicts him. It concludes that the rollback will not do anything to boost coal power in the US because any new fossil fuel plants will burn natural gas, not coal. Wheeler argued affordable energy benefits low-income people most and invited the National Black Chamber of Commerce to speak as a supporter. Experts say, however, that coal plants are shutting down because they aren’t as affordable as other options. Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of the coal industry group the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said ahead of the event that “there is no silver bullet when it comes to developing new coal units in today’s marketplace but in announcing this proposal the EPA has outlined a regulation that both follows the law and allows new more efficient coal plants to be a viable option in the future.” Nixing the rule could invigorate coal backers worldwide, sending a message to negotiators of an international climate pact in Poland that the US is trying to bolster the future of the fossil fuel. Trump, who has questioned manmade climate change, has said he will exit that pact, the Paris agreement. David Doniger, a climate director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move “will be judged harshly by future generations”. “The science is clear: operating large fossil fuel plants without carbon capture and storage is a disaster for the climate. What we need instead is swift and decisive action to curb dangerous climate change,” Doniger said. Fifteen health and medical groups, including the American Lung Association, opposed the EPA announcement. Across the federal government, Trump agencies have sought to slash rules for fossil fuel production and use. The environmental protection agency is also rescinding an Obama rule that aimed to shift the US away from coal use and toward more natural gas and renewable power. And the agency is expected to roll back a standard requiring coal plants to limit their toxic mercury pollution. Many plants shut down in 2015, in part so that they wouldn’t have to spend money to comply with that rule. This year, coal use in the US is expected to be at its lowest point since 1979, according to the energy information administration. Coal consumption has fallen 44% since its peak in 2007, the agency said."

"People in rich nations will have to make big cuts to the amount of beef and lamb they eat if the world is to be able to feed 10 billion people, according to a new report. These cuts and a series of other measures are also needed to prevent catastrophic climate change, it says. More than 50% more food will be needed by 2050, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) report, but greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture will have to fall by two-thirds at the same time. The extra food will have to be produced without creating new farmland, it says, otherwise the world’s remaining forests face destruction. Meat and dairy production use 83% of farmland and produce 60% of agriculture’s emissions.  Increasing the amount of food produced per hectare was the most critical step, the experts said, followed by cutting meat-eating and putting a stop to the wasting of one-third of food produced. “We have to change how we produce and consume food, not just for environmental reasons, but because this is an existential issue for humans,” said Janet Ranganathan, vice-president for science and research at the WRI. Tim Searchinger, of the WRI and Princeton University, said: “If we tried to produce all the food needed in 2050 using today’s production systems, the world would have to convert most of its remaining forest, and agriculture alone would produce almost twice the emissions allowable from all human activities.” The new report, launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, follows other major scientific analyses showing that huge reductions in meat-eating are “essential” to avoid dangerous climate change. Another found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce  an individual’s environmental impact on the planet, from slowing the annihilation of wildlife to healing dead zones in the oceans. The world’s science academies concluded last week that the global food system was “broken”, leaving billions of people either underfed or overweight and driving dangerous global warming. Another new report concluded that the global food system required “radical transformation” if climate change and development goals were to be met, including “widespread dietary change”. After increased productivity, the WRI report focuses on meat from ruminant animals. The digestion of cattle and sheep produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Beef provided 3% of the calories in the diet of US citizens but was responsible for half the emissions, the WRI said. The report recommends that 2 billion people across countries including the US, Russia and Brazil cut their beef and lamb consumption by 40%, limiting it to 1.5 servings a week on average. Most of the world’s citizens would continue to eat relatively little beef in the WRI scenario. But Searchinger said: “The world’s poor people are entitled to consume at least a little more.” The 40% reduction is a smaller cut than in other studies. “We think that is a realistic goal,” he said. “In the US and Europe, beef consumption has already reduced by one-third from the 1960s until today.” Tobias Baedeker, of the World Bank, said farmers would require a lot of support to make the changes required but that redirecting the world’s huge subsidies could be a “game-changer”. Subsidies of more than $590bn (£460bn) a year are given to farmers in 51 nations, representing two-thirds of global food output, according to the OECD. In the US, these subsidies halve the current price of beef, the WRI says. The sophisticated marketing and behaviour-change strategies that food companies already used to influence customers could help shift diets, said Ranganathan, as could governments encouraging less meat in schools, hospitals and other public institutions. Other changes to farming that are needed, according to the WRI, include better feed to reduce methane production from cows, limiting biofuels made from food crops, managing manure and fertiliser better and cutting energy use by farm machinery. It also said the overall demand for food could be cut, with policies to curb population growth such as “improving women’s access to education and healthcare in Africa to accelerate voluntary reductions in fertility levels”. The WRI report was launched at the UN climate summit in Poland where almost 200 nations are aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set out in Paris in 2015 into reality. The rapid ramping up of action is another key goal. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN."
"Standing on a tube platform, Miriam González Durántez’s article (May has added insult to the injury of Brexit, Journal, 29 November) made me cry. Growing up in the north-east of England during the 1970s, I did not get to meet many foreigners as a child, so any opportunity I had to make contact with someone from somewhere different was deeply exciting. Now, living in London, surrounded by difference, it is no less exciting, and I am enthralled as I have ever been by different ways of living and thinking. Having worked for 20 years looking after international students, I was deeply distressed by the Brexit vote and shocked by the increasing horrors of the “hostile environment” policy. An additional sadness is that my 21-year-old son, who has grown up among friends from all around the world, has lost at a stroke his right to live and work in the rest of Europe. But that is not the only thing he has lost: the trebling of tuition fees in 2010 wiped out the money we had been carefully saving to give him at 18, and saddled him with a £50,000 debt. But those two political blunders pale into insignificance beside the damage inflicted on his generation by the comprehensive failure of all governments to address the existential threat of climate change and halt the destruction of life on earth. That is when I really weep.Alison GarnhamChigwell, Essex  • The news that – at last! – the government plans to increase the number of young non-EU doctors allowed to work in the UK under the medical training initiative (MTI) is very welcome (Report, 30 November). We also learn that, sensibly, numbers on the MTI are not counted as part of the immigration total, as they form part of an exchange scheme in sharing knowledge and experience. That is exactly as it should be, but it raises the question: why on earth are university students counted in the immigration total? Surely the same logic should apply to them? The current immigration panic could be much reduced.Prof Peter Ekkehard KoppHull • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil face a shareholder challenge to set carbon targets in line with the Paris climate agreement, as a green group seeks to repeat its success in pressuring Shell to set environmental benchmarks. When Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, laid out an ambitious long-term carbon target last year, he acknowledged the role played by a resolution on carbon targets submitted by Dutch activist shareholders Follow This.  Follow This is hoping to use investor power to push other major oil and gas firms into setting similar goals.  The organisation has bought shares in several major fossil fuel groups and has submitted two resolutions to the European firms BP and Shell. It will file identical resolutions with the US companies Chevron and ExxonMobil later this week if other parties do not submit a similar demand. Investors at the firms’ annual general meetings next year will be asked to vote in favour of them publishing climate change targets in alignment with the international goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures well below 2C. Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said: “Targets should be on the agenda of every oil company, given that the oil industry can make or break the Paris climate agreement.” The group has little chance of winning by persuading a majority of the four companies’ shareholders to back the resolution but it believes the tactic can put public and investor pressure on firms. Although backed by the Church of England and major pension funds, the resolution filed for Shell’s AGM on carbon targets failed in 2017, with 94% of shareholders voting against and 5% abstaining. When Van Beurden set the firm’s carbon goals last year, however, he said the firm had seen a kernel of truth in the proposal. Van Baal said: “We expect that the investors who supported the Shell resolution will also support the resolution with the other companies and that more investors will start to participate.” The resolutions will ask firms to set goals that account for their biggest contribution to global warming – the emissions produced when consumers burn the oil, which are known as scope 3 emissions. That is considered an important step beyond oil companies just cutting emissions from their own operations. For BP that would mark a significant step up from the carbon curbs its chief executive, Bob Dudley, announced earlier this year, which explicitly ruled out counting emissions from the burning of its products."

"Brazil has abandoned plans to host crucial UN climate talks in 2019 amid growing signs of the anti-internationalism of the new government being formed by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro. The foreign ministry announced the reversal in a message to Patrícia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Climate Change, according to the O Globo news website.  Two months after winning the bid to host the COP25 conference in 2019, the note said Brazil would withdraw its offer to stage the event due to the transition in government and budget restrictions, the paper said. The decision is a blow to global efforts to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Brazil, which is home to the the world’s biggest rainforest, the Amazon, has been an important player in international climate talks. Its sudden weakening of support comes just days before the opening of this year’s climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The Climate Observatory NGO said Brazil had abdicated its role in one of the areas where it was most needed by the world and its own people. “By ignoring the climate agenda, the federal government also fails to protect the population, hit by a growing number of extreme weather events. These, unfortunately, do not cease to occur just because some doubt their causes,” the group said in a statement. “It is not the first and certainly will not be the last bad news of Jair Bolsonaro for that area.” The broken promise is in line with the anti-globalist rhetoric of the far-right former army captain, who was elected president in October and will take power in January. He threatened to quit the Paris climate agreement, then subsequently backtracked, but has made no secret of his desire to open up the Amazon to mining, farming and dam building. He has also aligned himself closely to Donald Trump. Earlier this month he choose a new foreign minister who claims “climate alarmism” is part of a cultural Marxist plot and who said the United Nations has no language for “love, faith and patriotism”. The shift has been abrupt. Just two months ago – shortly before the election – the foreign ministry said Brazil’s offer to host the COP25 talks “confirms the country’s leadership role in sustainable development issues” and “reflects the consensus of Brazilian society on the importance and the urgency of actions that contribute to the fight against climate change”, according to the O Globo news website.

"Arriving in the village of Kivalo in south-west Madagascar after a boat ride of about three-quarters of an hour through beautiful mangrove from the nearest land point, is a bit like stepping out of time. Children frolic in the water. Palm trees sway in the ocean breeze. Chickens run between thatched huts as fishing nets hang by the beach, ready for the next outing. It feels like very little has ever changed here. Yet this tranquillity belies the enormity of the change ahead. Few countries are more vulnerable to climate change than Madagascar, the location of which – in the Indian Ocean, off the south-east coast of Africa – leaves it hugely exposed. The island nation’s pervasive poverty and lack of economic development also severely restrict its capacity to adapt to climatic shifts.  Broadly speaking, the main changes experienced by Madagascar will be rising temperatures, extended drought periods, as seen in the south, greater variability in rainfall, the intensification of cyclones – cyclone Enawo, in 2017, was the most destructive in 13 years – and rising sea levels and sea temperatures. In Kivalo, much of this is already familiar. “The southern wind used to start in January and last until June or July,” says Bikison Thomas, a local fisherman. “But it’s still going now [ in November].” On very windy days, fishermen cannot go out to sea. “There is also more fog, which makes it difficult to leave early in the morning,”says Thomas. Other factors are also contributing to reduced catches, not least overfishing and the loss of mangrove, a crucial habitat for the regeneration of fish stocks. Further down the coast, in the city of Morondava, hotels and restaurants in the seaside neighbourhood of Nosy Kely are grappling with another effect of climate change: sea-level rise. Two years ago, Chayune Badouraly bought a hotel there, the Coco Beach: it had a few bungalows and a lovely beach. Badouraly then built a new building with bedrooms, a reception and a restaurant. But in September, during the powerful equinox tides, the sea destroyed two of his five bungalows. The water level has not returned to its original level since. “We used to have 150m of beach, now it’s minus five,” he says, bitterly. “I knew we had coastal erosion problems, but I didn’t think it would be that bad. I would never have bought.” The government of Madagascar is well aware of the country’s vulnerability. It has ratified the Paris climate agreement and climate change is listed in every major policy document. Budget allocations usually fall short, however, says Jane Razanamiharisoa, director of adaptation at the National Bureau for the Coordination of Climate Change. “As part of the consultation for the national adaptation plan, we have lobbied about the importance of getting the ministry of planning and budget involved, so that decision-makers can factor climate change in the budget,” says Razanamiharisoa. The government is also piloting adaptation projects in key sectors, but Razanamiharisoa believes that, for Madagascar to boost its resilience, climate change must become embedded in policy “in every sector, and at every level: national, regional and local”. Although there are plans to build sea defences in Morondava, Badouraly says it could take months, even years for anything to materialise. Since September, the sea now laps right up against the new buildings, so he’s taken the problem into his own hands by building a 60-metre long sea defence wall from stone blocks, steel rods and sand bags. “Everything we earn goes there,” says Reza Vally, Coco Beach’s manager. In Kivalo, WWF is piloting the development of beekeeping and ecotourism. The initiatives offer alternative revenues to fishing and protect the mangrove by making it the cornerstone of the new activities. The organisation estimates that 80% of mangrove destruction in the area is due to human factors, and 20% to climate change; rising sea level and less rainfall means increased salinity levels and more silting in mangrove areas. “There is nothing we can do about [climate change factors], but we can work on the human factors,” says Eli Todimanana, capacity building offer at WWF Madagascar. Despite the new activities being far removed from anything they had ever done, the villagers have embraced the opportunity. The village now has 12 hives, kept in a secure enclosure, and they have had two honey harvests over the past year. Since different species of mangrove trees flower at different times of the year, Todimanana says they could have up to four harvests a year once they master the art of beekeeping. “Can you imagine? Fishermen converted to beekeepers, that’s quite something,” he says. “They have tough lives: they leave at 4am to fish, come back by midday; then they must look after their nets. It’s quite hard to fit in other activities.” The village has also started receiving tourists, making the best of its postcard location. There are pirogue tours, crab-fishing excursions in the mangrove and meals cooked by local women. WWF has provided training and technical support throughout. Justin Rakotomanahira, a local fisherman and president of Kivalo’s village association, says the new activities have been like a window to the world: “It’s allowed us to meet new people and learn new skills, which we’ll be able to pass on to our children. Fishing is our life but, given the current pressures, this move [to other activities] is really important.”"

"UK and US insurers are lagging far behind European firms when it comes to divesting from coal-heavy businesses and refusing to insure them, campaigners have warned. At least 19 major insurers holding more than $6tn in assets – a fifth of the industry’s global assets – have now divested from coal, according to a report from the Unfriend Coal campaign, which represents a coalition of a dozen environmental groups including Greenpeace, 350.org and the Sierra Club. This is up from $4tn – equivalent to 13% of global assets – that were covered by coal exclusion policies a year ago. The study rates 24 of the world’s biggest insurers on their efforts to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry. A growing number of insurers are taking action, faced with mounting losses from disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, whose frequency and severity has increased due to a warming climate. Global losses reached $337bn last year, including insured losses of $144bn. The report found that Europe’s four biggest insurers have restricted insurance for coal. Germany’s Allianz and Italy’s Generali limited underwriting this year, while French firm Axa tightened its policy further. A third of the global reinsurance market has also restricted cover for coal, with the reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re limiting their underwriting this year. UK insurers, though, have made less progress than European firms. Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market, has done nothing to encourage its syndicates to stop insuring coal or sell their coal investments, the report said, although it excluded coal from the investment strategy for its own central fund in April. Lloyd’s said: “The Lloyd’s market is made up of more than 50 insurance companies that run almost 100 syndicates between them. These insurance companies each have their own investment policies. It is not the corporation’s role to set investment strategy for the market, although we think that by showing leadership in this area, others in the Lloyd’s market and wider insurance sector will be encouraged to follow.” Aviva and Legal & General are focused on engaging with coal companies to create change, and only sell their coal holdings in exceptional circumstances. Neither provides insurance to coal companies, but Aviva is one of the top investors in the Polish coal industry, whose plans to build more than 7 gigawatts of new coal power are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Unfriend Coal. Unfriend Coal’s campaign coordinator, Lucie Pinson, said trying to engage with coal companies was “a waste of time” and that cutting financial ties with them was the only way forward. Across the Atlantic, none of the nine leading US insurers have taken any action. In Japan, there are the first signs of change, as three large life insurers – Nippon Life, Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda Life – have announced they will no longer fund new coal projects. Globally, Allianz is the only company that has pledged to cut its financial ties with coal companies completely by 2040, by stopping both underwriting and insuring in coal.  The UK insurance broker Willis Towers Watson warned in September that “finding alternative sources [of coal insurance] is likely to become increasingly challenging – especially if North American insurers begin to follow the European lead”. The Unfriend Coal report is being presented to insurers at an insurance and climate risk conference in London, and as the UN climate change conference gets under way in Poland on Monday."

"Talk about cognitive dissonance. Just two days before 13 federal agencies released a report laying out the devastating human and economic toll that climate change already is taking in the United States, Donald Trump tweeted: “Whatever happened to global warming?” The tweet was based on a spurt of cold weather in the north-east, never mind that the rest of the world was experiencing higher than normal temperatures. The administration was so concerned about what the report, called the National Climate Assessment (NCA), would reveal – including the fact that the president’s thinking on climate change is hopelessly flawed – that it chose to release it on Black Friday, hoping no one would pay attention. A member of Trump’s transition team, Steven Milloy, was candid about this strategy, saying: “Do it on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day’s news.” Fortunately for the Earth and its residents, news coverage about the report continued over the weekend and into the following week. So, what was Trump trying to hide? The fact that global warming’s effects are here and now. When western state residents say that recent wildfires are unlike anything they’ve experienced before, there’s a reason for that. Climate change doubled the area burned by wildfires across the west between 1984 and 2015, relative to what would have burned without warming, according to the report. And when coastal residents say that decades ago, they weren’t splashing through flooded streets on sunny days, there’s a reason for that, too. Sea level rise has increased the frequency of high tide flooding by a factor of five to 10 since the 1960s for some communities. US residents (and, of course, people all over the world), are now being forced to cope with dangerously high temperatures, rising seas, deadly wildfires, torrential rainfalls and devastating hurricanes. If carbon emissions continue unabated, life will become much more difficult. By the end of the century annual losses in some sectors are projected to exceed $100bn and surpass the gross domestic product of many states, according to the NCA. However, we can avoid these damages by embarking on the lower emissions scenario, reducing costs by nearly 50% in the labor sector and nearly 60% in the extreme heat mortality sector. While the report doesn’t offer policy recommendations, its findings certainly make the case that the administration must stop rolling back the climate policies the previous administration put in place, including standards requiring vehicles to go farther on a gallon of gas and rules that would limit carbon emissions from power plants. The report will also make it much harder for the Trump administration to defend these rollbacks in court: judges don’t like it when policymakers ignore authoritative science. Though Trump has stalled progress at the federal level, he doesn’t control what states, cities and the private sector do. All have stepped up to fill the void left by the Trump administration’s abdication. For example, states across the country are implementing policies that curtail global warming emissions, either out of concern over climate change or because the policies make economic sense. California is leading the pack with a recently passed law targeting that the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045. Texas, with its steady winds and large open spaces, is ranked number one in wind energy generation in the US, generating more wind energy than all but five countries. State leaders there had the foresight to invest more than $7bn in transmission infrastructure to connect those open areas to population centers. And sunny North Carolina is powering half a million homes with solar thanks to state incentives, renewable portfolio requirements, investments by utilities and solar energy purchases by large in-state firms such as Apple and Ikea. The midterm elections bode well for continued progress at the state level. In New Mexico, Maine, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, gubernatorial candidates who pledged to advance science-based clean energy and climate action won their races. Even in Washington DC there are signs that the pendulum has begun to swing back, with voters deciding to end one-party rule in Congress. The House of Representatives’ new leadership plans to hold hearings on the president’s efforts to dismantle climate rules and young voters who have mobilized around climate issues plan to hold Congress’s feet to the fire, pushing Democrats to make climate legislation a priority this year. The lesson for Trump and his supporters is that you can only ignore science for so long – eventually it catches up to you. And people around the country are realizing that we are now deep into it and climate impacts will only get worse without action. State and private sector action is helpful; national action is essential. Let’s just hope that enough federal decision-makers get the message soon. The NCA makes it clear that time is the most precious commodity of all; we are running out of it. Ken Kimmell is the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists and the former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environment.

" The hillside groves of eucalyptus trees that tower over the Santa Cruz shoreline would, not so long ago, be teeming with monarch butterflies at this time of year. Boughs would be bent under the weight of black and orange clusters, as hundreds of thousands of the magical invertebrates nestled into the leaves, waiting out the frost on the California coast before returning north.  Now, on a sunny December afternoon the boardwalk that weaves through the monarch preserve, at Natural Bridges State Beach, is filled with school children craning necks and straining eyes to catch a glimpse. The monarchs are there – but they are harder to spot. Just two years ago, 8,000 overwintered here, but these days, just more than a thousand are fluttering amidst the Santa Cruz trees. It’s part of a troubling trend: over the last two decades monarch numbers in the West have declined by roughly 97%. “It is a sad reality of climate change,” said Anthony Gutierrez, a volunteer guide at the park and biology student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, as he takes a break from guiding school children through a tour. “For every little thing that changes there’s not just one consequence – it’s a whole chain reaction.” According to the Xerces Society, a conservation organization, in the 1980s between 10 million and 4.5 million monarchs spent the winter in California. The last count, conducted annually by volunteers each November, showed that in 2018 there may be as few as 30,000 across the state – a number that’s 87% lower than just the year before. “We had a lot of reason to suspect that it was going to be a bad year, but we were shocked at just how bad,” said Xerces Society Conservation biologist Emma Pelton. She said that year-to-year fluctuations can be expected, but this kind of continuous drop-off is cause for concern. “It is in the context that the population has already declined 97%. So, it’s OK if you have millions of butterflies and they drop down a little bit – that’s not a huge deal. But if you have 200,000 butterflies to begin with and you have a bad year? Now we only have 30,000 left.” While researchers can’t pinpoint the direct cause for each annual decline, there are several factors cited for the overall loss in numbers. For years, western monarchs have faced habitat loss in both the places they breed and where they spend their winters and increased use of pesticides has also taken a toll. Climate change, of course, has also played a role. Both drought and severe weather are deadly stressors for the butterflies, that are already under siege. Monarchs aren’t alone. As the New York Times noted in a recent article on the “insect apocalypse,” researchers in Germany found flying insect populations there had decreased by up to 82% over the last three decades. A collection of separate studies showed that the populations of most of the insect species included, had been nearly cut in half. The indirect effects of this massive disappearance – considered as part of the sixth extinction – are still unknown, as is the scale of just how massive this die-off might be. Most insect populations aren’t closely watched. “That is a disturbing thing,” biologist Emma Pelton said. She added: “They are definitely not the ones people are even the most worried about, which says something” Anurag Agrawal, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at Cornell University, suggests that the butterflies are like the canary in the coal mine. In a blog about his work, he said that because they travel across North America every year, monarch migration can be helpful in determining the “health of our entire continent”. But saving them could require big changes. “We have to take a step back and ask ourselves the harder questions that none of us want to deal with.”He said monarchs are “are exhibiting multi-decadal declines that point to very big systemic problems. We shouldn’t fool ourselves”. Samantha Marcum, a Coastal Program Regional coordinator for the US Fish and Wildlife Service agrees. “Monarch declines give us a clue to the health of ecosystems across North America and declines are being detected across many other pollinator species as well,” she said. But, she added, her agency has been teaming up with researchers and organizations to find solutions and strengthen protections. Along with restoration of monarch habitat – which she said also provides benefits to threatened bumblebees, honeybees, and grassland birds – the department has implemented management plans to plant trees that protect the delicate invertebrates from harsh weather. It has also planted native nectar plants, and has worked with the agricultural industry and communities to eliminate or reduce the use of pesticides. “Everyone can help to reverse the decline of monarch butterflies,” she said. “The public can participate in citizen science projects to monitor breeding monarchs or to estimate overwintering monarch numbers in the western US. People can plant native nectar plants and milkweed, where appropriate, that are not treated with pesticides.” For now, researchers will be looking to next year’s numbers to see if the efforts can help turn the decline around. It is still possible for the butterflies to bounce back. Glen Cornett, a retired math teacher who now volunteers at the Natural Bridges grove, said he’s hopeful, as he guides children to a scope pointed at a cluster of monarchs. “[Volunteering] is a chance to … raise awareness about what it’s going to take to bring the migration and the monarch population back up again.” “If I wasn’t a volunteer I would like to be paid by each ‘wow!’ from the kids.” Before packing up his scope he looks up at the butterflies fluttering through the speckled afternoon sunlight. “It’s just perfection.”"
"Olafur Eliasson is putting the chill into climate change. The revered Scandinavian artist has placed 24 large blocks of centuries-old ice, harvested from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord in Greenland, in a circle outside the Tate Modern in London, with another six on display in the City. The purpose of Ice Watch London, a collaboration with award-winning Greenlandic geologist Minik Rosing, is to bring the effects of climate change closer to home, putting people in direct contact with its effects so that they can feel – and even sniff and lick – the ice as it slowly melts away. “I’ve been studying behavioural psychology, and looking into the consequences of experience,” says the Icelandic-Danish artist. “What does it mean to experience something? Does it change you or not change you? It turns out that data alone only promotes a small degree of change. So in order to create the massive behavioural change needed [to tackle climate change] we have to emotionalise that data, make it physically tangible.” Each ice block was fished out of the sea after it had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet – then transported in fridge containers to the UK (“Just like the ones that take your frozen prawns to Selfridges,” grins Rosing). The blocks, which weigh between 1.5 and 6 tonnes each, all have to be of a shape that is unlikely to break – when Ice Watch was on display in Copenhagen and Paris, the public were fond of scrambling up and sliding down the blocks. Of course, such interaction is the point of the project. As Eliasson puts it: “Roll around on it, climb on it, listen to it!” The icebergs are made up of compressed snow rather than frozen water, meaning that each block contains tiny little bubbles of air. Put your ear up against them and you will hear a magical popping and fizzing sound. “It sounds so beautiful,” says Rosing. “That is air that was trapped before we started polluting the atmosphere. Those bubbles have almost half the CO2 content as the air outside the iceberg. It was trapped maybe 10,000 years ago, maybe 100,000, so you can smell what air used to smell like before we polluted it. And you can take a drink of it, beautiful, natural water.” The artwork arrives here to coincide with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest stark warning that we have only 12 years to limit the worst effects of climate change. Eliasson and Rosing both point out the rather chilling statistic that 10,000 blocks of ice such as the ones on display in London are falling from the ice sheet every single second. However, they both passionately believe that focusing on scare stories is the wrong way to tackle climate change. “Instead of fear-based narratives, you need a positive narrative to make people change their behaviour,” says Eliasson, “and that’s why I think the culture sector has a strong mandate to take on some leadership here.” “We have to provide a glimpse of hope,” adds Rosing. “People think the scientists come with the bad news about climate change but actually we come with the good news. We understand what’s happening, we know exactly what needs to be done and we actually have the means to fix it. The only reason we’ve been able to upset the global environment system is because we have enormous power. If we direct that same enormous power to improving the system, we can get it back on track.” Eliasson’s is perhaps best known here for his 2003 Tate Modern installation The Weather Project, which hung a gigantic sun in the gallery’s turbine hall and attracted over two million visitors. His work has often focused on environmental themes: Green River used uranine, a non-toxic dye, to turn rivers in Stockholm, Tokyo and LA a dazzling bright green, while his Little Sun project provided small, solar-powered lamps to local entrepreneurs in communities where electricity was scarce. Even during the installation of this latest work, which started on Monday, Eliasson says his ice blocks have had an unusual effect on people: “The crane guy outside who was lifting and putting them down said ‘You know what? These are actually really heavy!’ Another woman touched it and said ‘wow, it’s really cold!’ Of course she knew this but the knowledge of her hand is so different to the knowledge in our heads.” Ice Watch is set to run until 21 December, providing the weather doesn’t melt them away before. After that date, any ice left unmelted will be taken to local community and cultural institutions as part of an extended educational programme. The exhibition comes before a major retrospective of Eliasson’s work at the Tate Modern that starts on 11 July 2019. That, too, will have a climate focus, perhaps inevitably so given Eliasson’s longstanding interest in environmental matters. For the catalogue, he has interviewed Elke Weber, the psychologist whose research into human behaviour has shaped his recent thinking about how to change people’s actions through art. The show will also contain a work from 20 years ago, in which Eliasson flew over Iceland documenting glaciers from above with a camera. “It’s one of my oldest works, but also one of the first where I was focusing on the question of climate and glaciers,” he says. “And now,” adds Rosing, striking a rare forlorn note, “those glaciers will probably be gone.” • Ice Watch London continues until the ice melts, details here"

"As four of the world’s largest oil and gas producers blocked UN climate talks from “welcoming” a key scientific report on global warming, Australia’s silence during a key debate is being viewed as tacit support for the four oil allies: the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait. The end of the first week of the UN climate talks – known as COP24 – in Katowice, Poland, has been mired by protracted debate over whether the conference should “welcome” or “note” a key report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC’s 1.5 degrees report, released in October, warned the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 45% by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5C and potentially avoid some of the worst effects of climate change, including a dramatically increased risk of drought, flood, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The UN climate conference commissioned the IPCC report, but when that body went to “welcome” the report’s findings and commit to continuing its work, four nations – the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, all major oil and gas producers – refused to accept the wording, insisting instead that the convention simply “note” the findings. Negotiators spent two and a half hours trying to hammer out a compromise without success. The apparently minor semantic debate has significant consequences, and the deadlock ensures the debate will spill into the second critical week of negotiations, with key government ministers set to arrive in Katowice. Most of the world’s countries spoke out in fierce opposition to the oil allies’ position. The push to adopt the wording “welcome” was led by the Maldives, leader of the alliance of small island states, of which Australia’s Pacific island neighbours are members. They were backed by a broad swathe of support, including from the EU, the bloc of 47 least developed countries, the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean, African, American and European nations, and Pacific countries such as the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Australia did not speak during the at-times heated debate, a silence noted by many countries on the floor of the conference, Dr Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on previous IPCC reports, told Guardian Australia. “Australia’s silence in the face of this attack yesterday shocked many countries and is widely seen as de facto support for the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait’s refusal to welcome the IPCC report,” Hare said. Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said widespread goodwill across the Katowice talks was being undermined by “a handful of countries” trying to disconnect the science and urgency from the implementation of the Paris agreement. “It is disappointing but not surprising that Australia kept its head down during the debate … by remaining silent and not putting a position forward, Australia has tacitly supported the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia’s rejection of the latest science on climate change.” Merzian said Australia’s regional neighbours, including New Zealand and Pacific islands, had voiced strong support for the IPCC’s report, which was a key outcome of the Paris agreement. “A number of delegates privately shared their frustration that countries like Australia stood on the sidelines while Trump’s, Putin’s and King Salman’s representatives laid waste to the fundamental climate science.” Hare said the interests of the fossil fuel industry were seeking to thwart the conference’s drive towards larger emissions cuts. “The fossil fuel interest – coal, oil and gas – campaign against the IPCC 1.5 report and science continues to play out in the climate talks, but even those countries [opposing welcoming the report] are being hit by the impacts of only one degree of warming. “The big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week.” Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, arrived in Katowice on Sunday, with negotiations set to resume Monday morning. “The government is committed to the Paris agreement and our emissions reduction targets,” she said before leaving Australia. “Australia’s participation in the Paris agreement and in COP24 is in our national interest, in the interests of the Indo-Pacific region, and the international community as a whole.” Price said a priority for Australia at COP24 was to ensure a robust framework of rules to govern the reporting of Paris agreement targets. “Australia’s emissions reporting is of an exceptionally high standard and we are advocating for rules that bring other countries up to the standard to which we adhere.” The latest Australian government figures, released last month, show the country’s carbon emissions continue to rise, at a rate significantly higher than recent years. Australia’s emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter. Excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (for which the calculations are controversial), they are at a record high."

"My crumbly crew are having coffee at the community centre after its annual carol concert and Charlie hits his usual glass-half-empty note. Trouble is, he’s right. Goodwill seems pretty thin on the ground nowadays, wherever you look. Wars and rumours of wars, famine, drought, fires, floods, plagues among the people, pestilence among the beasts, it’s all beginning to sound a tad apocalyptic. An end time has begun, or so it seems.  End time is something on which we elders have authority: reminders of its imminence fill our days. As a life with any future purpose evaporates, dissatisfaction with the present becomes my lingua franca as I acknowledge my redundancy. I become, like Charlie, querulous and fault-finding as I lose touch with the world, its language, its mores, and its business. However, if I am honest, I am faced with a most inconvenient truth. If social literacy has morphed into narcissism, if civic ethics have been exchanged for consumer loyalty cards, that’s my doing, because today’s world is yesterday’s creation and I am yesterday’s man. I am responsible. But these are minor issues, a form of displacement activity to shield me from acknowledging my contribution to a darker crisis, for which my generation is largely responsible: the human obsession with growth, comfort and convenience that has poisoned the air, contaminated the seas, intoxicated the soil and barbarised its creatures. Nowhere is our hubris better illustrated than by our describing the crisis as a planetary issue. It isn’t the planet that’s in crisis, simply its top predator. Our fellow inhabitants of Earth are praying for the end of the Anthropocene era – which is surely better described as the androcene, in recognition of its primary authority. We have been here before. Our species spent 200,000 childhood years refining the social contract as subordinate residents. Then, around 17,000 years ago, we experienced our first episode of global warming when the thaw ended the ice age. It produced the same degree of societal and elemental chaos that will occur this time. We emerged to dominate the globe as tooled-up owner-occupiers. The next stage of our evolution will hopefully empower us as adults to be custodial tenants of our exuberant planet. This is an evolutionary moment and how we address this prospect will be our legacy and that’s where the crumbly perspective may be of use, because I am experiencing on a personal level what our species is facing on a global dimension. When my end comes, my legacy for those who survive me will depend on the manner in which I departed, either as curmudgeonly life-denier or gracious celebrant. I should confront the dying of my light, not with rage, but with gratitude to a generous planet and remorse for my profligacy. Goodwill should be my legacy: like a dog, goodwill is for life, not just for Christmas, and I should bow out benevolently. This will not avert the end time but it may inform the mindset of the next epoch of our remarkable species and earn it the right finally to be called sapiens.  • Stewart Dakers is an 80-year-old voluntary community worker"
"A record-breaking heatwave in north Queensland will further increase above-average marine temperatures, heightening the risk of another coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef next year, scientists say. Dozens of record November temperatures have been recorded in the region, most along the reef coastline, this week.  The most remarkable was at Cairns, where consecutive days reached temperatures of 42.6C and 40.9C. The maximum temperature on Tuesday broke a November record that has stood since 1900 by 5.4C. Extreme weather fuelled more than 130 bushfires, which the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Twitter was “not the kind of fire we have seen in Queensland before”. “Heatwave records and fire weather is unprecedented,” Palaszczuk said. A dust storm, brought by strong westerly winds, covered the southern inland parts of the state. In the north, thousands of native flying foxes died due to the high temperatures. Reef scientist Terry Hughes, from the coral centre of excellence at James Cook University, said the summer heatwave was “terrifying” and lifted the chances of coral death on the Great Barrier Reef early next year. This is terrifying. An early summer heatwave breaks all records, lifting the chances of another episode of coral mortality on the #greatBarrierReef next Feb/March. https://t.co/NQkoKhGW5P The reef sustained successive marine heatwaves, in the early part of 2016 and 2017, which killed corals and badly damaged the northern and central sections. Hughes said the bleaching forecasts were “trending upwards” but scientists would not have a clear picture until the end of January. Coral ecophysiologist Dr Neal Cantin, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said ocean temperatures remained below those recorded at the same time in 2015 and 2016, but warmer than historical averages. Cantin said the current heatwave would “add heat and warm up the ocean. It certainly adds heat to the system. We’ve seen record breaking land temperatures this week, which we expect to see into the future with climate change and everything heating up. “We’re in a watch phase. There’s definitely the potential and how the local weather patterns pan out in January and February will really determine whether we get a large scale bleaching event or not. “There are some signs we may avoid [bleaching] this summer. At this stage it’s less likely to be as bad as 2016, but we’ll be ready to respond [if bleaching occurs].” “The hazard I worry most about is heatwaves,” Andrew Gissing, a disaster management expert from the firm Risk Frontiers, said. “Australia needs to be better prepared for heatwaves, with climate change we are already predicting they will get more severe.” Gissing told Guardian Australia people often respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters based on their previous experiences. But he said governments, businesses and individuals were often not prepared for the increasing severity and frequency of such events. “We did a lot of work in Lismore after Cyclone Debbie. So many people sheltered in their homes because that’s what they always did when it flooded. They just didn’t realise this flood was that much bigger “People really need to be attuned to what’s actually happening ... how the nature of climactic hazards is changing.” Gissing said businesses needed to start investing in climate change mitigation and adaption measures. “It’s going to be very hard to mitigate a lot of the [predicted climate] impacts, so adaptation for the future is going to be really important. Especially when you overlay climate change on a growing population base. “The [number of people living on the Queensland coast] is likely to double by about 2030. Because of climate change, we’re looking at there being more exposure [to disaster risks] there as well.”"
"School students protesting climate change have arrived in Canberra after the prime minister told them to be less activist and go back to school. Hundreds of students lined up outside Parliament House on Wednesday wanting to speak to Scott Morrison and government ministers about taking emergency action against climate change. On Tuesday, the Senate approved a motion to support the students in their decision to strike from school and hold a series of planned national protests. Students across the country plan to leave school this week, with protests in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart scheduled for Friday.

On Wednesday, Steele-John, Labor MPs Ged Kearney and Julie Owens, and Centre Alliance MP Rebehka Sharkie also met the students to hear their concerns. • #MyClimateQuestions: experts and youth leaders answer your questions about climate change and political action"

"People’s health is being damaged today by climate change through effects ranging from deadly heatwaves in Europe to rising dengue fever in the tropics, according to a report. Billions of hours of farmwork has been lost during high temperatures and global warming has damaged the ability to grow crops, it said.  The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change was produced by 150 experts from 27 universities and institutions including the World Health Organization and the World Bank. “The findings are clear and the stakes could not be higher,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general. “We cannot delay action on climate change. We cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.” The report sets out the impacts of global warming on health in stark terms. ”A rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease, and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,” it said. Nick Watt, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said: “These are not things happening in 2050 but are things we are already seeing today. We think of these as the canary in, ironically, the coalmine.” On Tuesday the UN said action to cut carbon emissions must be tripled to avoid catastrophic warming. International climate change negotiations were due to resume on Monday in Poland. The Lancet report said the lack of progress “threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to overwhelm health services”. A survey in the report of leaders of almost 500 global cities found half expected their public health infrastructure to be seriously compromised by climate change, meaning systemic failures such as the shutdown of hospitals.  A heatwave in Europe this summer was linked to hundreds of premature deaths in the UK alone. MPs said in July that the UK was “woefully unprepared” for heatwaves. The Lancet report says populations in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are at higher risk than those in Africa and south-east Asia because of the high proportion of vulnerable and elderly people living in cities. As temperatures rise across the world, the report says 157 million more vulnerable people were subjected to a heatwave in 2017 than in 2000. Hot conditions directly damage health via heatstroke, but dehydration and exacerbation of conditions such as heart disease are also very dangerous. Heat also worsens air pollution and mental health problems. Prof Kristie Ebi, of the University of Washington, said: “Increased mortality in extreme heatwaves is happening now [but] there is abundant evidence that communities are not prepared for the ongoing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves.” The Lancet report said 153bn hours of work were lost in 2017 due to extreme heat, 80% of it in agriculture. Almost half the losses were in India, equivalent to 7% of its total working population, while China lost the equivalent of 1.4% of its workers. “This has led to vast losses for national economies and household budgets,” said Prof Joacim Rocklöv of Umeå University in Sweden. Relatively small changes in temperatures and rainfall could cause large changes in the transmission of infectious diseases spread via water and mosquitoes. The ability of the dengue fever virus to be transmitted – its “vectorial capacity” – reached a record high in 2016, according to the report, 10% above a 1950s baseline. The danger from cholera risk was also rising in regions such as the Baltic states where the sea has been warming rapidly. Doctors not involved in the report said it presented convincing evidence. “It is clear that climate change is directly impacting our health,” said Howard Frumkin, head of the Wellcome Trust’s Our Planet, Our Health programme. “All sectors must prioritise action on climate change if we are to significantly reduce the potentially devastating impact on our planet and our health, affecting generations to come.” Prof Paul Ekins, of University College London, said the health benefits of tackling climate change had long been undervalued, with just 5% of funding for adaptation to global warming being spent on health. “These benefits are enormous, near-term and affect our health immediately,” Ekins said. “If you factor in these benefits, cutting emissions to [keep the temperature rise below] 1.5C is going to be a net benefit to humanity in monetary terms.” The Lancet report noted some promising trends, such as the phase-out of coal and the growth of electric cars. Prof Hilary Graham, of the University of York and part of the Lancet Countdown team, said linking health and climate change could help spur further action. “Health is what people feel. It makes a direct connection with their lives and the lives of people they care about like their children and grandchildren.”"
"The Trump administration published a major report on climate change the day after Thanksgiving. We will explore the key findings each day this week. Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally. US coastal communities are already bearing the brunt of rising seas and more extreme weather made worse by climate change, as was evident with the vicious 2017 hurricane season. Sea-level rise could reshape the country’s population distribution, resulting in 13.1 million people who might need to migrate by 2100 if the oceans are 6ft higher (which is actually 2ft lower than the most extreme scenario estimated). That will be expensive. Already, the federal government spent $48m to resettle a tribe in Louisiana. The US is losing more than 80,000 acres of coastal wetlands per year, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. By 2100, the US is likely to lose an additional 16% of wetlands. The wetlands are valuable ecosystems that protect humans from storms, reduce erosion from waves, enhance water quality and support fisheries and recreation. They also are sinks for the carbon dioxide from power plants, cars and industry that causes climate change. As they are degraded, they will not be able to soak up as much CO2. The National Climate Assessment raises tough questions about whether people will retreat, accommodate or protect against harsher storms and disappearing land. Helping people adapt to climate change along the coast is a difficult political proposition, as some property owners can afford to modify their homes or move while others cannot. Coastal cities – including Boston, New York, Miami, San Francisco, New Orleans and Los Angeles – are already spending to adapt to sea-level rise and more frequent flooding. But the resources they are allocating are not enough to meet future threats, the report notes."
"Americans, including Republicans, are becoming more convinced that climate change is causing extreme weather and sea-level rise, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans, 64%, now think climate change is happening, compared to 49% three years ago. And more of the general population, 78% compared to 70% three years ago, acknowledge climate change. But many people still don’t agree with the consensus science that shows humans are the dominant cause of climate change. Only 29% of people say climate change is more from human activity than natural changes in the environment or some mix of the two. Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray said he thinks climate-fueled disasters, including the wildfires in California, “have convinced folks that something is going on”. But Republicans tend to be less likely to acknowledge that humans are causing the problem. He said the conclusion for American political candidates is that “the worse the effects of climate change become the more likely people are to believe in it, which is not a very good thing if you’re trying to stop it”. The results come as Donald Trump and his key environment officials have been discounting a multi-agency report laying out the wide-scale and immediate risks climate change poses to the country. Trump said he doesn’t believe the findings and the top appointees at the environmental protection agency and interior department have questioned the assessment too, saying it focuses on the worst-case scenario. The report investigates what will happen if greenhouse gases from power plants and cars continue to rise through the century in a business-as-usual scenario, but it also warns of serious consequences even if the world manages to rein in pollution sooner. The administration has also been actively rescinding environment and climate regulations and trying to expand fossil fuel use that causes rising temperatures. Trump’s position and his efforts are not in line with public opinion, according to the poll. A large majority of Americans support action by the US government to slow climate change. The poll did not, however, ask people about their support of specific strategies that could include increased costs for consumers. "

"Anyone who has been to the islands off Scotland’s west coast will be familiar with Caledonian MacBrayne ferries. On a clear still day in summer there can be no better way (for the price of a ferry ticket) to view the beauty of the mountains and islands set against clear blue water. But winter brings a different face to the Sea of the Hebrides, which can be amongst the roughest in the world. Despite this, CalMac as the service is known, keeps going because there is no other way of supplying the islands and carrying back fish and other exports essential to the islands’ economy. These crossings are frequently not for the faint hearted, but of the 79,203 ferry crossings between January and the end of July this year fewer than 2,000 were cancelled because of the weather. The major problem for these ferries in rough seas is safe docking at the island harbours, often on exposed slipways, which is why most terminals are built in the lee of the islands, away from the full force of westerly gales. CalMac, backed by scientists , is saying cancellations are more likely in future as climate change makes winter storms increasingly violent, and more sweep in from the north-east and the south, making safe docking impossible.

"Global investors managing $32tn issued a stark warning to governments at the UN climate summit on Monday, demanding urgent cuts in carbon emissions and the phasing out of all coal burning. Without these, the world faces a financial crash several times worse than the 2008 crisis, they said. The investors include some of the world’s biggest pension funds, insurers and asset managers and marks the largest such intervention to date. They say fossil fuel subsidies must end and substantial taxes on carbon be introduced. Ministers arrive at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, on Monday for its crucial second week, when the negotiations on turning the vision of the Paris agreement into reality reach a critical point, with finance for fighting global warming a key area of dispute. “The long-term nature of the challenge has, in our view, met a zombie-like response by many,” said Chris Newton, of IFM Investors which manages $80bn and is one of the 415 groups that has signed the Global Investor Statement. “This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic.” Investment firm Schroders said there could be $23tn of global economic losses a year in the long term without rapid action. This permanent economic damage would be almost four times the scale of the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis. Standard and Poor’s rating agency also warned leaders: “Climate change has already started to alter the functioning of our world.” Thomas DiNapoli, of the $207bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, another signatory, said taking action on global warming not only avoided damage but could boost jobs and growth. “The low-carbon economy presents numerous opportunities and investors who ignore the changing world do so at their own peril.” Lord Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics said: “The low-carbon economy is the growth story of the 21st century and it is inclusive growth. Without that story, we would not have got the 2015 Paris agreement, but the story has grown stronger and stronger and is really compelling now.” The US Trump administration will hold its only event at the UN summit on Monday and is expected to promote “clean coal”. But Stern said Trump’s suggestion that action on climate change was a jobs killer was “dead wrong”. Stern said: “You don’t create jobs for the 21st century by trying to whistle up jobs from the 19th century.” A key demand of the Global Investor Statement is to phase out coal-fired power stations across the world. Peter Damgaard Jensen, the CEO of Danish pension fund PKA, said: “Investors, including PKA, are moving out of coal in their droves given its devastating effects on the climate and public health, compounded by its poor financial performance.” Dozens of nations will affirm their commitment to end their coal burning on Thursday. However, the UN summit has seen US, Chinese and Japanese financial institutions cited as leaders in providing nearly $500bn in backing for new coal plants since the Paris agreement was signed. Another investor demand on governments is to introduce “economically meaningful” taxes on carbon. Most are below $10 per tonne, but needed to rise to up to $100 in the next decade or two, the investors said. The French president Emmanuel Macron’s botched attempt to increase fuel taxes and the gilets jaunes protests that followed were a model of how not to do it, said observers in Poland. “It failed to take people along with them, accompanying the policy with social measures to allow citizens to embrace the opportunities of the transition and ride out the challenges,” said Camilla Born, of advisers E3G. The host government of the climate summit, Poland, is heavily reliant on coal and is stressing the need for a “just transition” for workers in the fossil fuel industry. The investors include some of the globe’s largest pension funds, such as Calsters and ABP, and insurers, including Aviva, AXA and Zurich. They also want an end to subsidies for coal, oil and gas, which the IMF rates at $5tn a year and which the G20 has been promising to tackle for a decade. This measure alone could cut global CO2 emissions by 10% by 2030, according a UN report released in time for the Poland summit. The investors said current national pledges to cut carbon would lead to a catastrophic 3C of global warming and that plans must be dramatically increased by 2020. For developing countries, ”finance is the critical enabler of increasing ambition,” said Niranjali Amerasinghe, of the World Resources Institute. UN climate summits are frequently dogged by disputes over the $100bn a year that rich nations have promised to poorer ones by 2020 to tackle climate change. Direct government funding and private company finance were needed, Amerasinghe said: “It is really great when private sector is out there saying we are going to invest in climate-friendly activities.”"
"The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, has met opposition party leaders as nationwide protests continue to spread across France, with students blockading about 100 schools.  After thousands of masked protesters fought running battles with police and burned cars, buildings and barricades in the most affluent areas of Paris on Saturday, the gilets jaunes – or yellow vests – citizens’ protest movement continued on Monday with peaceful anti-government demonstrations at barricades on roads and at fuel depots across France. High-school students – who have been protesting against changes to colleges and the university system – also seized on the mood of protest and stepped up their blockades. About 100 high schools were fully or partially blockaded around the country, including in the southern city of Toulouse and in Créteil in the Paris area. Seven teenagers were arrested after riot police were called to the Jean-Pierre Timbaud high school in Aubervilliers in the northern Paris suburbs where a car was overturned and bins were set alight. French authorities traditionally fear high school students joining protests because their demonstrations often spread fast. An official at the education authority in Créteil said: “Pretexts are clearly being used to commit urban violence.” An 80-year-old woman died in Marseille on Monday after she was hit by a police teargas grenade on Saturday. She was inside her apartment and had opened her windows to close her shutters when she was hit by the grenade as police confronted protesters. She died in hospital after surgery. Meanwhile, 11 fuel depots across France were shut down after being blockaded by protesters. More than 70 petrol stations had run out of fuel and restrictions were in place in Brittany on how much fuel motorists could purchase. An opinion poll for Harris Interactive taken after Saturday’s violence in Paris found 72% of French people still supported the protest movement that began last month in response to a rise in environmental taxes on fuel and has morphed into opposition to the government of the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, amid a sense that the tax system is unfair and favours the rich. The prime minister is expected to meet protesters’ representatives on Tuesday, but the grassroots movement, which emerged on social media, has no leadership nor a defined structure. One Paris representative said he had received death threats warning him not to meet the government. Jacline Mouraud, one of the protest movement’s prime instigators, said scrapping the fuel tax was a “prerequisite for any discussion” with the government. Macron’s challenge in calming the widespread anger against the government is complicated by his own desire not to yield to street protests, which repeatedly forced his predecessors into U-turns. “Thinking that, as we have always done for 30 years, that you make a little symbolic gesture and then we sweep the dust under the carpet, that doesn’t resolve the fundamental, structural problem,” the government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said, implying the government would not make major concessions. Most opposition politicians urged the government to abandon a planned tax on fuel that was to begin in January; the only exception was the Green party, which said instead that tax must be fairer. Laurent Wauquiez, the hardline leader of the rightwing Les Républicains party, said Macron should call a referendum on carbon tax “to let the people’s voice be heard”, but did not specify exactly what form a referendum would take. The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the solution for tackling the low purchasing power of struggling families lay in reducing the tax burden in France, which is among the highest in Europe. “We must speed up the reduction of taxes,” he said. “But for that we must speed up the decrease in public spending.” Saturday’s violence in Paris has alarmed the French business community, which claims it has already lost billions of euros, as representatives met the economy minister. Hotel unions said bookings were down 15%. Retailers in Paris and other cities in which there were violent protests on Saturday, such as Toulouse, said they had suffered major losses in the crucial run-up to Christmas."

"Now that Democrats have won control of the House of Representatives, the days of unchecked conservative power and liberal despair may be waning. Congressional committees vested with the authority to hold hearings, conduct investigations and serve subpoenas are likely to look into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, Donald Trump’s tax returns, the bungled hurricane response in Puerto Rico, the firing of former FBI director James Comey and resignation of attorney general Jeff Sessions, and much more. “We are coming to do something that is very important for our country: a more open Congress with accountability to the public,” California representative Nancy Pelosi, the once and probably future speaker of the House, said on Face the Nation. “We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth.” If Pelosi and House Democrats are sincere about restoring integrity to Congress, uncovering threats to democracy and seeking the truth, they should also investigate a corporation that has done long-term and probably irrevocable damage to our politics and planet: ExxonMobil. Our era is defined by interlocking crises of truth, democracy and ecology. ExxonMobil is a major actor at that intersection. Internal and external documents compiled by InsideClimate News, the Los Angeles Times and researchers at Harvard University reveal that ExxonMobil, the world’s largest fossil fuel corporation, knew as early as 1977 – and potentially as early as the 1950s – that its business activities could wreak havoc on the climate. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company outfitted the largest supertanker in its fleet with instruments to monitor the oceanic absorption of carbon dioxide and hired scientists and mathematicians to study global warming. They developed in-house climate change models and published their findings in peer-reviewed journals. In a 1978 memo, one Exxon Research manager wrote: “This may be the kind of opportunity that we are looking for to have Exxon technology, management and leadership resources put into the context of a project aimed at benefiting mankind.” But by the late 1980s, the oil giant had changed its stance. In 1988, an Exxon public affairs manager wrote that the company should “emphasize the uncertainty” of climate science. This became the “Exxon position” – and so began one of the greatest conspiracies of our time. Borrowing from big tobacco’s playbook, Exxon and other oil corporations launched public relations campaigns to sow doubt about the science behind climate change. Exxon took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, among others. One ad described climate change as “unsettled science”. Another, titled Reset the Alarm, made a claim the company knew to be false: “We still don’t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet.” ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations have spewed emissions into the atmosphere while bearing little or no cost for the damage A peer-reviewed study of the corporation’s public and private communications by Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University demonstrates that ExxonMobil actively misled the public about climate science and its implications. Exxon also hid the implications of climate science and policy from its shareholders, inflating the value of the fossil fuel assets that it would have had to abandon  to meet international climate targets. But Exxon’s deceits run even deeper. Over the years, the company channeled about $30m to researchers and activist groups promoting disinformation about global warming. Documents from the Bush administration reveal the company played a key role in dissuading the former president from signing the Kyoto protocol. In league with other fossil fuel corporations – most notably Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute – Exxon transformed the Republican party into the enemy of scientific fact.  All the while, ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel corporations have spewed emissions into the atmosphere while bearing little or no cost for the damage – and driving us headlong into a climate crisis. The latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, informed by thousands of leading studies, makes it plain: to avoid catastrophic warming of more than 1.5C (, humanity must transition from dirty to clean energy by 2030. Last month, New York state sued ExxonMobil for conducting a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” to deceive investors, analysts and insurers “concerning the company’s management of the risks posed to its business by climate change regulation”. Dozens of jurisdictions and entities across the country, including the state of Rhode Island, Boulder county in Colorado, and multiple municipalities across California have filed suits against Exxon and other oil companies. Last week, crab fishermen in California sued 30 fossil fuel corporations for damaging their fisheries.  ExxonMobil and the other fossil fuel corporations most responsible for climate change should pay their fair share to address this crisis. But if their continuing lobbying efforts are any indication, they will not. Oil and gas interests spent over $100m to stop climate action at the ballot box in the midterm elections – doling out over $41m in Colorado and $31m in Washington to defeat state-level ballot initiatives that would have restricted fracking operations to a safe distance from homes and schools and made carbon polluters pay for their waste. Recently, Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined youth climate activists in a sit-in at the Capitol Hill office of Pelosi, demanding House Democrats pursue a Green New Deal. In response, Pelosi has reaffirmed that she will revive the select committee on climate change disbanded by Republicans. For the sake of all of us, House Democrats have a duty to use the authority of that and other committees to investigate Exxon."

"The kids couldn’t believe it. The adults couldn’t believe it. Martin Place hadn’t seen anything like it for years, and Elly and her sister had never seen anything like it – ever. Elly, 14, and Aidan, 10, had come thinking the strike would be “a small thing”. Elly said she didn’t know many people from her school who were coming. She found a thousand others. On Friday, in a crowded Martin Place, the chants went up and I’ve never felt prouder. This week thousands of students in every state walked out of school to protest inaction over climate change and the sense that their future is being frittered away. They had the signs, the statistics, the anger – and the solutions too. I looked around and felt I had seen the future, clever and full of passion. I count myself as nearly of the same generation as the strikers. I’m six years out of high school, nearly graduated from university – but I’ve never seen a protest like this. I came in with cynicism. In the exact same spot, I have seen so many protests wither on the vine, outnumbered by food-court patrons. University students like to think that they are the epicentre of social change, or at least they were in the heyday of the 70s. But on Friday in Sydney all you could hear in the CBD were the school kids, and in Melbourne they stopped traffic at 1pm on a school day. Activism seems to have skipped a generation, and I couldn’t be happier. In Sydney, Jean Hinchliffe, 14, had the stage and took the roll, in a way. She asked who here was in primary school, who was in high school, who was from western Sydney, who had travelled from the bush, who wanted their politicians to do way more about climate change. The roar sent the microphones screaming into static and camera operators winced with their headphones in. Scott Morrison had told them not to gather and that only made them feel better about doing it. Finally, something the politicians couldn’t control. That was the theme of the day – the frustration of feeling powerless. “You have failed us all so terribly,” said Nosrat Fareha, 15, from Auburn Girls High school. “We deserve better. Young people can’t even vote but will have to live with the consequences of your inaction for decades.” Morrison was mentioned by every speaker and booed every time. How much he must regret that throwaway line in question time, that “kids should go to school” and be “less activist”, and the electoral harm it threatens to cause in a few more years. It was so easily turned around, and the irony obvious to all. “If Scott Morrison wants children to stop acting like a parliament, then maybe the parliament should stop acting like children,” Manjot Kaur, 17, said. It was an articulate anger, and the speakers made sure to say they had the solutions too, not just the doom and gloom. There was music and happiness. They sang Stand by Me and everyone knew the words – an old-school activist vibe to make anyone dewy-eyed. One girl said to another, “Oh I should have put you up on my shoulders for that!” and then did on the next song. “Here’s to us”, said Fareha. “The generation that can’t wait until it’s too late”. There will inevitably be blowback from the rightwing commentariat, and the politicians themselves, that these young activists have been whipped into a false frenzy. But that’s not what this was. It was a hesitant, cautious embrace of something long overdue. “When I say student, you say power!” Hinchliffe shouted. They did. And it felt like a sense of self-actualisation – hundreds looking around and thinking yes, everyone is actually, really saying it too. Maybe it’s true. The call and response came up and down Martin Place in waves, swimming long laps. They were clutching their ears it was so loud."

"Malcolm Turnbull suggested it was possible Labor’s proposal to preserve the national energy guarantee, with a 45% emissions reduction target, would not drive up prices, in an early draft of his speech to an energy conference obtained by Guardian Australia. Turnbull re-entered the energy policy fray on Tuesday at the New South Wales Smart Energy Summit with a full throated defence of his record, lauding the Snowy Hydro 2.0 expansion, and lamenting the demise of the Neg.  The former prime minister urged his Liberal colleagues to revive the Neg – abandoned as a casualty of the August leadership fight – arguing it was a “vital piece of economic policy and has strong support, none stronger I might say, than that of the current prime minister and the current treasurer”. Labor is proposing to keep the Neg with a 45% emissions reduction target. The text of the speech the former prime minister ultimately delivered on Tuesday morning, now uploaded on his website, did not address the impact of Labor’s higher target. But an earlier draft of the speech, did. “Labor has announced it will adopt the Neg but with a higher emissions target,” the early draft, seen by Guardian Australia, said. “Ours, as you know, was 26% which was only just above business as usual so it obviously had no adverse impact on prices. “There is some modelling already from Frontier Economics which suggests that Labor’s 45% target will not result in higher prices,” the early draft said. “That assertion deserves sceptical assessment, but it is also important regularly to review these models in the light of the latest technology and market information. “A great deal depends too on whether a 45% reduction means simply that emissions in 2030 – in that year – should be 45% less than in 2005. If that were the case, implying a hockey stick, the additional cost may not be as high as it would appear.” Turnbull issued the following statement to Guardian Australia about the unauthorised disclosure of his draft speech to the energy conference. “The notes were obtained by Guardian Australia without my authority. “They are incomplete draft material. The only remarks released with my authority was the speech that I gave at the conference, a transcript of which is on my website.” The Morrison government, under political pressure both on climate change and on energy policy, is attempting to portray Labor’s higher emissions reduction target as irresponsible and “economy wrecking”. The modelling referenced in the early draft of Turnbull’s speech, but deleted in the final version, found that power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios modelled by Frontier Economics – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%. That research was commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and was released in September. Turnbull did not, in his public comments on Tuesday, endorse Labor’s 45% target. He said higher emissions reduction targets needed to be guided by “engineering and economics”. When the general comments Turnbull made about reviving the Neg fuelled a Labor attack on the government’s energy policy in question time, the former prime minister took to social media to stress that he had not endorsed Labor’s 45% target. “I have not endorsed Labor’s energy policy,” the former prime minister said on Twitter. “They have adopted the Neg mechanism but have not demonstrated that their 45% emissions reduction target will not push up prices. I encouraged all parties to stick with Coalition’s Neg which retains wide community support.”"
"The UN climate change summit begins on Monday with a warning that today’s generation is the last that can prevent catastrophic global warming, as well as the first to be suffering its impacts. Almost 200 nations were set to meet in Poland for two weeks, aiming to hammer out a vital agreement to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into reality. Moves to rapidly ramp up action would be another key goal, with current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming.  The negotiations will take place against a background of ominous news: the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions were rising again, when they need to fall by half by 2030. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN. The political backdrop contains challenges as well, with climate change denial from the US president, Donald Trump, and attacks on the UN process from Brazil’s incoming Bolsonaro administration. The hosting of the summit by a coal-friendly Polish government further worries some observers. But the EU’s new intention to become climate neutral and the plummeting cost of renewable energy have been positives, while a year of extreme weather was anticipated to focus minds. “We are clearly the last generation that can change the course of climate change, but we are also the first generation with its consequences,” said Kristalina Georgieva, the CEO of the World Bank. The bank announced on Monday that its record $100bn (£78bn) of climate funding from 2021-2025 would for the first time be split equally between projects to cut emissions and those protecting people from the floods, storms and droughts that global warming is making worse. In recent years, just 5% of global funding has gone on protection, but 2018 has seen climate impacts hit hard, with heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and California and huge floods in India, Japan and east Africa. “We are already seeing the devastating impact of climate change,” Georgieva told the Guardian. “We strongly believe that action ought to go both on mitigation and on adaptation.” “Climate extremes are the new normal,” said Prof Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, in the Netherlands. “The climate debate can no longer only be about the causes – it also needs to focus on how billions of people at risk can rapidly adapt. Rich nations have promised $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and develop clean energy. Negotiators in Poland would have to bring the two blocs together with firm agreement on how the promise would be fulfilled. Gebru Jember Endalew, the chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries Group, said: “We represent almost one billion people, the people who are least responsible for climate change but among those most vulnerable to its effects. The longer poor countries have to wait [for funding], the larger the cost will become.” The negotiators in Poland must also produce a rulebook governing how action pledged under the Paris agreement was tracked and reported to ensure all nations play their part. “Fair and effective rules for accounting must be established, with special responsibilities for the big emitters such as the US and Europe but also China and India,” said Prof Johan Rockström, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “While defining a rulebook sounds boring, it is in fact essential.” The role of the Polish hosts will be crucial and the deputy energy minister Michał Kurtyka has said it would focus on using forests to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, electric vehicles and ensuring workers in fossil fuel industries were helped into new jobs. Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal and the UN summit will take place in a coal mining town, Katowice. The Polish government has also allowed two coal companies to sponsor the summit. “Having major coal companies as climate summit sponsors sends the worst possible signal at the worst possible time,” said Robert Cyglicki, Greenpeace’s director in Central and Eastern Europe. “It would be like Philip Morris sponsoring a health summit where a cigarette ban is supposed to be agreed. We will know this was a successful summit if coal companies regret sponsoring it.” Many nations remain firmly committed to climate action, particularly France and China. But the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned last week that the rise of populism was undermining the political will of some countries to work with others. “We have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections,” he said. “This has led in my opinion to a lack of political will.” “Every day, we witness the effects of the changing climate on poor and vulnerable people around the world,” said Adriana Opromolla, at NGO Caritas Internationalis. “Transformation is possible, but political will is needed to make it happen.”"

"Emmanuel Macron’s defeat by the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement over a proposed eco-tax rise is likely to come as a painful lesson for environmental policymakers at this week’s UN climate talks in Katowice. After the most violent protests in Paris for half a century, the French president has been forced to postpone a planned eco-tax rise on fuel, showing how ecological measures can have explosive consequences if there is any suggestion they are being used to “greenwash” austerity.  Other leaders will need better timing and a far defter political touch before they introduce similar measures to reduce carbon emissions. Dozens of countries and cities have introduced or drawn up plans for carbon taxes to speed the transition from fossil fuels that are warming the planet to increasingly dangerous levels. They are rarely easy to implement. There have also been protests and political backwards steps in Belgium, Tunisia, Algeria and Canada. Macron has positioned himself as one of the pioneers. He has championed the Paris climate agreement and promised to make France an example of how economies can grow as they cut carbon emissions. In contrast to the me-first-ism of Donald Trump, the French leader’s slogan has been “Make our planet great again”. According to government officials, this goal was behind the plan to increase petrol prices by four euro cents a litre from January. This, they said, was one of several steps towards France’s commitment to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 and to ban sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. The economic and environmental logic is sound. Raising the price of carbon is an essential tool if global warming is to be kept below the dangerous level of 1.5C, according to the recent report by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. This year’s Nobel laureate for economics, William Nordhaus, was one of the first advocates of a global carbon tax as the best way to put a true cost on the use of coal, oil and gas.  It is a matter of justice. Without a carbon tax, the health and pollution costs of cars and trucks are unfairly passed on to society in the form of respiratory problems, congested, dirty streets and an increasingly unstable climate. Fuel taxes are also an incentive for change. As the former Nasa scientist James Hansen has noted: “As long as fossil fuels seem the cheapest energy to the public, they’ll keep using them.” But while policy wonks across the world agree on the principle of “polluter pays”, Macron has clearly found it hard to convince the French public on two key questions: what they are supposed to be paying for and whether the burden is being fairly shared. The majority of the hundreds of thousands of gilets jaunes protesters are from low- or middle-income families who are hardest hit by the fuel price rises because they spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on fuel and transport. They may have found the eco-tax rise easier to stomach if the revenues were then redistributed among the public, a model already used in British Colombia that Justin Trudeau plans to expand throughout Canada. There would also be less hostility if the revenues were ringfenced for renewable energy, environmental homes or a better healthcare system to deal with the costs of air pollution and rising temperatures. Instead, protesters have been able to argue the tax will be used mainly to cut France’s budget deficit by paying off wealthy creditors, in effect worsening inequality. Macron has also demonstrated poor timing by announcing a rise in diesel and petrol taxes after a year in which oil prices rose by 23% largely because of Opec limits on production. “Maybe he should have taken that into account and waited until the price goes down. Or perhaps he should have returned some revenue,” said Bob Ward of the Grantham Institute. Instead of a tax, he said governments could also consider alternatives such as raising standards on vehicles, which has been the approach taken by California. “You have to find the right mechanism.” It also helps to secure public approval. The city of Boulder in Colorado introduced a carbon tax after a majority of voters cast ballots in favour of the move. Seven US states are also considering similar steps following midterm elections in which many Democrats campaigned on promises of climate action. In the UK, a carbon tax in the power sector has helped to phase out coal, but the prime minister, Theresa May, appears too politically weak to consider action on fuel. In the most recent budget, the chancellor once again left fuel taxes unchanged, where they have remained since 1999. Earlier governments promised “an escalator” of steadily rising duties to tackle environmental concerns about road traffic. But this commitment has not been met since massive fuel protests in 2000."
"Just a couple of months shy of 50 years ago, along with other students, I produced an anti-Vietnam war poster that urged high-school students to join the Student Underground Movement. As my first piece of street art it was hardly earth-shattering but was a tiny part of something that contributed, by May 1970, to a major student strike in which thousands of high-school students in Sydney and Melbourne took to the streets to protest the war in the lead-up to the moratoriums of that year.  It was a distant war insofar as it was in an obscure part of south-east Asia, but one with immediate consequences for those high-school students. If nothing else, some students — or their brothers — faced conscription and potential death on the Mekong Delta or the jungles of Nui Dat; let alone complicity in a colonial war that was leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. A response of Liberal-Country party governments at the time was to suspend students who participated in anti-Vietnam war activities. Indeed, the then Victorian premier, Henry Bolte, threatened to expel students and prevent them from completing their high-school certificates. I was lucky in New South Wales, only being suspended for two days for daring to display a Vietnam moratorium sticker on my school bag — others were suspended for longer or indeed expelled. And so the response to recent high-school activism over climate change by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has an uncanny echo five decades on. There’s a different set of initials now: LNP. But the message is the same. High-school students should shut up, knuckle down, and stay away from the real world of political discussion – in this case the issue of climate change and campaigns to shift government action/inaction on the issue. We shouldn’t be listening to young people who nevertheless will have to bear the consequences of climate change – that “listening” is bitterly opposed by our prime minister. He told parliament they should stay in the classroom rather than thinking about things that “can be dealt with outside of school”. Really? “Each day I send my kids to school and I know other members’ kids should also go to school but we do not support our schools being turned into parliaments,” Morrison said in parliament. “What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools. “We are committed to all of these things [climate change action] but I will tell you what we are also committed to — kids should go to school.” Learning? Activism? Going to school? You don’t get it, prime minister. Your government urges young people to take up Stem subjects — yet rejects them out of hand when they take those learnings into life in confronting climate change. Perhaps it is the politicians that should go back to school and do a bit of learning. And all power to those high-school students who will be putting their hands up on climate change. History is on your side. Chips Mackinolty is an Alice Springs-based artist and writer"

"More than a dozen of Australia’s largest mining and infrastructure companies may be in breach of their legal duties by refusing to consider the financial risks posed by climate change, an investor action group says. In September, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission published a report that said “the law requires” relevant companies to “include a discussion of climate risk” in their annual report. Market Forces, a group that advocates for environmentally sustainable investment, assisted shareholders at company annual general meetings. Almost all of those companies ignored or dismissed climate change as a financial risk to their business. “Directors are legally required to consider climate risk. Failure to do so may constitute a breach of their legal duties,” Market Forces campaigner Rachel Deans said. “It appears directors are openly admitting to breaking the law at their shareholder meetings and Asic seems to be well aware of it.”At the Prairie Mining AGM, chairman Ian Middlemas was asked whether the board supported the Paris agreement targets. “It’s not on our radar,” he said. “I think they are the sort of questions that are for people that are producing product and have got an actual operation. We’re just simply exploring.“So I’m not sure ... just trying to think of what’s a good example … it’s like if you have a toddler at home and someone asks which university will he go to, well the answer is ‘we will work it out when he is 18’.“I’d love us to be in a position where we have to have an idea about climate change, and an idea about Paris you know … what you just raised. But it’s sort of like having an idea of what happens in Sydney when you live in Perth.” When asked whether Senex Energy followed a 2C or 3C climate increase target, the company’s chairman Trevor Bourne said: “We don’t operate our company on either.“Whether it is two or three [degrees] that is a bigger issue for the government to address. If they get off their backside and do something about it, it would make our investment decisions much clearer.” In September Asic audited 60 companies and found only 10 identified climate as a material risk. Among the findings of that report was that companies were legally bound to “include a discussion of climate risk when it could affect the entity’s achievement of its financial performance or disclosed outcomes”. “Directors should also consider the requirement to include any relevant analytical comments and specify how risk factors that are within the control of management will be managed.”A legal opinion, written for the Centre for Policy Development, warned of potential consequences for a lack of disclosure. “It is likely only a matter of time before we see litigation against a director who has failed to perceive, disclose or take steps in relation to a foreseeable climate-related risk that can be demonstrated to have caused harm to a company,” the opinion said. Deans said it was not just a legal requirement, but also a responsible business practice. “Shareholders are frustrated that companies are not looking at the financial risks climate change poses to their business,” she said. “It is likely we will see more cases of directors being sued if they don’t start taking climate risk seriously.”"
"China must play a leading role if the world is to draw up a new and more effective strategy to halt the collapse of life on Earth, according to senior delegates at the close of this week’s UN biodiversity conference. With the US absent, Europe distracted and Brazil tilting away from global cooperation, the onus has shifted towards Beijing, the diplomats said after two weeks of slow-moving talks on how to maintain the natural infrastructure on which humanity depends.  China will host the next high-level negotiations, in 2020, which will be the most important in more than 10 years. This is the deadline for nations to agree on fresh global targets for the protection and management of forests, rivers, oceans, pollinators and other wildlife. Conservationists hope this “new deal for nature and people” becomes as much of a priority as the Paris climate accord and helps to reverse the current wave of extinction, which is at the highest rate the world has seen since the age of the dinosaurs. Over the coming two years, China should champion the cause of nature as France championed the cause of climate in the run-up to the Paris deal in 2016, urged the diplomats. “China is very important. It can be a great leader,” said Hesiquio Benítez Díaz, Mexico’s director general of international cooperation, who helped organise the previous global biodiversity conference. “We’re reaching the point of no return for many species. It’s really bad, but people don’t see this issue.” Rather than leaving biodiversity on the fringes, where it has until now been dealt with mostly by politically weak environment ministers and NGOs, he hoped Beijing would use its clout to ensure the subject was high on the agenda of G8 and G20 summits and to press for participation by heads of state in 2020. They also want the issue to be taken up by communities, companies and individuals. This message was echoed by the executive secretary of the biodiversity convention. “We tell China that the biodiversity agenda needs a lot of championing,” said Cristiana Paşca Palmer. “They were instrumental in the success of Paris and they can play a very important role.” Until recently, China’s dire pollution problems and woeful record on wildlife conservation meant it would have been an unlikely champion of nature. However, under President Xi Jinping perceptions have started to shift. The government has promoted the concept of “ecological civilisation”, established hundreds of environmental courts and played a positive role in global climate talks. At the conference, Beijing sent mixed messages. It initially ignored a proposal to get involved in preparations with Mexico (the previous host) and Egypt (the host this year), and it remained low-key in Sharm el-Sheikh over the past two weeks of talks. “We were very nervous about their silence,” confided one foreign diplomat. But those familiar with the Chinese delegation said this reflected a difference of approach. Rather than set ambitious public goals, they said the country preferred to set expectations low and work at a higher level behind the scenes. “They are really determined to succeed, but they don’t know how to do it,” said another source. A shift in pace and priorities is essential. Delegate after delegate in Sharm el-Sheikh warned of risks to food production and human wellbeing from the loss of corals, forests and the 60% loss of biodiversity since 1972. There was recognition that the current global management plan has been a failure: among the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets, only one – on the creation of protected areas – is measurably close to being met. Highlighting the low priority that even the host government put on nature, a shop near the conference centre was openly selling an illegal lion hide for $1,500 (£1,170). This convention established a process to draw-up a “Post 2020 Road Map” with more forceful and effective goals. But the political winds are even less favourable than in 2010. Brazil, which played an important role eight years ago, will soon have a far-right government and its diplomats spent much of the time on niggling issues that could have an impact on exploitation of its world-leading biodiversity. At one point the conference spent 35 minutes debating whether to be “concerned” or “deeply concerned” about the impact of climate change. A row broke out between developing and developed nations over how to share the economic benefits from genetic sequencing information. Tense negotiations were also needed to set new guidelines for gene drive technology, which can be used to eradicate entire species. Governments stopped short of imposing a moratorium, but built in strong precautions by insisting that no research be allowed without risk assessment , risk management and the consent of any communities who might be affected by the release of modified organisms. Crucially, the delegates struggled to identify what kind of target should be set. There was widespread agreement that biodiversity needed a single measurable headline goal – equivalent to the 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) in climate negotiations. But there is, as yet, no single metric that can cover the complex interaction of life on Earth. Instead, discussions centred on setting either zero net loss of natural habitat or a broad goal to “bend the curve”, which means reverse biodiversity loss worldwide through a series of bottom-up national commitments and wider demarcations of nature reserves, protected areas and traditional or indigenous community land. Pooven Moodley, the executive director of the NGO Natural Justice, said the conference had seen progress in terms of greater recognition of the need for improved environmental rights and more land tenure for indigenous groups. But he said overall the negotiations had failed to take into account the urgency of the crisis. “It does feel like rearranging the deckchairs as the Titanic sinks,” he said. Frustrations were also expressed by Ruth Davis, the deputy director of global programmes at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “I am used to the UN – its ups and downs – but it’s still disorienting listening to hours of wrangling over single words in obscure documents in empty rooms when this is supposed – quite literally – to be about a plan to save life on Earth,” she tweeted. Despite occasional grumbles, delegates said the situation would be worse without the convention, which at least obliges governments to assess biodiversity and report every four years (with the exception of the US, which is the only nation that does not take part). Protected areas – the one concrete target from 2010 – have expanded substantially in the past eight years. Conservation efforts have also helped to pull a few species including whales and mountain gorillas back from the brink of extinction. Pasça Palmer, the UN head of biodiversity, said she too wanted more urgency, but she remained optimistic that a deal could be done in 2020. “The best possible outcome would be to have a clear recognition that biodiversity is infrastructure affecting life and development. We have to govern in a holistic way, not just one species. And we need to make it clear in people’s minds that without it, we won’t have a healthy planet.” China will have its work cut out. • This article was amended on 3 December 2018 because an earlier version converted absolute temperatures, rather than temperature increases.

"The American lobster is a symbol of Maine, central to the state’s ethos and economy. Its image appears on license plates, restaurant signs and clothing. It is sold alive, with its claws banded shut, on docks, at highway rest stops and supermarkets. Cooked, it is served everywhere from seaside shacks to the finest restaurants.  Lobster attracts tourists, feeds locals and is a lifeblood for coastal towns. Its importance has even swelled in recent years as lobsters have been caught in record numbers. Lobster landings – or the amount of lobster caught – have risen fivefold in the past three decades. Lobster has become a half-billion-dollar industry in Maine. And the reason for the boom, according to scientists, is climate change. The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99% of the world’s waters, rising at three times the global average. That warming has created optimal conditions for lobsters to reproduce and survive into adulthood. “It’s actually been really positive for us. We’ve seen probably the most favourable environmental conditions for lobsters ever,” said Patrice McCarron, the executive director of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, which represents more than 1,000 members of the state’s lobster industry.  But while the warming waters have resulted in a lobster bonanza, scientists say climate change will ultimately bring a bust to the boom: As the Gulf of Maine continues to warm, that temperature sweet spot for lobsters will continue to move north. That could result in a similar spike in lobsters in Canada, but leave Maine’s industry broken. According to a report released earlier this year from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) in Portland, while the lobster population has risen over 500% along Maine’s coast over the past 30 years, the population is expected to drop by between 40% and 62% by 2050. Climate change has already hit lobster populations in states south of Maine, seeing once-robust lobster fisheries in Massachusetts, Rhode Island – and even Connecticut, New Jersey and New York – decline. Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at GMRI, says it is tempting to think that lobster populations are migrating with temperature, but that is not the case. “It’s more that the populations that are here can become more or less productive. So lobsters in southern New England, they just can’t produce baby lobsters at the same rate our lobsters can and they have higher mortality, so fewer of them survive to reproduce,” he said.  While a drop of 40% to 62% would return Maine to levels of lobster landings it saw before the boom, the decades after 2050 could spell disaster. “If we don’t get carbon under control and we’re looking at three degrees [celsius] of warming by the end of the century, Maine starts to feel like best case Rhode Island and worst case New Jersey,” said Pershing. “And nobody is putting lobsters on license plates in New Jersey.” Climate change is politically divisive in America, where the president has called it a hoax and said he did not believe his own government’s national climate assessment, which found that climate change could greatly damage the US economy. But in places like Stonington, a tiny lobster town in southern Maine on remote, wind-lashed Deer Isle, climate change is something one can see and feel. “We can see the effects. We can see different species coming up in the traps,” said Genevieve McDonald, a Stonington lobsterman. “Climate change is real. If you work on the water you can see it. Data is real, science is real, temperature is real.” McDonald was early in her lobstering career when the number of lobsters soared in the waters off Stonington. “All of the sudden we had lobsters everywhere, places there were never lobsters before,” she said. “In every nook and cranny and crevice and type of bottom there were lobsters. It was awesome.” It isn’t just the lobsters and the foreign species showing up off Stonington’s shores that make residents think of climate change. On Tuesday, storm surge saw cars and trucks navigating through seaweed and sea water on the narrow, low-lying causeway, the only road leading off Deer Isle. In Stonington, lobsters are life. The town has pulled more lobster from the frigid waters than any other Maine port in recent years. Nearly everybody seems to work in the lobster industry or have a role supporting the fishermen.  “We live in a lobstocracy,” says Carla Guenther, chief scientist at the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries in Stonington. “It’s central to our politics, our social structure, everything.” Losing the industry would be devastating. Previously, Stonington had other fisheries – such as for groundfish like cod, haddock and flounder. Ted Ames, a retired Stonington fisherman, saw all of those fisheries collapse over the decades, but when they did, fishermen always turned to something else to make a living. Today, lobsters are everything. “If you’re stuck with one fishery, you’re good until it hiccups and then you’re out of business. This time around there isn’t any other option,” he said.  Maine and its lobstermen have worked hard to conserve the lobster population and take pride in their efforts. The number of lobstering licenses is capped and the number of traps is restricted. Lobster licenses are only issued to owner-operators, meaning that there is no industrial lobstering. Small lobsters, big lobsters and egg-bearing females are all tossed back. Traps are equipped with a biodegradable ring that eventually disintegrates, allowing lobsters to escape and survive in case a trap is lost on the ocean’s floor. But despite their conservation efforts, the fate of the fishery is probably out of the hands of lobstermen. “There’s only so much our lobstermen can do,” said GMRIs Pershing. “If the rest of the world doesn’t get a handle on carbon, the coast of Maine is going to look really different in 2080.”"
"Australia’s carbon emissions have again continued to increase, according to official government figures released on Friday. The results show emissions are rising much faster than in recent years – the quarterly growth trend is the highest it has been since 2004. Australia’s emissions, seasonally adjusted, increased 1.3% over the past quarter. Excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (for which the calculations are controversial), they are at a record high. But per capita emissions have continued to decline, and are now at their lowest level in 28 years. The report puts the absolute increase down to a rise in fugitive emissions because of increased LNG production, as well as higher emissions from transport and other sectors. The new figures add evidence to claims by the United Nations, climate and energy analysts, and the opposition that Australia will fail to meet its Paris targets. On Wednesday, the UN released its annual emissions gap report, which looks at the gap between carbon reduction policies in each country and what is required to keep global warming well below 2C. The report found that Australia would fall short of meeting its nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris agreement, saying: “There has been no improvement in Australia’s climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the NDC target. “The latest projection published by the government shows that emissions would remain at high levels rather than reducing in line with the 2030 target.” Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Wednesday the government had “the right mix of scalable policies to meet our 2030 targets”. “Policies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation have led to emissions reductions in the electricity sector, for instance,” she said. “And they continue to deliver results. Wind and solar generation in the national electricity market is projected to increase by 250% over the next three years.” "
"The US and Russia have thrown climate talks into disarray by allying with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to water down approval of a landmark report on the need to keep global warming below 1.5C. After a heated two-and-a-half-hour debate on Saturday night, the backwards step by the four major oil producers shocked delegates at the UN climate conference in Katowice as ministers flew in for the final week of high-level discussions.  It has also raised fears among scientists that the US president, Donald Trump, is going from passively withdrawing from climate talks to actively undermining them alongside a coalition of climate deniers. Two months ago, representatives from the world’s governments hugged after agreeing on the 1.5C report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), commissioned to spell out the dire consequences should that level of warming be exceeded and how it can be avoided. Reaching a global consensus was a painstaking process involving thousands of scientists sifting through years of research and diplomats working through the night to ensure the wording was acceptable to all nations. But when it was submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on Saturday, the four oil allies – with Saudi Arabia as the most obdurate – rejected a motion to “welcome” the study. Instead, they said it should merely be “noted”, which would make it much easier for governments to ignore. The motion has not yet been able to pass as a result of the lack of consensus. It opened up a rift at the talks that will be hard to close in the coming five days. During the plenary, the EU, a bloc of the 47 least developed countries, as well as African and Latin and South American nations, all spoke in favour of the report. Several denounced the four countries trying to dilute its importance. Rueanna Haynes, a delegate for St Kitts and Nevis, told the plenary it was “ludicrous” not to welcome a report that UN member nations had commissioned two years earlier and to hold up crucial talks over two words. “It’s very frustrating that we are not able to take into account the report’s findings: we are talking about the future of the world – it sounds like hyperbole when I say it, but that’s how serious it is,” she told the Guardian. “I would say that this issue has to be resolved. This is going to drag out and the success of the COP is going to hang on this as well as other issues.” Scientists were also outraged. “It is troubling. Saudi Arabia has always had bad behaviour in climate talks, but it could be overruled when it was alone or just with Kuwait. That it has now been joined by the US and Russia is much more dangerous,” said Alden Meyer, the director of strategy and policy in the Union of Concerned Scientists. He said the shift in the US position would be embarrassing for the country if it persisted. “Donald Trump is the denier-in-chief. He takes a personal interest in dissing scientists,” said Meyer. “But the science won’t go away. The law of thermodynamics can’t be ignored.” Climate campaigners said the four blocking governments had been overrun by fossil-fuel interests and were trying to sideline the study. May Boeve, the executive director of the activist group 350.org, said: “Deliberately ignoring the IPCC report would be wholly irresponsible and 350.org stands with the rest of world in condemning these climate deniers … and the vested fossil fuel interests behind them.”  Ministers have only five days to establish a rulebook for the Paris agreement. A wild card is the role of the host nation, Poland – the most coal-dependant nation in Europe – which will chair the final week of the meeting. “The big challenge now is for the Polish presidency to set aside its obsession with coal, get out of the way and allow full acknowledgement of the IPCC 1.5C report, and its implications for increasing the ambition of all countries, in the conclusion of COP24 later this week,” said Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics.  As well as acceptance of the report, there are several other potential fights brewing regarding transparency rules for reporting emissions and proposals for wealthy high emitters to provide financial support to poorer nations struggling to adapt."
"The Extinction Rebellion climate protest group has expanded to 35 countries and is building towards a week of international civil disobedience in April, according to organisers, who are using UN climate talks in Poland this week to widen its network. The rapid spread of the movement, which consisted of 10 people in the UK six months ago, comes amid rising frustration with policymakers who are failing to slow perilous levels of global warming and biodiversity loss. The distinctive banner of the group was evident at a rally on Saturday attended by several thousand climate campaigners in Katowice, the city hosting the conference. Campaigners also held Skype workshops for activists in Berlin, after training sessions in the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Ghana and Poland. “In the two months since our first action, we have expanded more than we imagined,” Liam Geary Baulch, an environmental activist, said. “We are now planning to change our structure so it can accommodate up to 2 million people.” Extinction Rebellion rose to prominence last month when thousands of activists blocked five London bridges, glued themselves to public buildings and disrupted traffic with “swarming” protests that led to dozens of arrests. This form of direct action has struck a chord in other countries. The Dutch activist Sjoerd de Koning said he would be among 60 people starting a chapter of the movement in The Hague next week. “We saw what was going on in London and thought this is what we have been looking for for a long time – peaceful civil disobedience targeted at politicians,” he said. “There is a lot of energy in this movement and it’s global.” In Poland, most environmental campaigns until now have been locally focused on issues such as smog in Silesia, deforestation in Białowieża and wetland destruction in Rospuda, but activists are starting to sign up to Extinction Rebellion, which some see as a potential umbrella organisation. “We can all unite under this and make our voice heard,” said Izabella Mier, a member of a food sovereignty group. “It’s incredibly inspiring to bring different organisations together for a common goal. We’re looking for a way not just to be worried about climate change but to do something.” The Warsaw chapter held its first meeting two weeks ago, when about 50 people watched a video about the bridge blocking actions. Wiktor Kotowski, a wetland scientist at the University of Warsaw, signed up online and then printed his own Extinction Rebellion T-shirt, which he wore while speaking at a side event during the climate talks. “After I heard the Polish president open the conference with a bullshit claim that we can protect the climate by burning coal, I thought I had to do something,” he said. “This is a moment when scientists should get more active in society. I’ve been thinking this for a couple of years.” The movement has received mixed levels of support from other international climate campaign groups. The US-based 350.org – which has organised direct action protests against gas and oil pipelines – has been an enthusiastic backer, while Greenpeace has so far offered help only behind the scenes. Extinction Rebellion organisers say it will be necessary for chapters in each country to adapt tactics according to the local political situations. The challenge was highlighted in Poland by the government’s initial refusal to allow entry into the country by 350.org campaigners, reportedly on the grounds that they were a “threat to national security”.  Unlike anti-World Trade Organization protesters, black-bloc anarchist groups or gilets jaunes demonstrations against austerity and fuel-tax rises in France, environmental campaigners say their actions have focused on non-violent civil disobedience. On Sunday, 100 academics and other prominent backers of Extinction Rebellion called for people around the world to rise up and organise against the “paralysis” of political leaders. “We must collectively do whatever’s necessary non-violently, to persuade politicians and business leaders to relinquish their complacency and denial,” the open letter stated, which was signed by Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben, and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, among others."
"Airlines are failing to take up the most efficient planes in sufficient numbers to make a significant dent in their carbon dioxide emissions, a new study has found. The most efficient new aircraft models, such as the Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 and A320neo, can achieve substantial carbon savings over older models, but no airlines have invested sufficiently in the new types to reach the top levels of energy efficiency, according to a ranking by Atmosfair, a German NGO. In the annual Atmosfair Airline Index for 2018, published on Saturday, no airlines received an A for efficiency, and only two airlines were ranked in efficiency class B. TUI Airways, the British holiday airline, came top of the rankings for the second year running, reaching just under 80% of the possible optimum level of carbon emissions. TUI Fly, the company’s German counterpart, came in fourth. Atmosfair also found that only one in 10 airlines worldwide were succeeding in keeping their greenhouse gas emissions constant while achieving economic growth. Among these were Thai Airways, Finnair, American Airlines and All Nippon Airlines. Dietrich Brockhagen, executive director of Atmosfair, said: “Our results show that the efficiency improvements of the vast majority of airlines worldwide is not sufficient [to keep within the] 2C or 1.5C target [of the Paris agreement]. We need new, synthetic and CO2-neutral fuels and other more radical measures to curb CO2 emissions in the sector.” British Airways was placed at 74th, with an efficiency rating of D, behind companies such as Aeroflot and Aeromexico. It fell behind many of Europe’s other flag carriers, including Alitalia, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and Iberia. British Airways said: “We are committed to reducing our carbon emissions and have improved efficiency by more than 10% since 2008. We are well on course to deliver a 25% improvement in carbon emissions reduction by 2025. British Airways is the first airline in Europe to invest in building a plant to generate renewable jet fuel from household waste, and last week we kicked off a research project with some of the UK’s leading universities to find a way to power a long-haul aircraft with 300 customers on board with zero emissions.” The company also pointed to a commitment by its parent group IAG to invest $400m (£313.6m) on alternative sustainable fuel development over the next 20 years. Virgin Atlantic Airways ranks 83rd in the world, behind many airlines from developing countries such as Indonesia’s Garuda, Royal Air Maroc, Air India, and Taiwan’s Eva Air. This showing comes despite the much-publicised activities of Sir Richard Branson, Virgin’s chairman, in highlighting the risks of climate change. Branson co-founded the Carbon War Room, which since 2009 has operated as a non-profit organisation aimed at speeding up the adoption of cleaner, low-emissions technology by businesses. Virgin took issue with the report methodology, saying it misrepresented the airline. A spokeswoman added: “We have undertaken a massive renewal programme to replace our entire fleet over a 10 year period, switching from four-engine aircraft to much more efficient two-engine aircraft. As a result we have reduced our aircraft carbon emissions by 23.7% since 2007. Our carbon emissions will continue to reduce as we take delivery of more new aircraft over the next three years.” Carbon emissions from airlines grew by about 5% last year, while the number of kilometres flown increased by 6%, according to Atmosfair, showing that much more needs to be done to ensure aviation does not take up an unsustainable amount of the world’s remaining “carbon budget”. Biofuels are being given trials as an alternative to fossil fuels for aviation, but these carry their own difficulties, not least the threat of deforestation. Virgin recently used recycled waste to fuel a flight, a potentially more environmentally sound alternative. “You cannot beat physics, therefore long-haul flights will not be feasible with heavy batteries and electric engines,” said Brockhagen. “But you can produce carbon neutral kerosene synthetically, using carbon extracted from the air, water and green electricity. This is ready technologically, but 10 times more expensive per gallon than fossil kerosene. Who will invest the billions to scale this technology up? If airlines grouped together they could do it, but this would require an international spirit of cooperation over competition, so far rarely seen in the industry.” There are also ways for airlines to reduce their emissions without resorting to new fuels and planes, through adjusting their pilots’ flying practices and small tweaks to planes. Some airlines look to offset their emissions through carbon reductions elsewhere. A spokesman for Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said: “UK airlines are making enormous efforts to reduce their carbon emissions, and are committed to a global target to cut CO2 emissions from all flights by 50% of their 2005 levels by 2050, through technology, operational efficiency improvements and the use of sustainable biofuels. On top of this, in 2016 the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation to address CO2 emissions from international aviation – a global first for any sector.”"
"The largest ever group of institutional investors has called on governments around the world to urgently increase their efforts to meet the Paris climate change agreement goals. The 414 global investors - which represent US$31 trillion of assets-under-management - say they are deeply concerned about the “ambition gap” that exists between governments’ commitments and what is needed to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. They say that gap is increasing the physical risks from climate change and hampering investors’ ability to properly allocate trillions of dollars needed to support the much-needed transition to a low carbon economy. They have signed a “Global Investor Statement” to be handed to world leaders this week at the COP24 - the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Poland. The signatories include some of the world’s largest pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies, including Australian investors BT Financial Group, Australian Super, Cbus, HESTA, IFM Investors, Local Government Super, and VicSuper. It is the single largest intervention from investors on climate change, surpassing even the one issued in Paris. The investor statement includes recommendations for governments on the specific steps the investors believe are needed to support a low carbon transition. Among specific policies, they request governments “phase out thermal coal power”, “put a meaningful price on carbon” and “phase out fossil fuel subsidies.” The three major areas for government action are: Achieve the Paris Agreement’s goals – update nationally-determined contributions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, to complete the process no later than 2020 Accelerate private sector investment into the low carbon transition – put a meaningful price on carbon, phase out fossil fuel subsidies by set deadlines, and phase out thermal coal power worldwide by set deadline. Commit to improve climate-related financial reporting The intervention comes as findings of a recent UN report show that nations must triple their efforts to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Chris Newton, the executive director of responsible investment, IFM Investors, which has $81bn in assets under management, says the long-term nature of the problem of climate change has met with a “zombie-like response” from policymakers. “This is a recipe for disaster as the impacts of climate change can be sudden, severe and catastrophic,” he said. “We need our infrastructure assets to continue to provide essential services to communities and economies around the world. We have a duty to our investors to act for the long term when others are clearly sidestepping the challenge”. The global investment manager Schroders, a signatory to the statement, warned recently that current global policies implied long-run temperature rises of around 4°C, with $23 trillion of associated global economic losses over the next 80 years – representing permanent economic damage three or four times the scale of the impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis. The investors are also calling for the phase out of coal power worldwide. They have welcomed growing support for the global “Powering Past Coal Alliance,” which was launched by the UK and Canada, and which now has 28 national government signatories, alongside other sub-national and corporate supporters. Australia is not a signatory to the alliance, but the Australian Capital Territory government is."

"Almost two decades ago a new fresh-faced leader of the centre-left emerged in Europe and appeared, having won a historic election, on the cusp of changing politics in his country. But as he flew higher, he lost a sense of the public mood and failed to face up early on to a crisis which brought his modern industrial society to a halt. In doing so he revealed an inability to control events or win around public opinion. Then the country was Britain and the young prime minister Tony Blair. Today the nation is France; and the leader is Emmanuel Macron. Then, as now, a series of seemingly leaderless protests saw aggrieved social constituents latch on to a narrowly framed but popular economic grievance: the rising cost of fuel due to green taxes. Mr Blair considered bringing in the army. Mr Macron weighs up whether a state of emergency will restore order. It is tempting think plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose – but that would ignore the broader picture. President Macron faces a threat far more existential than Mr Blair did. Liberal democracies are being destabilised by the ability of groups to organise and criticise on social media with arguments that previously would have taken longer to enter the political bloodstream. The gilets jaunes (yellow vest) unrest saw 170,000 take to the nation’s streets at the weekend. Rioters torched cars and buildings. Scribbled on the Arc de Triomphe was “Macron resignation”. Mr Macron’s pro-business rhetoric and tin ear for the street have seen him cast as the embodiment of the nation’s elite, disconnected from the country, and willing to favour the rich.  Mr Macron was right to suggest that higher fuel taxes are needed to fight climate change. Promoting green policies is crucial in the week that climate talks begin in Poland. We have just a dozen years to reduce emissions and cap global warming at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Mr Blair ended above-inflation increases of fuel prices. This was a mistake: the long-term survival of this planet rests on politicians making the right call. But while higher taxes can be useful to change people’s behaviours, they are not sufficient when so many people feel they are an extra burden in precarious times. Mr Macron ought to recall the words of Louis XIV’s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who remarked wisely that “the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”. The sound of gilets jaunes hissing is now ringing in the French president’s ears. Seen as aloof and well-off, Mr Macron needs to regain his popular touch. His party, La République En Marche, will square off against the far-right Rassemblement National (the re-branded National Front) in the European parliament elections next May. Mr Macron staked his future on winning over Germany by delivering pro-market structural reforms in France, which would put an end to EU reprimands over Paris’s budget plans. His bet that tax cuts would be more popular than more spending has not paid off. Whatever their benefits, the only tax cut people remember is the one for the rich. Mr Macron’s big ideas have also been relegated by Berlin in favour of smaller measures. It would be smarter now to steer Europe away from market-heavy policies and put a greater emphasis on growth in France’s stuttering economy. The unemployment rate is still stubbornly close to 10%. Mr Macron is right that the eurozone would operate better with a federal fiscal capacity and a full banking union. But he can only make those arguments by being canny enough to win over voters at home.  • This article was amended on 4 December 2018 because an earlier version said 170,000 took to the streets of Paris at the weekend. That is the estimated figure for the country, not just the city. This has been corrected."

"The global food system is broken, leaving billions of people either underfed or overweight and driving the planet towards climate catastrophe, according to 130 national academies of science and medicine across the world. Providing a healthy, affordable, and environmentally friendly diet for all people will require a radical transformation of the system, says the report by the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP). This will depend on better farming methods, wealthy nations consuming less meat and countries valuing food which is nutritious rather than cheap.  The report, which was peer reviewed and took three years to compile, sets out the scale of the problems as well as evidence-driven solutions.  The global food system is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all emissions from transport, heating, lighting and air conditioning combined. The global warming this is causing is now damaging food production through extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. The food system also fails to properly nourish billions of people. More than 820 million people went hungry last year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, while a third of all people did not get enough vitamins. At the same time, 600 million people were classed as obese and 2 billion overweight, with serious consequences for their health. On top of this, more than 1bn tonnes of food is wasted every year, a third of the total produced. “The global food system is broken,” said Tim Benton, professor of population ecology, at the University of Leeds, who is a member of one of the expert editorial groups which produced the report. He said the cost of the damage to human health and the environment was much greater than the profits made by the farming industry. “Whether you look at it from a human health, environmental or climate perspective, our food system is currently unsustainable and given the challenges that will come from a rising global population that is a really [serious] thing to say,” Benton said. Reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way individuals can lessen their impact on the planet, according to recent research. And tackling dangerous global warming is considered impossible without massive reductions in meat consumption.  Research published in the journal Climate Policy shows that at the present rate, cattle and other livestock will be responsible for half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and that to prevent this will require “substantial reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors”. “It is vital [for a liveable planet] that we change our relationship with meat, especially with red meat. But no expert in this area is saying the world should be vegan or even vegetarian,” said Benton. Rearing cattle and other livestock causes the same carbon emissions as all the world’s vehicles, trains, ships and planes combined. “We have spent 30 to 40 years investing quite heavily on fuel efficiency in the transport sector,” said Benton. “We need do something similarly radical in the farming sector and the scope for doing that by changing the way we raise the animals is much smaller than the scope we have by changing our diets.” The IAP report notes that in poorer countries meat, eggs and dairy can be important in providing concentrated nutrients, especially for children. It also says other things livestock can provide should be taken into consideration, such as leather, wool, manure, transport and plough pulling. The UN climate change conference, COP24, which starts on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, is an opportunity for political action, said Joachim von Braun, a professor who co-chairs the IAP project. “Our food systems are failing us. Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change.” Another member of the IAP editorial group, Aifric O’Sullivan, from University College Dublin, said: “We need to ensure that policymakers inform consumers about the climate impacts of their food choices, provide incentives for consumers to change their diets, and reduce food loss and waste.” The report recommends many actions that could help deliver the “whole-scale root and branch transformation” that is required, said Benton. These include crops that are more resilient to climate change, smarter crop rotation, soil protection, precier use of fertilisers and less use of pesticides. It also backs innovation such as laboratory-grown meat and insect-based foods."

"Younger adults are far less keen than older people on raising taxes to fund public services and want volunteers to help ease the growing crisis in social care, a survey shows. It reveals a stark generational divide over whether to increase taxation, with under-45s much less supportive than those aged over 45.  The results suggest that public support for tax rises to fund the NHS, and the health service receiving a growing share of public spending, may be eroded in the coming years. While overall 41% of the public believe taxes should go up to fund public services such as the NHS, just 33% of 18 to 24-year-olds and even fewer – 30% – of those aged between 25 and 44 agreed. In contrast, backing is strongest among those aged 45-54 (42%), 55-64 (46%) and over 65 (54%). Older age groups are also least likely to agree that “we should cut taxes and reduce spending on public services”. Only 8% of over-65s agree, whereas 21% of 25 to 34-year-olds think that should happen. The split between older and younger adults emerged in a survey of public attitudes by Populus. It carried out online polling of 2,096 UK adults for the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). “The NHS can’t afford to keep mitigating our failure to invest in what leads to good health: a welfare system that promotes economic security; investment in early years, education and skills; and better quality jobs for all,” said Ed Cox, the RSA’s director of public services and communities. Younger people have very different priorities than older age groups, Cox stressed. “Aside from a shared commitment to tackling inequality there is neither a clear consensus on tax increases nor agreement on how any extra money is spent. “The younger generations who’ll pay for increased spending see climate change and technological adaptation as greater challenges than the ageing society,” he added. Social care illustrates the chasm of opinion between the age groups. While 54% of over-65s see increasing taxation as the best solution, fewer than one in four of those aged 18 to 44 agree. A third of 18 to 24-year-olds think that much greater use should be made of volunteers, while just 14% of those of pensionable age concur. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK, stressed that while volunteers play a hugely important role, “they cannot and should not be asked to replace the vital work of trained care workers” and could not plug the gaps in the social care workforce. “Social care, just like the NHS, is an essential public service providing highly skilled support to people who are often living with complex needs or coming to the end of their life. “It needs sustainable funding, a well-trained and committed workforce and the capacity to work closely with health, housing and other vital services. As the majority of people in this survey recognise, putting funding on a sustainable footing is a vital first step.” Asked which policy areas the government should focus on over the next decade to make the UK a better country, those aged 45 and over identified inequality, the ageing society and social isolation and mental health. However, again under-45s offered a different set of priorities. While isolation did feature in their top three priorities, climate change was the biggest (48%) area of interest for 18 to 24-year-olds and also mentioned by those aged 25 to 44. For those under 45 international relations and Brexit were also key issues. Cox added that the findings showed that “traditional left-right politics is being flipped on its head, as under-45s back lower taxes and a smaller state, despite overwhelmingly voting Labour in the last election, while Conservative-leaning voters over 65 back higher taxes and spending”."

"The sweltering heat that hit the UK this summer was made 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change, a Met Office analysis has found. Scientists said the research showed global warming was already harming people’s lives and was not only a future threat.  Without rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, such heatwaves would happen every other year by mid-century, the Met Office said. Its analysis showed the average UK temperature during June, July and August was more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Hundreds more early deaths than usual occurred at the height of the heatwave, while farmers struggled for water and hay and thousands of houses suffered subsidence. The research was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, and the Met Office’s Prof Peter Stott, who led the work, said: “World leaders should be listening not just to scientists but also to the people who are being affected by extreme weather events right now. They are seeing it with their own eyes and suffering from it. Humanity just won’t be able to cope with the world we are heading for.” Stott said scientists were making links across the world between extreme weather events and climate change, from heatwaves in Japan to wildfires in California: “We’re seeing it happen again and again across the world. This whole sequence of events would not have happened without climate change.” Prof Mark Maslin, at University College London, said: “The analysis clearly shows climate change has already changed our weather patterns and is having adverse effects on people’s lives. It is beholden on all governments to take heed of these warnings and start cutting carbon emissions as quick as possible.” John Sauven, an executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “The link between climate change and extreme weather used to be a fingerprint, it now looks more like a smoking gun. The science is leaving world leaders nowhere to hide. They are the first generation of political leaders with a clear view of the precipice we’re heading towards and may be the last to be able to swerve away from it.” The heatwave showed the vulnerability of farming and food security to global warming, said Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union. “Our industry is on the forefront of climate change impacts. The summer heatwave was hugely challenging and should be a wake-up call for us all.” She said long-term drought policies were needed, such as making it easier to get planning permission for new reservoirs. The Met Office analysis used sophisticated computer models to estimate the probability of such a hot summer in the UK in a world with manmade global warming and in a world without it. If humanity’s fossil fuel burning had not more than doubled the CO2 in the atmosphere, there would have been a less than one in 200 chance of the 2018 heat. But in today’s warming world, the probability was one in eight. The 30-fold increased risk surprised Stott: “It is a large number, but we checked it very carefully.” The methodology used has been peer-reviewed and the new analysis would be, too, but the Met Office said it was important to make the information public as early as possible. Stott’s team also looked at the Central England temperature record which stretches back to 1659. They found just one summer, 1826, as hot as 2018 in the two centuries up until 1850, when CO2 emissions began to rise fast. In contrast, there have been two other summers just as hot as 2018 in the last two decades, in 2003 and 2006. An earlier analysis of the summer heat in Europe also found that climate change had increased its risk, though it looked at the hottest three-day periods, not the whole season. Scores of extreme weather events around the world, including droughts and severe rainfalls, have been linked to global warming, including the Storm Desmond downpour that caused extensive severe flooding in the UK."
"A star-studded progressive town hall on climate change drew thousands of viewers online and hundreds in person – but offered little insight into how the US left might overcome Republican opposition and lay the groundwork to limit rising temperatures. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and Democratic socialist congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned on a “Green New Deal”, elicited cheers with promises of an economic boom from massive investment in renewable power. “What we are trying to do tonight is be part of the revolution in terms of the need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and to not only save the planet but create millions of good-paying jobs in the process,” Sanders said. Ocasio-Cortez said the climate movement was “going to be the Great Society, the moonshot, the civil rights movement of our generation”. Speaking at the US Capitol, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez blamed corporations for taking advantage of people and oil and gas companies for ravaging the environment. Ocasio-Cortez said the media should cover the poor more. Van Jones, a cable news commentator, and Bill McKibben, founder of the environmental group 350.org, sat in on panel discussions. One young activist rapped about the environment. A woman in the audience draped herself in a monarch butterfly cape. “It is clear that it is the young people who are at the forefront of the movement,” Sanders said. Some of the young people came looking for specific solutions to push lawmakers to support. Two Texas college students majoring in political science said before the event began that they showed up to hear more about Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal. In the event, neither lawmaker discussed details or how to pursue them when Donald Trump has denied manmade climate change, planned to exit an international climate pact and slashed environmental protections. Speakers framed the conversation around work that could begin in 2020, if Democrats take back the Senate and the White House. But scientists say the world must have plans in place soon to avoid the worst of a heating Earth. Democratic leaders – even those who will soon be in charge in the House – do not have a strategy to ratchet down climate pollution. Ocasio-Cortez participated in a sit-in at the office of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, to urge her to come up with a plan. Pelosi has said she will pursue restarting a select committee on climate change. “It’s kind of a philosophical kind of goal approach. It’s not necessarily a specific policy,” said James Jackson, a student at the University of Texas in Tyler who wanted to learn about Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal. “I want to see what specific policies can make the elements of the Green New Deal come into fruition. We can say let’s have a jobs guarantee for green jobs but where are those green jobs going to be, who’s paying for them. I want to find those practical ways to enact the Green New Deal policies.”"

"Two great dramas are unfolding. One concerns the future trading status of a small, rich country, and is marked by febrile debate, political histrionics and inflated egos. The other sees the rest of the world trying to control climate change. The differences between the two shows could not be starker. The UN summit in Katowice, Poland, is a challenge for civilisation, for the benefit of the common good, an existential thriller for 7.5 billion people and all of nature which is being played out in relative calm. In contrast, in Westminster we are witnessing the culmination of a long-running political schism that is of much less consequence to the planet. Major studies have in the past few weeks made it clearer than ever that we are facing, in David Attenborough’s words at the opening of the summit last week, “a manmade disaster of global scale … our greatest threat in thousands of years”. First came a UN climate change special report, which showed how we may have only 12 or so years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which the risks of floods, drought and extreme heat will increase, and food shortages and poverty are likely for hundreds of millions of people. Then came a Global Carbon Budget study, which showed that, at current trends, the world is heading towards a catastrophic 3C of warming by 2100. An unseen revolution is taking place: from denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big To add gloom to the pessimism, some of the world’s biggest investors issued a stark warning to governments at the Katowice summit that failure to act urgently would result in financial catastrophe. And the UN’s World Meteorological Organization has provisionally confirmed that the past four years have been the hottest on record, and that extreme weather caused by manmade climate change now affects all continents. Taken together, these reports show conclusively that we are on the edge of climate breakdown, and that governments are failing to prevent it. Factor in the dramatic but linked decline in biodiversity, and the potential for collapsed ecosystems and mass extinctions, and we can see we are at an existential crossroads, heading inexorably towards a fatally denuded Earth. Some leaders, such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the incoming president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, say in wilful ignorance that all this science is wrong and that nothing needs to change – indeed forests must be felled and fossil fuels be further subsidised and promoted as “clean coal”. Others, such as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, do not deny the science but coldly calculate how much they would lose and try to water down commitments. In the middle at Katowice are the 10,000 government negotiators and NGOs trying to make rich countries reduce emissions and help poor countries adapt to inevitable climate change. But these UN climate talks depend on the consensus of all countries, so the progress appears incremental, even glacial. And because they do not involve adversarial politicians, they are considered unimportant by most of the world’s media. Beyond Katowice, though, are many millions of people who expect their leaders to act in the interests of all, and who are increasingly dismayed that the global economic system threatens everyone’s future. We are now in a race against time to address climate change. We have started late, the signs are not good, and the gap between high-level rhetoric and action to reduce emissions is widening. Fury is now building against governments, with the Extinction Rebellion climate protest group taking non-violent direct action, which has spread to 35 countries in just a few weeks. There are, however, lots of reasons to believe we can meet the challenge. This year, Trump’s decision to pull the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions has backfired. Not only did US emissions fall in 2018, many US states, cities and businesses said they intended to fulfil their Paris obligations. The transition to a less carbon-intensive energy system is also gathering pace. The share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by at least one-fifth in the next five years . By 2020 it should be cheaper to build new renewable energy plants in most countries than to keep coal or fossil fuels burning. Countries can already save money by retiring coal plants and substituting wind and solar. Soon only subsidies worth around £5tn a year will keep coal alive in many countries. Even more optimistically, the world’s largest developing countries are now in the forefront of the transition to lower emissions. India and China, with nearly a third of the world’s people, are at the forefront of the next solar revolution and, like Europe, are firmly on the path to decarbonisation. An unseen revolution is taking place in the way we power the world. From denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big. China is to build a giant solar park in the Gobi desert big enough to power 1 million homes; a single project in India will be even larger, covering 10,000 acres of Rajasthan, and one in the desert near Aswan in Egypt should deliver as much power as two nuclear power stations. The world is full now of major initiatives. Spurred by the commitments made at the Paris climate meeting in 2015, many countries, for example, are furiously planting trees; carbon capture and storage to take the emissions of fossil fuels is becoming a reality; millions of rice farmers have adopted the system of rice intensification which halves the water needed and reduces methane emissions from rice cultivation by up to 50%. These and many others are, so far, only incremental initiatives, coming far too slowly to even brake the warming. These are the seeds of change, lifting ambition, inspiring hope and showing the potential for change on a planetary scale. They also help politicians and bankers understand that getting to net zero emissions in just 40 years is technically and financially possible, and the best investment any country can ever make. By the end of the week, Britain may have weathered another political storm and people may be able to see a little clearer what is happening. Perhaps then our politicians will lift their heads and turn to address the greatest challenge any generation is ever likely to face. They will see that people are up for the challenge. If they then don’t respond with urgency, we are not just metaphorically in the soup, we may literally be cooked. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"
"Late on Sunday night, a tropical cyclone formed off the north Queensland coast. The storm has begun a track towards the coast, where more than 100 bushfires are still burning after week-long heatwaves and “unprecedented” conditions. Tropical cyclone Owen will bring some relief from the stinking heat; lower temperatures and rainfall that should help firefighters control the most threatening fires by midweek.  Queensland’s exhausted emergency services will not welcome Owen’s track towards the shore with any sense of respite; to them the blended ends of disaster seasons represent a horror scenario, but one many have seen coming. Paul Gray, a representative of the Queensland Firefighters’ Union, says the nature of bushfires has noticeably changed in recent years. The fires, he says, have become more intense and longer-lasting. Last week conditions in parts of Queensland were classified “catastrophic” for the first time. The rating has only existed since 2009, but no bushfire in the state since 1966, when warnings were first introduced, would have been considered so dangerous. “They’re always intense, but now you’re getting punished for days and days. Instead of a heatwave lasting one day, heatwaves are lasting four days or longer,” Gray says. “It makes it more difficult for fire crews to stand down, we lose the ability to rotate. Firefighters are working longer hours on protracted incidents for days at a time. There is an increasing need for out-of-state and overseas assistance, because it’s getting harder to relieve our own crews.” Australia, literally on fire. Via the @BOM_au satellite viewer: https://t.co/RO9nl9Y8U4 pic.twitter.com/ndpbJLQmth Australia’s devastating bushfires typically occur far to the south of the tropical Queensland rainforest. But Gray says the fire season in the north now lasts longer. That means a diminishing timeframe to allow emergency services to change tack from firefighting to battling cyclones and floodwaters, which historically have caused many more deaths and wider destruction in Queensland. “We have to turn around very quickly and go from a fire mindset to a floodwater mindset. We have to repurpose vehicles for a different kind of response. It used to be that you could predict when your storm or flood season would be, you’d predict when your fire season would be. “Climate change is having an impact on firefighting. There’s scientific data to back it up, but I like to think that because we are on the coal face that people are a little bit more aware of just how things have actually changed.” “Climate change is about unprecedented conditions becoming more probable,” says the climate scientist Lesley Hughes. “What was normal on average 20 years ago is not normal or average now. If you’re getting unprecedented conditions, that’s what climate scientists have been warning about.” The word unprecedented has been used repeatedly to describe Queensland’s weather this past week. Centuries-old heat records were broken in north Queensland, most remarkably in Cairns, where the hottest November temperature had been a 37.2C day in 1900. On Monday last week, Cairns was recorded at 42.6C. The following four days were all hotter than the previous record. “The strongest relationship between climate change and bushfires is the weather on the day,” Hughes says. “As climate change continues on, we continue to get increased average temperatures, that’s increasing the probability that we will get dangerous fire weather on any particular day.” In 2014 the Climate Council made six key findings about Australia’s fire season. That risk had increased; the fire season was becoming longer; fires were being fuelled by record conditions; the number of high-risk days would increase; communities should prepare for increasingly severe fires and “this is the critical decade”. “This is the new reality that people have to live and plan for,” Hughes says. Longer bushfire seasons in Australia and the US have already threatened to disrupt longstanding cooperation between the two countries, including sharing personnel, equipment and expertise. Changes to fire seasons have this week created a conflict between the lingering bushfire emergency in Queensland and the forecast of extreme conditions in Victoria. Crews from Victoria were sent north to assist, but the last will return south so their home state can be properly prepared. “Where once we might have shared personnel during bushfire periods ... that’s becoming less and less feasible because countries and states are needing those things at the same time,” Hughes says. “This does point to the need for more resources, as well as increasingly looking at planning regulations, looking at what people can build, having roads to get people out. It’s an example of how the change in risk due to climate change is affecting everything about our daily lives.” There is a kind of bushfire no one can survive; the sort we could barely conceive until a decade ago. Before the catastrophic Black Saturday fires in Victoria, which killed 173 people in February 2009, residents were advised they could choose to remain in their homes and defend their property. The mantra was leave early, or stay, in part to avoid the dangers of having people panic and flee with a fire front approaching. In Queensland last week, emergency services used modelling developed in Victoria after Black Saturday to launch several widespread evacuations. The largest was in the town of Gracemere, near Rockhampton, where about 8,000 people were told to go. Beau Dabron, the administration manager at the Gracemere Hotel, stayed in town. He and others watched traffic bank up in town and remain stationary for more than an hour, as people piled into cars and attempted the short drive to Rockhampton. “Once night time fell we had a good view from the pub towards Kabra ... there’s none of that glow, there was no flame. In our minds we felt we were fine. We slept with one eye open just to be safe,” he says. Was he worried that this fire could be different? “Most people have been through them before, so generally speaking people have something to expect. The fear set in when people said, ‘the whole town is going’.” The Tropic of Capricorn runs through Gracemere. Conditions turned when the tropical humidity suddenly dropped – combined with record high temperatures and fierce winds, the ingredients to fuel the most dangerous fires. Rachel Nolan, a fire ecologist from the University of Western Sydney, says climate change means conditions are drier, as well as warmer. “The two things are really tied together,” Nolan says. “When it’s warmer, that means the fuels are going to be drier. “There’s a couple of things that contribute to the risk of fire – the fuel load, the amount of material that can burn, and how dry that fuel is.” Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards cooperative research centre, says there has been a “long-term moisture deficit” on the Australian east coast that adds to the fire risk. “The whole of the east coast ... is pretty dry at the moment. The underlying condition is dry. What that means is that if you get a day that’s hot, that’s windy. ... it will burn with a ferocity.” Thornton says the Queensland fires are “another example of some of the extremes that are possible”. “It’s incredibly unusual, if not unknown, for these sorts of temperatures in this location. It’s pretty clear that something is changing in terms of fire season. “I think that what we’re seeing in Queensland is tragic for those who are there. For the rest of the country, who are coming into the beginning of summer, this is a real wake-up call saying, ‘Now is the time to prepare’.”"
"Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction targets and global greenhouse gas emissions are showing no signs of peaking, a new UN report has warned. In its annual emissions gap report, which looks at the gap between carbon reduction policies countries have in place and what is required to keep global warming to well below 2C, the UN says global emissions have reached record highs. It warns that about half of the G20 countries, including Australia, will fall short of meeting their nationally determined contributions under the Paris agreement and, even if they do meet them, they are still not ambitious enough to restrict warming to the levels needed. “Current commitments expressed in the NDCs are inadequate to bridge the emissions gap in 2030,” the report warns. “Technically, it is still possible to bridge the gap to ensure global warming stays well below 2C and 1.5C, but if NDC ambitions are not increased before 2030, exceeding the 1.5C goal can no longer be avoided.” Australia has committed to an emissions reduction target of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. The UN’s report says: “There has been no improvement in Australia’s climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the NDC target. “The latest projection published by the government shows that emissions would remain at high levels rather than reducing in line with the 2030 target.” The report finds that annual global emissions have reached a record high of 53.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. On current policies, it says, annual global emissions would hit 59 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2030. If countries met their unconditional 2030 targets they would hit 56 gigatonnes. To have a 66% chance of meeting the 2C Paris target, emissions would need to be down to about 40 gigatonnes a year by 2030 and to achieve the more ambitious target of 1.5C they would need to fall to about 24 gigatonnes. The UN warned that on current trajectories, the world was on track for about 3C of warming by 2100, with warming to continue after that. In a special report, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world was nowhere near on track to reach the 1.5C Paris target and that even a half degree more of warming would significantly worsen the risks of droughts, floods and extreme heat for millions of people. The new emissions gap report says G20 countries including Australia “will need to implement additional policies” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 2.5 gigatonnes a year to achieve their unconditional commitments under the Paris agreement. Despite the reports findings, Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Wednesday the government had “the right mix of scalable policies to meet our 2030 targets”. “Policies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation have led to emissions reductions in the electricity sector, for instance,” she said. “And they continue to deliver results. Wind and solar generation in the national electricity market is projected to increase by 250% over the next three years.” Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the report showed the government had been “hopeless” in taking action on climate change. “It is a slap in the face for Australians that the prime minister, environment minister and energy minister all repeat the lie that Australia will meet our Paris climate targets in a ‘canter’,” he said. “The government’s own data, and now the UN, show that under Scott Morrison’s hopeless climate change policies, carbon pollution will continue to rise all the way to 2030 – which is as far as the projections go.”"
"Late-night hosts discussed the recent Paul Manafort revelations and Donald Trump’s refusal to believe in climate change. Paul Manafort double flips, Trump spouts some climate change jibberish, and Ivanka gets confronted about her use of private email. pic.twitter.com/eTqSLWaIre On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked that the Russia investigation “is like a sale at a used Honda dealership. It never ends.” He spoke about Manafort “double-flipping” after agreeing to comply with Robert Mueller and then reportedly reporting back to Trump with the details of what had been happening. “It’s like when your friend takes a test in the second period then at recess he tells you what to expect when you go in for the test, although I bet even with the answers, Trump could still mess it up,” Noah joked. After a White House report that warned of extreme effects of climate change, Trump has remained opposed to the findings. “Like the climate, his arguments are getting worse,” he joked. In a rambling answer Trump claimed that as someone with such high intelligence, he found the report hard to believe especially as water and air were at a record clean. “Clearly the president doesn’t believe in the science and the English,” Noah said. Ivanka Trump has also been under fire for using a personal account to send White House emails. In an interview with ABC she defended the usage, saying that she wasn’t sending important work emails. “I actually believe her when she says she wasn’t using her private account for important work emails because in order to have important work emails, you have to do important work,” he said. He continued: “Her inbox is probably just Goop newsletters and thousands of unopened emails from Eric.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Manafort. “He’s afraid to rat on the Russians because he has a lifelong dream of continuing to live,” he said. “He’s got this bucket list of not ending up in a series of buckets.” He also referenced the exclusive findings from the Guardian on Manafort’s meeting with Julian Assange. “If this is true then this means the world’s palest man met the world’s shadiest man,” he said. Colbert continued: “OK, that looks bad but only because it is very bad.”"
"Trevor Noah took aim at Donald Trump for his refusal to believe a report on climate change assembled by his own government. On The Daily Show, the host spoke about the report, which states that climate change has already been having an effect on the US and is set to worsen over the next few decades. He showed a news report which focused on the potential loss of life but also underlined the economic effects. You know it’s a bad sign when the president has less respect for science than Maury Povich. pic.twitter.com/hdosTZ0Rno “I love how America always thinks about everything in economic terms,” he said. “Like even when they’re talking about the end of the world they’re like: ‘Climate change is going to kill everybody and that’s gonna cost us like a billion dollars.’” When asked about the report, Trump said it was “fine” but he didn’t believe it. “How can one man possess all the stupidity of mankind?” Noah asked. “It’s like they edited his genes to give him superhuman stupidity.” CNN brought on Rick Santorum to talk about the report and he claimed that the reason scientists continue to discuss the dangers of climate change is because they’re after money and need to sustain their lifestyles. “We should have known when we saw them balling in those Gucci lab coats,” Noah joked. He also showed clips from a panel on NBC in which one of the talking heads admitted that she wasn’t a scientist so she didn’t really know what she was talking about. “Once you say ‘I’m not a scientist’ then why is anyone listening to your scientific opinion?” he asked. Noah criticised the networks for bringing on climate change deniers and warned of the dangers. “Why does the news keep bringing on non-scientists to argue against science?” he said. TONIGHT: Are you looking to not have fun, then suffocate to death? Come join Elon Musk on Mars! pic.twitter.com/9HiAVtLktK There was also news that Nasa successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars as well as talk from Elon Musk that he was hoping to travel to the planet but warned that for any prospective colonists there were many dangers, including death. “Are you looking to not have fun and then suffocate to death? Come to Mars!” Noah joked. He continued: “It’s nice that Elon Musk is so upfront about the details. But you gotta admit, it would have been kinda funny if Elon Musk waited until they landed on Mars to be like: ‘Oh I forgot to mention, you are my space slaves now get to work building my base!’”"

"The world’s 1 billion people who live without electricity are not benefiting from climate change money promised by governments to help them develop. In theory, there has never been a better time for developing countries to install renewable energy such as solar or wind to combat climate change. The UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), along with the World Bank and regional development banks, have all said they intend to significantly increase their green energy financing, offering developing countries cheap loans and grants. Many donor countries like Britain and Japan have also pledged to help poorer nations switch to clean energy.  But as diplomats and organisations from 190 countries will hear this week at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, the reality is that the public money available is not nearly enough to meet their needs. Existing funds will not provide clean electricity for people who live beyond grids. The GCF, set up in 2010 to handle the money countries pledged to help the world adapt to climate change, is the great new hope for developing countries. But it has had a slow and torrid start, with rich countries backsliding on their pledges to fund it and poor countries bitterly complaining that international banks control the funds for their own profit. Last year Donald Trump cancelled $2bn (£1.57bn) of the $3bn promised to the GCF by former president Barack Obama. More recently, Australia has chosen not to contribute. “We now have 93 projects, worth $4.6bn. Thirty-nine projects, worth $1.6bn in GCF resources, are under implementation, and we expect to have disbursed around $483m by the end of the year,” said Simon Wilson, head of communication in the external affairs division of the Korea-based operation. Wilson says more than 40% of the GCF’s projects are micro- or small-scale investments of under $250,000. “Demand for climate finance already exceeds supply, and disbursement of funds for energy projects is expected to pick up quickly over the next few years,” he said. But Neha Rai, senior researcher at London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), said little international climate money is funding decentralised, or off-grid, energy. “Of the $14bn approved so far for climate finance worldwide, about 40%, or $5.6bn, has been marked for energy projects. But only 3% ($475m) has been allocated for decentralised energy. That is the equivalent of just $51m a year,” she says. Instead of accessing public funds from governments, developing countries must turn to commercial banks. But these, motivated by profit, are loth to provide money to what they consider risky projects. “For a [clean energy] proposal to be accepted by a bank, it needs hard data and a wealth of detail,” says Nathan Rive, a climate change specialist with the Asian Development Bank. “However, in many developing countries data on energy and emissions is sparse, unavailable or unreliable, making detailed project-specific climate assessments difficult.” The resulting bias toward more developed countries is stark. Of the roughly $333bn estimated by financial research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance to have been invested worldwide in renewable energy in 2017, nearly $280bn went to China, the US, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia. A handful of middle-income countries like Mexico and South Korea, India, Brazil and Egypt absorbed a further $28bn. The remaining countries attracted only about $25bn between them, despite having most of the people currently without electricity. Ironically, climate change may be making it even harder for developing countries to raise money for renewable energy projects. Particularly vulnerable ones, such as Bangladesh and small island states, must pay more to borrow because climate change is regarded by banks as an extra financial risk, according to a new UN Environment Programme–backed study. Researchers who examined the financial data of 48 countries, including Bangladesh, Guatemala, Kenya and Vietnam, found that vulnerable countries have had to pay an extra $62bn for capital over the past 10 years. “Climate vulnerability has already raised the average cost of borrowing to developing countries through higher interest rates. We expect the additional interest payments attributable to climate vulnerability to increase to between $146bn and $188bn over the next decade,” says Charles Donovan, director of the Centre for Climate Finance at Imperial College Business School. Consultants working with ministers and banks to raise clean energy finance say the world’s 47 least developed countries and the 39 small island developing states are barely on the financial map for clean energy. “There are major challenges in reaching least developed countries and small island developing states, due to a lack of sophisticated capital. As a result of this … renewable energy projects tend to be located in middle-income countries,” said Virginie Fayolle, a senior economist who leads climate finance at Acclimatise, a London-based consultancy which advises developing countries on how to access climate finance. Developing countries require a higher level of investment in infrastructure, such as small-scale, off-grid and decentralised projects, to reach more remote populations, said Ming Yang, a senior climate change specialist at the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which has provided a significant amount of money for small-scale electrification. Between October 1991 and August 2017, the GEF granted $1.19bn to 254 renewable energy projects. Of these, 43% are micro-grids, mini-grids or decentralised, said Yang. “The problem is not that there is not enough money. It is lack of political will. There is definitely institutional bias against poor countries when it comes to sustainable energy,” said Lidy Nacpil, coordinator of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development. “We see renewable energy as a public good and say that governments and international financial institutions should use public funds to take the lead in developing democratic renewable energy systems,” she said.

"Global carbon emissions will jump to a record high in 2018, according to a report, dashing hopes a plateau of recent years would be maintained. It means emissions are heading in the opposite direction to the deep cuts urgently needed, say scientists, to fight climate change. The rise is due to the growing number of cars on the roads and a renaissance of coal use and means the world remains on the track to catastrophic global warming. However, the report’s authors said the emissions trend can still be turned around by 2020, if cuts are made in transport, industry and farming emissions. The research by the Global Carbon Project was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, where almost 200 nations are working to turn the vision of tackling climate change agreed in Paris in 2015 into action. The report estimates CO2 emissions will rise by 2.7% in 2018, sharply up on the plateau from 2014-16 and 1.6% rise in 2017. Almost all countries are contributing to the rise, with emissions in China up 4.7%, in the US by 2.5% and in India by 6.3% in 2018. The EU’s emissions are near flat, but this follows a decade of strong falls. “The global rise in carbon emissions is worrying, because to deal with climate change they have to turn around and go to zero eventually,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia,who led the research published in the journal Nature. “We are not seeing action in the way we really need to. This needs to change quickly.” The current Paris agreement pledges from nations will only limit global warming to 3C, while even a rise of 1.5C will be disastrous for many people, according to the world’s scientists.  Le Quéré said: “I hope that by 2020, when [governments] have to come back with stronger commitments, we will then see a turning point.” The International Energy Agency’s data also shows rising emissions in 2018. Its executive director, Fatih Birol, said: “This turnaround should be another warning to governments as they meet in Katowice this week.” “Every year of rising emissions puts economies and the homes, lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk,” said Christiana Figueres, at the Mission 2020 campaign, who was the UN climate diplomat overseeing the Paris agreement. “We are in the age of exponentials,” she said, with renewable energy and electric cars expanding rapidly, but with the extreme weather impacts of climate change doing the same. “We have to ensure it is the solutions exponential curve that is going to win the race.” Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, said: “This annual balance sheet for global carbon is comprehensive and scientifically robust. Its message is more brutal than ever: we are deep in the red and heading still deeper. For all our sakes, world leaders must now do what is required.” Harjeet Singh, at ActionAid International, said news of the emissions’ rise should galvanise those at the climate summit: “There’s way too much complacency in the air at these talks.” The “dark news” of rising emissions is merging with two other alarming trends, according to Prof David Victor, at the University of California, San Diego, in an article with colleagues also published in Nature on Wednesday. Falling air pollution is enabling more of the sun’s warmth to reach the Earth’s surface, as aerosol pollutants reflect sunlight, while a long-term natural climate cycle in the Pacific is entering a warm phase. Victor said: “Global warming is accelerating. [These] three trends will combine over the next 20 years to make climate change faster and more furious than anticipated.” The Global Carbon Budget, produced by 76 scientists from 57 research institutions in 15 countries, found the major drivers of the 2018 increase were more coal-burning in China and India as their economies grew, and more oil used in more transport. Industry also used more gas. Renewable energy grew rapidly, but not enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuel. “There was hope China was rapidly moving away from coal power, but the last two years have shown it will not be so easy to say farewell quickly,” said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway. In the three years since the Paris agreement was signed, financial institutions have invested more than $478bn in the world’s top 120 coal plant developers, according to a report by the NGOs Urgewald, BankTrack and partners. Chinese banks led the underwriting of coal investments, while Japanese banks led the loans, the NGOs found. In the US, emissions rose as an unusually cold winter and hot summer boosted demand for both heating and cooling in homes. But it is expected that emissions will start to decline again in 2019, as cheap gas, wind and solar continue to displace coal – coal use has dropped 40% since 2005 and it is now at its lowest level since 1979. The global rise in emissions, even in rich, developed nations, is very concerning, said Antonio Marcondes, Brazil’s chief negotiator at the UN summit: “Emission reductions are like credit-card debt: the longer they are put off, the more expensive and painful they become.” Brazil reached its 2020 emissions targets early, but fears of a rise in deforestation under the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, could reverse this. But Le Quéré is optimistic that the rapid global rises seen in recent decades will not return: “This is very unlikely.”"
"Action to fight global warming is coming whether world leaders like it or not, school student Greta Thunberg has told the UN climate change summit, accusing them of behaving like irresponsible children. Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August. But more than 20,000 students around the world have now joined her. The school strikes have spread to at least 270 towns and cities in countries across the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the US and Japan.  “For 25 years countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions are continuing to rise. So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future,” she said. “I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.” “Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago,” she said. “We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with. We have to make our voices heard.” The conference of nearly 200 nations is taking place in Katowice, Poland, and its main task is to turn the vision of tackling global warming agreed in Paris in 2015 into concrete action. On Monday, Sir David Attenborough told the summit that without action “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”. Thunberg, who had a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday, said: “What I hope we achieve at this conference is that we realise that we are facing an existential threat. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced. First we have to realise this and then as fast as possible do something to stop the emissions and try to save what we can save.” On Tuesday, Guterres said: “Our younger generations will have to help drive, and complete, the work we start today. We need to harness their energy, invention and political power to raise climate ambition.” Toby Thorpe, a school student from Hobart, Tasmania, who took part in the recent school strikes in Australia and is also at the UN summit, said: “We are in this together. Together we are strong and we will not give up.” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, had dismissed the school strike – “the best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue” – but the Senate later approved a motion in support of the students. Thunberg said the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world was amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests was inspired by US school students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of school shootings. But initially her classmates refused to join in: “I had to do it alone.” The first two weeks of Thunberg’s strike were spent protesting outside the Swedish parliament. Now she spends every Friday on strike. “I like school and I like learning,” she told the Guardian. She said her strike would end when Sweden begins cutting its carbon emissions by a dramatic 15% a year: “Sweden is such a rich country and we have high per capita emissions, so we need to reduce more [than others].” She also had a message for other school students: “You don’t have to school strike, it’s your own choice. But why should we be studying for a future that soon may be no more? This is more important than school, I think.” Thunberg’s father, Svante, said: “As a parent you cannot support your child striking from school. I said to her you have to go out and do it for yourself.” But he added: “It’s OK in the holidays.” The Thunbergs are descendants of Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel-prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated the greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide emissions. Thunberg’s father was named after him, and said much of Arrhenius’s work has stood the test of time, but not everything. “He thought we’d be [at today’s levels of warming] in 2,000 years’ time,” said Svante Thunberg."
"For any tourist visiting Seattle, there’s the standard bucket list: ride the monorail, ascend the Space Needle, pay a visit to the world’s largest building, and, if you’re not squeamish about tax avoidance, check out the first-ever Starbucks and the Amazon Spheres. But, as I discovered on a recent visit, there’s a new attraction in town: the cannabis shops peppered through its downtown since Washington state legalised recreational marijuana.  They couldn’t be further from the smoke-filled coffeeshops of Amsterdam: this is very much America does weed. Show your passport at the door and you’re waved into a cheery space filled with brightly lit glass cabinets displaying their wares. Yes, there’s row after row of the little packets of greenish stuff you’d expect, with enticing names such as “Pink Lemonade” and “Chocolope”. But lots of other cannabis-infused goodies too: vape pens, pre-rolled joints and “edibles”, from brownies to jelly sweets to drinks. Budtenders are on hand to “talk flower” with discerning pot veterans, and chat with canna-curious tourists about the basics, such as the difference between the psychoactive THC, which produces a “mind high”, and the non-psychoactive CBD, which results in a healing “body high”. (Me: “But what’s the difference between a mind and a body high?” Patient budtender: “One makes your mind feel high, the other your body.”) It was fascinating talking to Washingtonians about what they’ve got right and wrong in regulating an industry from scratch. And as I tucked into my first vegan mockburger on the plane home – nicely pink inside, my tastebuds honestly couldn’t distinguish it from the real thing – it left me thinking, why are we so willing to wield the nanny state when it comes to cannabis but not something like meat, which does real social harm? If the goal of cannabis prohibition was to reduce social harm, it’s been an unalloyed failure. As even President Obama admitted, it’s safer than alcohol: it’s much less addictive than smoking or drinking. And while overdosing can be a deeply unpleasant, frightening experience, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd found when she consumed a whole chocolate bar that would have been better cut into 16, a fatal overdose is impossible. (There has been a handful of cases in the US where people have attributed extreme violence to ingesting cannabis, but the link between cannabis-induced psychosis and violence remains unproved – and, unlike alcohol, studies suggest smoking cannabis may be associated with lower levels of domestic violence). Where there are established risks – heavy cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic disorders – they should be set out so that, as with alcohol, people can make their own decision about whether they’re worth taking. Banning cannabis doesn’t stop people using – the industry in the US is thought to be worth $40bn a year, much of it black market, and in the UK, 2.2 million people are estimated to have taken cannabis. But a failure to legalise and regulate it makes it less safe than it need be – users have no idea of the psychoactive strength of what they’re buying on the black market, in stark contrast to the Seattle shops, which list the THC levels of every product. Prohibition also results in millions in lost tax revenue: California, the largest state to legalise recreational cannabis, collected more than $60m in cannabis taxes in the first quarter of 2018. Prohibition has had hugely unjust consequences. It disproportionately snares people of colour into the criminal justice system: in the UK, black people are around half as likely to report using drugs last year, but nine times more likely to be stopped and searched for drug possession and almost 12 times more likely to be convicted for cannabis possession. This should inform the way cannabis is legalised. In some places in the US, legalisation has been accompanied by expunging of historic marijuana misdemeanours, which can make it difficult to get a job or housing, from criminal records. Oakland in California has even reserved a proportion of its cannabis permits for those with a cannabis conviction in an attempt to combat the capture of the burgeoning weed industry by white, cash-rich businessmen. (Because cannabis remains federally illegal, it’s almost impossible for cannabis producers to secure bank loans.) But the reason we have prohibition is nothing to do with preventing social harm. It’s about the queasiness politicians feel about legalising something that they perceive still has a huge social stigma attached, even though the public is now firmly in favour of legalisation. Which brings me to the vegan burger. Take a step back and it seems bonkers that our political leaders hold firm on outlawing weed but seem loth to invoke the nanny state where it’s most needed: in avoiding catastrophic climate change. We won’t succeed in this unless we persuade people to fly less and eat less meat and dairy. That’s a gargantuan task, made harder by the demotivating knowledge that your own efforts are only likely to matter if others match them. Yet the most politicians do is half-heartedly conjure up a few green taxes in the hope they’ll nudge people in the sort of right direction. But they’re not effective enough, and also hit the poorest most. Time for the nanny state to get more radical. We should start by banning altogether things that have literally no function, such as bottled water in a country where it’s actually safer to drink tap water. And take a leaf out of wartime Britain – climate change is no less existential a threat – and ration activities such as flying and eating meat. If you’re not that bothered about a rare steak, you can sell your coupons to someone who can’t live without a good ribeye and feel smug as you tuck into your environmentally friendly, fake-meat alternatives. It’s perhaps not surprising that prohibition is based on social prissiness rather than rationality. But, my goodness, we’re missing a trick. We should follow Canada, which just became the second country to legalise recreational cannabis. And go after – if not banning, then rationing – the stuff that does society real, undeniable harm. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"
"Global temperatures have continued to rise in the past 10 months, with 2018 expected to be the fourth warmest year on record. Average temperatures around the world so far this year were nearly 1C (1.8F) above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather has affected all continents, while the melting of sea ice and glaciers and rises in sea levels continue. The past four years have been the hottest on record, and the 20 warmest have occurred in the past 22 years.  The warming trend is unmistakeable and shows we are running out of time to tackle climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization, which on Thursday published its provisional statement on the State of the Climate in 2018. The WMO warned that, on current trends, warming could reach 3C to 5C by the end of this century. “These are more than just numbers,” said Elena Manaenkova, the WMO deputy secretary general. “Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life.” The world has committed to keeping warming to no more than 2C above such levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said will cause the dieback of coral reefs, sea-level rises and extreme weather in many regions. Greenhouse gas levels were also recently found to be at record levels, and a UN report this week said the world must triple its emissions reduction efforts to stay within 2C – and to stay within 1.5C, those efforts needed to be five times greater. The IPCC found that continued rises in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 12 years could result in a breaching of the 1.5C limit. On Monday, the Met Office said summer temperatures in the UK could be 5C hotter by 2070, making this year’s heatwave the norm for the future, while winters could get much wetter. London could become increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding owing to sea-level rises, with the water level in the capital likely to rise by 1.15 metres by the end of the century. The WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest. The oceans have been absorbing record or near-record amounts of heat at certain periods. The year started with a weak La Niña event but by October there were signs of a return to El Niño conditions, which can raise global temperatures further. There were a greater number of violent storms than usual, including 70 tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere, compared with the long-term average of 53. Storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Vietnam, the Korean peninsula and Tonga, while hurricanes Florence and Michael caused substantial damage in the US. Wildfires raged in Greece, Canada, California and other areas, while floods devastated Kerala in India and displaced more than 1.4 million people. Japan also experienced serious flooding, as did east Africa. Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, a leading authority on climate change, said: “We are not on track to meet climate targets and rein in temperature increases. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher. “We are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it.” Manaenkova added that every effort to reduce greenhouse gases and the impacts of climate change was worthwhile. “Every bit matters,” she said, citing the harm done by temperature rises to every aspect of life, including economic productivity, food security, glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities. Jens Mattias Clausen, Greenpeace’s head of delegation at the UN climate change conference (COP24) in Poland, said: “The evidence, if we needed any more, continues to stack up. The record-high heatwaves, record-low Arctic sea ice, above average tropical cyclones and deadly wildfires are an alarm bell impossible to ignore. We’re in the midst of a climate crisis and this meteorological report spells out the worsening threat in startling clarity. It’s no longer our future that is in peril; our today is at risk. “The recent IPCC report also showed that we still have hope. We have 12 years to move the needle and any leader who comes to COP24 unprepared to step up and take action needs to read the WMO report and understand it’s time to stop talking and start acting on climate – while we still have the chance.”"
"High school students from across Australia calling for emergency action on climate change have travelled to Canberra to confront the prime minister after he criticised them for skipping school to stage national strikes. Students from Scott Morrison’s southern Sydney electorate of Cook – as well as Townsville, Melbourne and Brisbane – arrived at Parliament House on Wednesday morning to meet with him. Morrison said he would sit down with the school students. “I’m always happy to listen. I respect everybody’s views,” he told reporters on Wednesday morning. “We don’t always have to agree on everything, you know, but we do have to respect each other and we do have to take each other’s views seriously. “Whether that’s talking about climate, or whether that’s talking about energy, or whether that’s talking about the other difficult issues we’re dealing with in the parliament this week, you’ve got to respect everybody’s views, you can’t run their views down because they have them.” But one group of 11 students gathered out the back of Parliament House in the hope of speaking to Morrison had not yet had any luck. Fourteen-year-old Tully Bowtell-Young travelled solo from Townsville for the chance to share her concerns with the prime minister – using her own pocket money to help cover costs. “I think it’s worthwhile because nothing I have now is going to mean anything if I don’t have a future in this world,” she said. Students, first nations people, pacific islanders and young people are gathered in parliament house Canberra to demand climate justice! #fight4future #stopadani #auspol pic.twitter.com/qNSfB8JZ6r The striking students want federal policymakers to stop the Adani coalmine and move Australia from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy. They also want the government to respond to their 20,000-strong protests that were held across the country last week, says 16-year-old Aisheeya Huq. “We have been trying so much for the possibility of meeting with [Scott Morrison] but if we don’t get that opportunity after coming so far and going through so much to be here I think we will be a bit disheartened,” she said. The group of students tried numerous times to call the prime minister’s office but were told they needed to have a prearranged meeting organised – in some instances they were hung up on. Senator Jordan Steele-John and independent MP Kerryn Phelps both came out to meet with the students."
"The collapse of civilisation and the natural world is on the horizon, Sir David Attenborough has told the UN climate change summit in Poland. The naturalist was chosen to represent the world’s people in addressing delegates of almost 200 nations who are in Katowice to negotiate how to turn pledges made in the 2015 Paris climate deal into reality. As part of the UN’s people’s seat initiative, messages were gathered from all over the world to inform Attenborough’s address on Monday. “Right now we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,” he said. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” “Do you not see what is going on around you?” asks one young man in a video message played as part of a montage to the delegates. “We are already seeing increased impacts of climate change in China,” says a young woman. Another woman, standing outside a building burned down by a wildfire, says: “This used to be my home.” Attenborough said: “The world’s people have spoken. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now. Leaders of the world, you must lead. The continuation of civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend is in your hands.” Attenborough urged everyone to use the UN’s new ActNow chatbot, designed to give people the power and knowledge to take personal action against climate change. Recent studies show the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, and the top four in the past four years. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN. The COP24 summit was also addressed by António Guterres, the UN secretary general. “Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late,” he said. “For many, people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life or death.” Guterres said the two-week summit was the most important since Paris and that it must deliver firm funding commitments. “We have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos,” he said. He highlighted the opportunities of the green economy: “Climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better. Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey.” Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland, spoke at the opening ceremony, saying the use of “efficient” coal technology was not contradictory to taking climate action. Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal but has cut its carbon emissions by 30% since 1988 through better energy efficiency. Friends of the Earth International said the sponsorship of the summit by a Polish coal company “raises the middle finger to the climate”. A major goal for the Polish government at the summit is to promote a “just transition” for workers in fossil fuel industries into other jobs. “Safeguarding and creating sustainable employment and decent work are crucial to ensure public support for long-term emission reductions,” says a declaration that may be adopted at the summit and is supported by the EU. In the run-up to the summit, Donald Trump expressed denial about climate change, while there were attacks on the UN process from Brazil’s incoming administration under Jair Bolsonaro. Ricardo Navarro, of Friends of the Earth in El Salvador, said: “We must build an alternative future based on a just energy transformation. We face the threat of rightwing populist and climate-denying leaders further undermining climate protection and racing to exploit fossil fuels. We must resist.” Another goal of the summit is for nations to increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions; currently they are on target for a disastrous 3C of warming. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who led the 2017 UN climate summit, said his country had raised its ambitions. He told the summit: “If we can do it, you can do it.”"
"Outside of the desperate and the deluded, everyone knows that the world is in the early stages of a truly catastrophic climate change. As Sir David Attenborough told the UN climate change conference in Poland, “the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon”. We have even worked out, with scrupulous care, what we must do to avoid this or to mitigate the effects of climate change. We know what to do. We can see how to do it. There’s only one problem: we do almost nothing. Figures released today by the University of East Anglia for the conference in Katowice show that global carbon emissions will be higher than ever before this year. In fact they will rise by nearly 3%, an astonishing and terrifying annual figure at a time when the need to diminish them has never been more urgent. The main driver of this growth has been the increased use of coal, which is rapidly approaching its previous peak level, from 2013. There is a particular irony in that this conference is being held in Poland, a country that still derives 80% of its electricity from coal, even if this is less grossly polluting than it was in the Communist era. In fact emissions there are down 30% from their peak in 1988. But far more must be done. To limit global warming to the Paris agreement goal of 1.5C, CO2 emissions would need to decline by 50% by 2030 and reach net zero by around 2050.  All this destructive activity far outweighs the progress that has been made on the use of renewable resources. That is considerable, but so long as renewables are understood only as a pastime for the rich, they will be wholly insufficient to meet the problems before us. The Paris goal often looks like a drunkard’s resolution that everything will be different as soon as tomorrow comes. Everything has stayed much the same, and the balance of expert opinion is that three degrees is now more likely than the target figure of half that. It’s not just coal. China is now the biggest emitter of carbon, followed by the US and the EU as a whole, then India, Russia, and Japan. Oil use continues to grow. The worldwide demand for energy is outpacing efforts to deal its climate-altering side effects. In a characteristically greedy and destructive way, the Trump administration proposes to destroy one of the last great Arctic wildlife reserves in order to drill for oil there. The great oil-producing nations of Saudi Arabia and Iran both figure among the top 10 carbon-emitting countries despite having hardly any other components to their economies. Add to this the effects of deforestation in the Amazon, which will accelerate under the Bolsonaro government, and the future looks unimaginably grim. Climate change will exacerbate, as it already does, the world’s existing political and economic divisions. The most worrying feature of the latest UN report is the suggestion that the relatively good performance of the years 2014-16 in reducing carbon emissions was the result of an economic slowdown. The political consequences of the resulting discontent are with us still. They produced Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro and gravely weakened the EU. All those factors make a sane policy on climate change less likely. The purely physical feedback loops that drive climate change, such as the reduction of reflective ice surface, are now well enough understood. But it may be that the long-term message of the years since the Paris summit is that this understanding is not enough. We must also learn somehow to disrupt the political and economic feedback loops which are driving our civilisation to the brink of catastrophe."
"Time is up. The Liberal party won’t reform, so it is time to stop fighting, split and take the opportunity to compete for the support of the public. The Liberal party is now broken, brand-damaged and unable to attract new members that would enable it to represent a “broad church”. The failure of the existing Liberal party to address climate change or to support an integrity commission is unacceptable.  Nowhere is this failure more obvious than in its continued support for the Adani coalmine and new coal-fired power stations. I expected more from Scott Morrison after the Victorian walloping. Instead we get the very same. Slippery answers to everything. Coal, coal, coal and soaring greenhouse gas emissions. Refusing to reduce emissions as cheaply as possible is irrational, immoral and economically reckless. Achieving emission reductions of just 2% a year as proposed by the Labor party in the electricity sector costs very little and won’t risk system stability or security. We should be aiming for a 2% reduction in emissions every year to ensure Australia does its fair share to tackle climate change. Instead, emissions are increasing and are at a seven year high. Something must lie behind the failure of the Liberal party to accept policies that are economically rational and environmentally sound, so some sunlight from an integrity commission should be welcomed by all Australians.Wherever you look, something is wrong. The pursuit by ministers of baseload coal power when we need dispatchable renewable energy and storage. Claims by ministers that we need more fossil fuels and that they are cheaper than renewables or that clean coal is the answer. Claims by ministers that as Australia only emits 1.3% of global pollution we have no role to play, ignoring the fact that we are only 0.3% of the population and that we will be heavily damaged by the impacts of climate change. And the final insult – allowing the Adani coalmine to proceed when it lacks a social licence, is completely inconsistent with the need to tackle climate change and frankly smells with donations, overseas trips and wedding parties. We desperately need an integrity commission to investigate potential conflicts of interest that see a revolving door between the coal industry and minister’s offices. It is hard to believe donors don’t have influence on the selection of ministers to some degree. Members of parliament that are selected to be ministers stand to receive additional pay of more than $150,000, boosting their remuneration towards $500,000. It seems obvious that such ministers would be more likely to promote the views of the large donors that influenced their appointment in the first place. We need a parliament that accepts science. We need a parliament that respects our geography and rationally accepts that our neighbours and their views have special relevance and their concerns deserve special attention, just as my neighbours on my street deserve my special consideration. We need a root and branch review of the political remuneration system that ensures that it provides the right incentives for all politicians to work for the benefit of our country rather than fight against each other to secure the “spoils of government”. As a Liberal, I have had enough and, as evidenced by the swing in safe Liberal seats in Victoria, I am not alone. We must provide alternatives for Liberals to vote for at the next federal election, and I hope to see independent Liberals provide electors in safe Liberal seats with that choice. We need to return to the day where politicians know that their job is not to retain their job but rather to represent their electorate, who, if they are lucky, reward them with their job. The Liberal party brand has been so damaged and trust so completely destroyed that no amount of “shuffling the deck chairs” will change the outcome of the next federal election. It is simply impossible for many Liberal voters to vote for a party that: works to prevent any action on climate change has the potential to be controlled by the mining industry or whichever new industry is willing to pay for favours (clubs, internet gambling, pokies, firearms and many more) rejects the establishment of an integrity commission rejects donation reform and transparency and promotes members for their fundraising skills rather than policy and communication skills backs the Adani coalmine, which has no social licence and is inconsistent with our need to tackle climate change; and regardless of the election result seems to be heading towards installing Tony Abbott or Peter Dutton as the next party leader Liberal voters will align with independent Liberals who have real world experience, who will put the interests of their electorates first and who support:  tight fiscal responsibility so the country operates within its means strong border controls, backed by a compassionate approach to the treatment of refugees free enterprise and small business, balanced with appropriate regulation to ensure competition is fair transparency, integrity and trust; and real action on climate change that is consistent with what the science is demanding While I am sure many “shock jocks” who are doing daily damage to the Liberal party will yet again venture to their usual corner of scare tactics about the arrival of independent Liberals, there is no justification for that. Independent Liberals will move with transparency and integrity, and will clearly state their principals and beliefs so electors know what they are voting for. Just imagine how refreshing that would be in the current world of dark party politics where trading principles for position and power is considered a positive skill. Once the Liberal party reforms and rebalances, Liberal independents might elect to join again. • Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation"
"In a hallway beneath the UN climate change headquarters in Bonn, Germany, Sue Biniaz leans on a table, scribbling some thoughts on a piece of paper. It’s May 2018, three years after representatives from nearly 200 countries convened in France in an extraordinary display of international unity and agreed to keep global warming below 2C and to pursue a tougher target of 1.5C.  How the Paris climate agreement will achieve that remains an open question. The rules to govern the deal are due to be agreed at the next United Nations climate change conference in the coal-mining town of Katowice in south-west Poland in December. With the clock ticking, diplomats have gathered in the former West German capital for mid-year talks. Things are not going well. Negotiators rush in and out of adjoining rooms. In years gone by, Biniaz would have been at the centre of these meetings. From 1989 to early 2017, she was a deputy legal adviser at the US state department and its leading climate lawyer. She personally drafted key passages of the 2015 Paris accord. In global warming diplomacy, few are more respected. She still attends UN climate meetings, but only as an observer, with limited access to the behind-doors wrangling. So in Bonn she stands in a visible spot and the meetings come to her. “Hi Sue!” calls out Chinese negotiator Xiang Gao, who is standing alongside Andrew Rakestraw, a Trump state department official and Biniaz’s former colleague. Beside these sharp-suited hotshots, Biniaz is an elder: rimless oval spectacles, grey hair loosely pulled back. They fill her in, cracking jokes and sounding hopeful about the stream of talks they are co-chairing. Biniaz writes something down. Biniaz left the department in 2017 and took up teaching in the law schools of Columbia and Yale as well as a fellowship with the UN Foundation, a Washington DC philanthropic institution. She did so partly because she thought nothing as professionally enthralling as the Paris agreement could ever happen to her again. She also predicted, correctly, that the new president, Donald Trump, would renege on the deal. “I just did not want to be part of an administration that was going to take the position that this was a terrible agreement, because I don’t agree with that,” says Biniaz. At the UN Foundation she shares an office with two former colleagues from the Obama state department climate team: Julie Cerqueira and Jen Austin. Between them, Biniaz, Cerqueira and Austin cover the three arms of climate politics outside federal policy: international talks, local and state government, and the business sector. Austin is policy director for the We Mean Business coalition. Cerqueira leads the US Climate Alliance, an umbrella office for “subnational” governments who want to coordinate efforts to combat climate change. Turnover between administrations is a great Washington tradition, as party devotees slip into the private sector, thinktanks or lobbying firms. But the exodus from the state department climate team has been different, says Biniaz. “The number of people who have left has been kind of extraordinary and it’s definitely been not just because the administration changed, but it changed into an administration that was very hostile to both the Paris agreement and climate change action more generally,” she says. Cerqueira says: “A lot of civil servants gave up their nice state department or [Environmental Protection Agency] job or whatever because they are so committed to addressing climate change as fast as possible.” She loved her state job and regrets deeply the change in policy that drove her out. “You stay in the federal government as long as you feel like you can make a difference and as long as you feel like you can act in good faith and uphold your oath to the constitution,” she says, “and at some point you realise that you can’t do that any more.” As a result, the most effective diplomatic and legal outfit ever assembled in global climate politics is now spread through the thinktanks and environmental organisations of Washington DC. “Some people have been calling it climate diaspora,” says Biniaz. “It’s not an organised group. But to varying degrees we keep in touch because our work is related. Well, we keep in touch socially too of course, just because we are friends.” The 2015 Paris accord drew up the global system to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in only the broadest strokes. At just 27 pages long, it represents what could be agreed at the time. But interpreting the agreement into a concrete set of rules is proving an immensely complicated task. For example, the Paris deal asks all countries to submit their plans to fight climate change. But much is left open as to what those plans should cover, or how often they should be updated, using which metrics and baselines, and how much leeway should be given to poor countries with bad data. These questions can all be split into increasingly finer details, with such eventual complexity that in many negotiating parties, the lead diplomat has only a rudimentary understanding of what their staff are working on. Consensus is proving difficult to find. If it is ever agreed, the “Paris rulebook” will iron out these technical, in some cases toxic, details. Without it, the deal will collapse. It is over these troubled waters that Biniaz keeps watch in Bonn. Using intelligence harvested from old contacts, she keeps track of which parts of the talks are in most trouble. When they become stuck, Biniaz arranges small, informal gatherings of key negotiators to try to unblock them. One evening Biniaz held an after-dinner session. “People are in a better mood when they are fed,” she says. Diplomats sat behind nameplates bearing their own names, instead of the name of their country. These meetings are private and completely off the record. Biniaz believes the relaxed setting can help adversaries “inch toward a point of view”. Biniaz has hosted at least five such meetings, held with the assistance of the Paris-based Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), on the margins of the busy 2018 negotiating calendar. These have usually focused on the area of the talks Rakestraw and Xiang oversee, which covers what information countries must provide as they report their efforts to cut carbon pollution. The role is neutral, but there is one ironclad principle under which she operates: the deal cut in Paris is not up for negotiation. There is an undercurrent at the talks that is disturbing the former US diplomat, who says there are serious attempts afoot to write rules Biniaz thinks “ignore the language” agreed in 2015. Based on legal language Biniaz helped to draft, Barack Obama and Xi Jinping agreed to universal rules that gave flexibility for the poorest countries. That compromise is credited with making Paris possible. It was good for small, vulnerable nations that feared China’s gigantic future emissions. But for emerging, coal-dependent economies it was hard to swallow. Hence their efforts now to reverse the deal and the possibility that a dual deal could be reached in Poland under which China is subject to different rules than the US. A group of developing countries, spurred by US betrayal and most likely coaxed on by China, are now trying to create one set of rules for the rich and one for the poor. This approach would govern China’s massive emissions more loosely, which would be unacceptable to the US and EU. If talks fail to produce a rulebook in Katowice over the coming weeks, it will be over this. It does not help that US diplomatic influence over climate change has collapsed under Trump. Just three years ago the Obama state department, with Biniaz as its lieutenant, ran the show. The Trump administration diplomats who still turn up to negotiate are tolerated, but their power has evaporated. As an Obama diplomat, Cerqueira built alliances between countries with similar interests. In her new job, the international experience has come in handy. As cooperation and dialogue on climate change with the US federal government has dried up, other – usually European – nations have sought diplomatic connections with governors and mayors across the US. Cerqueira is often their first call. When the UK and Canadian governments began gathering names for a global pact to end coal power, she says, “they wanted to coordinate on the recruitment of states into the alliance and so we are like a natural fit”. So far, seven US states and two cities have signed up. A short ride across town from the UN Foundation is the Brookings Institution, where Todd Stern has taken up a fellowship. If Biniaz was the driving intellectual force behind US efforts in Paris, Stern, as Obama’s special envoy for climate change, was its voice and face. His relationship with China’s lead negotiator and government minister Xie Zhenhua was a crucial factor when talks hit the skids in the final hours. The final draft contained a single word – some claimed it was a typo – the US found unacceptable. As the talks threatened to unravel, Xie stepped in, backed the change the US demanded and the gavel came down. Unlike many of his staff, Stern had no intention of staying on after the Paris deal was struck. He had had enough of the constant travel, the time away from his three children. He began packing up his offices and in May 2016, after striking a final bargain with his old friend Xie for the US and China to ratify the agreement together, he departed. Like Biniaz, he had agreed to teach a course at Yale. He was thinking about writing a book: the story behind the global accord. He was not thinking much about the ongoing negotiation of the Paris rulebook; certainly he didn’t imagine getting involved. Then Trump won.  “I really had been assuming that Clinton was going to win,” he says. Initially, Stern thought “wiser voices in the room” would convince Trump to remain in the Paris agreement. “Obviously that changed over time.” But he knew immediately that “it wasn’t good and we weren’t going to see anything like a bona fide climate change effort internationally or domestically”. In September 2017, a few months after Trump had announced his intention to leave the Paris deal, Stern travelled to New York to talk to old contacts as they gathered for the UN general assembly. He wanted to find out what other countries were thinking. How would the negotiations on the Paris rulebook, so critical to its function, be conducted with US leadership stripped away? Word of the binary system being pushed by China and its allies was circulating. This was something Stern and Biniaz believed they had buried in Paris. If US climate diplomacy has had a defining theme over years and across presidencies, it is that its great rival China must be bound by the same conditions. If December’s talks deliver a dual rulebook, it could stop the US rejoining the deal under a different president, says Biniaz. Neither Stern nor Biniaz denies that making sure this doesn’t happen is guiding their involvement. Six current and former non-US diplomats interviewed for this story said they thought this was at least partly their goal. Certainly, Stern heard enough in New York to continue turning up. Over the past two years he has dropped in to most major meetings. He lunches and listens and tactfully gives his views. His book has made little progress. His travels have included a visit to Beijing in May this year, where Xie hosted him at Tsinghua University. The two spent a lot of time together, says Stern, talking about the state of the negotiations. “My lodestar is: what is the way in which we stay faithful to the Paris agreement?” he says. “Not what does the US want or not, because I can’t speak for the US, and it won’t come as a surprise to you that people aren’t all that interested about what the US likes or doesn’t right now.” A senior diplomat from a developing country told the Guardian, speaking under condition of anonymity: “Some would say Todd and Sue are trying to keep the whole thing from crumbling. Others would say they are trying to keep some soft power for the US. Others could say they want to still feel relevant, or make sure that their vision of what the Paris agreement should be prevails.” The US vision of the Paris deal is, broadly, what Obama’s state department got from Paris. They wanted voluntary targets, rather than ones that were in line with their historical responsibility for creating climate change. Once set, countries’ pledges could not be legally binding, or the US Senate would reject them. The world accepted the rule of the Senate. These priorities arguably weakened the power of the deal to cut emissions. Certainly the current paucity of these voluntary efforts (which are supposed to increase over time, at a pace determined by each government) means the world remains on a path to warming well beyond 2C.  Meanwhile, Trump has argued that Paris “demeaned” the US; that Obama was stitched up; that China will go on building coal plants (it will) while the US cannot (it can, but doesn’t need them). Despite Trump’s radical reversals of domestic climate policies and threat to withdraw from the deal, his state department still turns up to the negotiations. The US cannot formally leave the Paris agreement until 2020, coincidentally on the day after the next US election.  The state department continues to advocate the same positions it has for years: common rules, non-binding, voluntary targets. A US department spokesperson said its priority was “to ensure a level playing field” – code for tying China to the same rules as all others. Of course, by flagging his intention to leave, Trump has significantly weakened his diplomats’ chances of protecting these goals. Because of this, Obama’s most senior climate advisers, who devised great chunks of the Paris accord, are now working in the shadows to defend a vision of the deal that is broadly in line with the efforts of the defanged Trump state department.  “It’s stupid to think that we would regard them [Stern and Biniaz] as the progressives,” says a former negotiator for a small island nation, noting that in Paris the US had been forceful in cutting off the most vulnerable countries on Earth from any form of reparation for damage they will incur from climate change.  When countries meet in Katowice this month, Biniaz and Stern will be there. In the final days of the two-week marathon, negotiators will hit a wall. Issues they cannot agree on will be handed to ministers. At that point Chinese and US intransigence could hamper the Paris agreement. “Who will China’s climate chief Xie turn to in that moment?” asks Greenpeace adviser Li Shuo. Stern’s old job at the state department no longer exists. The US delegation will not have anyone at Xie’s ministerial level who knows the deal like Stern.  For the most vulnerable nations on Earth, Trump’s election has had a little recognised, but insidious impact. In climate terms, it has shifted the emphasis away from improving the Paris agreement to defending it. Stern and Biniaz may well help rescue the deal, but will they want to make it more just?

"Governments often try to win elections by fighting the last one again. And to an extent you can understand it – after all, they did win it. But this week the prime minister adopted a rather more bizarre strategy of trying to win the next election by fighting the 2007 election over again. It is about as likely to result in victory for Scott Morrison as it did the first time round for John Howard. In Monday’s question time, the Morrison was at his shouty worst. Coming off the Victorian state election drubbing, the government MPs were hardly in a jocular mood and yet, oddly, Morrison decided to attack the opposition by invoking one of the more infamous jocular moments in Australian politics.  After railing at the ALP benchers for being “very cocky” he suggested that there was a warning ahead for voters, and it came in the form of Peter Garrett. Yes, a man who left parliament five years ago. The prime minister cast his mind back to 2007. The ALP were leading in the polls and Garrett had a conversation with Steve Price in Melbourne airport, in which in response to Price’s suggestion that it was “turning into the ‘me too’ election campaign”, Garrett replied, “Oh, don’t worry about that. Once we get in we will change all that.” Garrett later told the media that he was not serious and that it was just “a casual conversation, jocular in manner.” On Monday Morrison took us back to that time, telling parliament “I’ll never forget what Peter Garrett said back before the 2007 election. We all remember it. While they were all trying to pretend there wouldn’t be anything dramatic, that they would just be John Howard-lite if Kevin Rudd were elected, Peter Garrett let the cat out of the bag when he said, ‘We’ll change it all.’ That’s what the leader of the opposition’s plan is. That’s what the Labor party’s plan is. They want to change it all”. Such history lessons are always quite fun, if only to recall that “me too” now has a very different meaning from the one ascribed to the Rudd strategy of being Howard-lite. Yet, ironically, “me too” remains part of this election campaign – except now in its current meaning. The greater empowerment women feel, and their utter lack of patience with being told by those in power that changes take time, has meant the position of parties on gender issues is now a strong player in how people vote. And the Liberal party knows it – Kelly O’Dwyer was reported to have told colleagues this week that voters saw the party as “homophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers”. Gee, I wonder why? This week in the Senate, the LNPs Barry O’Sullivan said of Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young that she had “a bit of Nick Xenophon in her” and his fellow senator Ian MacDonald responded to Greens senator Larissa Waters wearing a pair of earrings that said “Stop Adani” by asking the Senate if he could wear his “coal hi-vis jacket”. And then of course there was the minister for resources, Matthew Canavan, who responded to the news that the Adani coalmine would begin construction (albeit on a much smaller scale than previously proposed) by tweeting reference to the bushfires in central Queensland caused by extreme heat conditions and referring to Adani as a “little Aussie battler”. The problem with Morrison’s reference to the 2007 campaign is that there are a number of things the same, but also much that is different, and none helps the government. Back then the Liberal party sought to engage in fear and also hoped that budget surpluses would be enough to have people overlook other economic concerns such as industrial relations. It didn’t work. Now we again see the Liberal party clinging to the budget surplus as the ultimate aim of any government. The prime minister this week announced the date of next year’s budget and that it would be in surplus. He and the party hopes this will be enough to counter any concerns about flat real wages growth over the past four years. Thus far the polls suggest it is not working. The big difference is that in 2007 the presumed fear was that the ALP would get in and change everything; now the real fear is that it won’t. Morrison suggesting that if the Labor gets in it’ll change everything is actually a free ad for the ALP. The worry is that Labor’s big talk of change will become, once in government, a repetition of the same. For example, Labor’s energy policy is basically a resurrection of the Liberal party’s national energy guarantee – albeit with much greater emissions reduction targets. As Katharine Murphy has rightly noted, so damaged has climate change policy become in this country that the reformed Neg is probably a smart ploy. But all the same, it is hardly the bold policy that is needed. On Friday the latest greenhouse gas emissions targets were released. And, once again, total emissions (excluding land use, land use change and forestry) rose, the annual level of greenhouse gas emissions jumping 0.6% - the biggest quarterly jump in over 13 years. 2007 was also an election that featured climate change – indeed, it was an issue that severely wounded the government, as under Howard the Liberal party was lost in a haze of denialism and wilfully ignorant intransigence. Once again climate change politics is back in a big way. The extreme temperatures and early start to the bushfire season have placed the LNP’s policy shambles on the issue in the spotlight. The demonstrations by school students this week is the work of a generation holding their elders in rightful contempt. Their voting parents may not have also taken to the streets, but the Victorian election showed they have had enough of the LNP’s inability to even come up with a plausible energy policy that deals with climate change. The 2007 election was one where the economy was growing well and the budget was in surplus, and yet the government was caught out on issues of workplace relations and climate change and was seen to be out of touch with the way the times were headed. It is not an election that members of this government should wish to recall. And if Morrison believes the best tactic is to make people afraid the ALP will change it all once they get in, then he might as well give Bill Shorten the keys to the Lodge right now. Not only do voters not want Shorten to be Morrison-lite; the problem for the government is they don’t particularly want Morrison and what his party stands for either. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Rising sea levels could become overwhelming sooner than previously believed, according to the authors of the most comprehensive study yet of the accelerating ice melt in Greenland. Run-off from this vast northern ice sheet – currently the biggest single source of meltwater adding to the volume of the world’s oceans – is 50% higher than pre-industrial levels and increasing exponentially as a result of manmade global warming, says the paper, published in Nature on Wednesday. Almost all of the increase has occurred in the past two decades – a jolt upwards after several centuries of relative stability. This suggests the ice sheet becomes more sensitive as temperatures go up. “Greenland ice is melting more in recent decades than at any point in at least the last four centuries, and probably more than at any time in the last seven to eight millennia,” said the lead author Luke Trusel, of Rowan University. “We demonstrate that Greenland ice is more sensitive to warming today than in the past – it responds non-linearly due to positive feedbacks inherent to the system. Warming means more today than it did even just a few decades ago.” The researchers used ice core data from three locations to build the first multi-century record of temperature, surface melt and run-off in Greenland. Going back 339 years, they found the first sign of meltwater increase began along with the industrial revolution in the mid-1800s. The trend remained within the natural variation until the 1990s, since when it has spiked far outside of the usual nine- to 13-year cycles. Greenland currently contributes about 20% of global sea-level rise, which is running at 4mm per year. This pace will probably double by the end of the century, according to the most recent models used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. How the new study affects those projections will be the subjects of future study by the authors. If all the ice in Greenland melted, it would raise sea levels by seven metres. At the current pace that would take thousands of years, but the ongoing acceleration could bring this forward rapidly. “At some point, sea-level rise will be too fast for us to adapt to, so we really have to avoid this situation by reducing emissions,” said the study’s co-author Michiel van den Broeke of Utrecht University. “I think this is one of the many wake-up calls that we have had in the last few decades. It clearly links manmade global warming to sea-level rise.” The research comes out as policymakers from around the world are attending UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, where governments are trying to set new rules to keep global warming to between 1.5C and 2C. The authors said the paper underlined the dangers of exceeding even the lower figure. “On a personal level it is worrying to see this – along with the vast array of other scientific evidence showing that we’ve entered unprecedented or exceptional times,” said Trusel. “The ice has no political agenda – it either grows or melts. Today it is melting as humans have warmed the planet. The ice sheets have tipping points, and how quickly they impact our livelihoods through sea level rise depends on what we do now and in the very near future.” Other academics, uninvolved in the paper, said the new study was an important confirmation of what scientists have long suspected: that the recent increase in ice melt is ominously unusual. “The Greenland ice sheet is like a sleeping giant who is slowly but surely awakening to ongoing global warming, and there are surprises in its response. However, the response may be more rapid than previously believed,” said Edward Hanna, professor of climate science and meteorology at the University of Lincoln."
"The Trump administration published a major report on climate change the day after Thanksgiving. We will explore the key findings each day this week. Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally. The Guardian will explore key findings from the report each day this week.  Climate efforts aren’t all or nothing Limiting greenhouse gases would substantially benefit the US economy and stop thousands of deaths each year, compared with allowing climate pollution to continue to rise through the 21st century. Reaching a peak for climate pollution mid-century and then beginning a decline would prevent in 2090: 48% of the $155bn per year in damages to labor 58% of the $141bn per year in lives lost on extremely hot or cold days 22% of the $118bn per year in damages to coastal property 31% of the $26bn per year in the health consequences from poor air quality 59% of the $20bn per year in damages to roads 47% of the $8bn per year in inland flooding The earth would continue to warm even if humans stopped producing greenhouse gases from power plants and cars today. But limiting – if not entirely eliminating – that pollution would substantially reduce risks. Cutting greenhouse gases would provide the biggest benefits in the latter half of this century. “In the absence of more significant global mitigation efforts, climate change is projected to impose substantial damages on the US economy, human health, and the environment,” the report says. “Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. It is very likely that some physical and ecological impacts will be irreversible for thousands of years, while others will be permanent.” Ocean warming, for example, is causing coral bleaching around the world. If greenhouse gases rise through the century, nearly all coral reefs will be surrounded by acidified seawater. Reaching a peak for manmade greenhouse gas growth by the middle of the century in the US would also avoid up to tens of thousands of deaths per year from extreme temperatures and up to thousands of deaths per year from poor air quality."
"A Trump administration presentation extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the UN climate talks in Poland has been met with guffaws of laughter and chants of “Shame on you”. Monday’s protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation, which used its only public appearance to promote the “unapologetic utilisation” of coal, oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming, the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries. The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power, including Wells Griffith, Donald Trump’s adviser on global energy and climate, Steve Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department, and Rich Powell, the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on “conservative clean energy”. The only non-American was Patrick Suckling, the ambassador for the environment in Australia’s coal-enthusiast government. None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming, focusing instead of “innovation and entrepreneurship” in the technological development of nuclear power, “clean coal” and carbon capture and storage. Ten minutes into Griffith’s opening speech, he was interrupted by a sudden, sustained, loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of “It’s not funny”, and then a series of chants of “Keep it in the ground” and “Shame on you”. Several campaigners read statements. “There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal, I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung, and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now,” said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America. After the protesters were led away by security guards, Griffiths said: “In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground, but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible”. This statement was contradicted by climate analysts, who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1,400 more deaths per year will result from Trump’s proposal to replace the Clean Power Act. “It’s ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels, while dismantling standards that would do just that,” said Dan Lashof, the director of the World Resources Institute. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants.” Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and was producing more petroleum than ever. “To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty, all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically,” he said. Echoing a claim often made by Trump, Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth, while allowing China to operate with high emissions. This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks, underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017. The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015, but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017, Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year, his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the world’s scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. None of the panelists would be drawn on the study, but Griffith spoke out against “alarmism” that, he claimed, displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact, scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative, while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users. Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small, modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy-efficient and have near-zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US, he said they could be exported to other countries. “They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrow’s coal technology to improve energy security,” he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite this public commitment, the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper, according to Nathaniel Keohane, the senior vice-president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group. “Trump is playing politics, but it’s not changing the facts on the ground,” he said. “Coal usage in the US just hit a 39-year low. If we really want to protect our economy, we’ll move aggressively toward 100% clean energy.” An alternative, non-official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city- and state-level governments, business executives and religious leaders, the “We’re still in” group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support. Nonetheless, many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. “I was completely embarrassed to be an American”, said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. “Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I can’t believe they are putting profits over the planet, and profits over people.”"
"Economic migration from Africa to Europe driven by poverty could double in the next decade unless urgent investment is made in job creation for young people in rural areas, the head of a UN financial body has warned. The global population is forecast to reach 9.9 billion by 2050 – a 29% increase – with most of that growth in Africa, where the population is expected to double to 2.6 billion.  Gilbert Houngbo, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said that with 60% of Africa’s young people living in rural areas, global leaders need to prioritise investment in their futures to curb forced migration, feed a growing population and help smallholder farmers – who are facing the added burden of climate change – become not only self-sufficient but profitable. In an interview with the Guardian, he said: “If today Europe is struggling with economic migration [driven by poverty], can you imagine the extent of migration 10 years down the road with the African population set to double?” He acknowledged that while 80% of African migration occurs within the continent, migration from Africa to Europe is increasing. “It’s very simple,” said Houngbo. “If we do not take decisive action now, expect migration levels to double both within Africa and to Europe. That projection makes me very concerned and European nations and UN member states should be thinking about investing in rural transformation.” The former prime minister of Togo added: “For three years in a row, the state of food security and nutrition report shows that the level of food insecurity and malnutrition has been going up after decades of decreasing. “If those investments are not there at a time when climate change is also a pressure and when the population is growing then it is very clear that parts of the world will be left facing risk of famine.” Houngbo – in the UK to give a keynote speech at Chatham House – said a holistic approach is vital to prevent Africa’s young people being forced to migrate to urban areas or other countries because they are economically disadvantaged. “Investment in sustainable farming is essential for the livelihoods of those in rural communities and for food security but it is not enough to engage the younger generations,” he said. “That is why we need to look at the bigger picture – the priorities are decent schools, potable water and basic healthcare. I also consider access to WhatsApp to be a basic service. Young people need access to modern technology.” He said developing renewable energy would also be a consideration as some local grids are not up to the job. “If you cannot charge your cellphone or laptop, it’s difficult to do business.” Smallholder farms produce 50% of all food calories on 30% of the world’s agricultural land. In sub-Saharan Africa, 80% of all farms are small-scale. Their productivity varies but they are generally characterised by growing subsistence crops and one or two cash crops on a small plot and relying almost exclusively on family labour, with women playing a vital role. With the right approach, smallholder farms can be turned into profitable businesses that supply local and national markets, generate surpluses and offer communities a pathway out of poverty and hunger, according to Ifad, the UN’s financial institution dedicated to rural areas. Action is needed by national governments, the development community and private sector partners to create the right conditions to make this possible, said Houngbo. His organisation is due to announce plans for an investment fund for young people in rural areas, available globally, but targeting young people in Africa. He said the sums would be in the region of $10,000 (£7,835) to $20,000, up to $1m – greater than the sums offered by microfinance institutions, but amounts that young people would find difficult to borrow from a bank. Ifad also wants to encourage rural startups and smallholder farms to develop resistance to climate change. The number of hungry people globally has risen for the third year in a row because of climate variability. It is currently field-testing a pilot called Cachet, which operates a hedging mechanism to protects smallholders against price volatility. It is already assisting small-scale producers of cocoa in Nigeria and maize in Senegal and aims to scale up to reach more beneficiaries in low- and middle-income countries. The scheme protects farmers against selling at a loss. Next year it will expand to use finance schemes to transfer climate-related risks. Investment in training and empowering women in rural areas is also vital to the transformation of rural economies. Research has shown that if women were to have the same access to agricultural resources as men, about 150 million fewer people would go hungry. Half of Ifad’s beneficiaries are women who struggle to access finance and land, and face challenges around inheritance and entitlement. “It’s not just about training the women, it’s about their ability to have a voice in rural life … it is essential they’re part of decision making,” said Houngbo. “It’s about changing policies and family law so women can attain equal rights. Also, it is one thing to change laws but enforcing them in rural areas can be very tricky if society has not bought into it.” Irene Nantale, 30, a local entrepreneur from Mashiaga village in Uganda’s eastern Mayuge District, was part of Ifad’s Project for Financial Inclusion in Rural Areas initiative and is testament to what women can achieve with small loans. Houngbo said her family had been struggling before she joined a savings and credit cooperative in 2013 and used her first loan to buy 50 chickens and a cow. When Houngbo visited Nantale in May she had 350 chickens, four cows, 12 goats and two employees on her farm. She had also invested some capital in opening a pharmacy in the village, filling a vital gap in local services. She plans to use her savings to send her three children to university. “We are looking beyond being food secure – we also want to generate income and profits,” explained Houngbo. The 57-year-old is no stranger to life in a poor farming community. Growing up in rural Togo, he became accustomed to missing meals and combining education with hard labour. Aged 11 he left his village because his father wanted to give him a better education in the capital. “I lived 240km away but every weekend and in the holidays I would go back to work on the farm. Vacation to us meant farming, it wasn’t a holiday,” said Houngbo. “I know what it’s like to live on one meal a day. But it is shocking to think that 50 years on that still exists in parts of the world. To me that is unacceptable and every day I have to ask myself if I’m doing as much as I can to help avoid that.”"
"Tackling climate change would save at least a million lives a year, the World Health Organization has told the UN climate summit in Poland, making it a moral imperative. Cutting fossil fuel burning not only slows global warming but slashes air pollution, which causes millions of early deaths a year, the WHO says. In a report requested by UN climate summit leaders, the WHO says the economic benefits of improved health are more than double the costs of cutting emissions, and even higher in India and China, which are plagued by toxic air.  “The global public health community is getting very impatient,” said María Neira, WHO director of public and environmental health. “If you don’t think you need to take action for the sake of climate change, make sure when you think about the planet you incorporate a couple of lungs, a brain and a heart. It is not just about saving the planet in the future, it is about protecting the health of the people right now.” The damage caused by coal, oil and gas pollution is “outrageous”, she said. “There are words not included in the documents at [the climate summit]: asthma, lung cancer, stroke, heart disease – they need to be incorporated in all the decision-making processes.” “Morally, delaying the [clean energy] transition is being responsible for millions of deaths every year,” Neira said. “[Leaders] need to ask themselves how many deaths are [they] willing to accept. When health is taken into account, climate action is an opportunity, not a cost.” Air pollution is the best known impact of fossil fuel use, and climate change damages health through heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, increased spread of infectious disease and the destruction of health facilities. Global warming is also damaging crops and reducing their nutritional value, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization now reporting a rise in the number of hungry people going up after decades of decline. “We now have scientific evidence that people are suffering and dying from climate change,” said Prof Kristie Ebi, at the University of Washington and lead author on the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) report, that warned that the global temperature rise must be kept to 1.5C to protect hundreds of millions of people from harm. Another major recent report concluded that climate change is already a health emergency. Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, at the World Health Organization and also an IPCC report author, said doctors needed to press hard for climate action: “The health profession is the single most trusted profession in the world.” Just 0.5% of multilateral climate finance is currently going to healthcare, he said. Organizations representing more than five million doctors, nurses and public health professionals from 120 countries have issued a call to action to the climate summit in Poland. “We should no longer be talking about the cost of [cutting emissions], we should talk about the benefits to people’s health of investing in what needs to be done,” Campbell-Lendrum said. “At the moment we pretend that polluting [fossil] fuels are cheap fuels, only because we don’t include the cost of them to our health and economy.” The IMF estimates these subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to be $5tn a year, more than all governments currently spend on healthcare. Almost 200 nations are meeting in Katowice, Poland, for two weeks, aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into a reality, as well as increasing the ambition and speed of action and the funding needed. Current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming."
