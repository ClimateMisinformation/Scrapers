The sun drives the climate: Proof of the 90 and 200-year cycles in the earth’s climate history
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Solar activity fluctuates very much in cycles, among them the Gleissberg Cycle over 90 years, plus or minus 30 years. In March 2015 a study by Orgutsov et al. appeared in the journal Advances in Space Research which discovered the solar Gleissberg Cycle during the growth period of the northern hemisphere over the past 450 years. The authors suspected a solar impact on temperatures on plant growth. The abstract:
Evidence for the Gleissberg solar cycle at the high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere
Time evolution of growing season temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere was analyzed using both wavelet and Fourier approaches. A century-scale (60–140 year) cyclicity was found in the summer temperature reconstruction from the Taymir peninsula (∼72° N, ∼105° E) and other high-latitude (60–70° N) regions during the time interval AD 1576–1970. This periodicity is significant and consists of two oscillation modes, 60–70 year and 120–140 year variations. In the summer temperatures from the Yamal peninsula (∼70° N, ∼67° E) only a shorter-term (60–70 year) variation is present. A comparison of the secular variation in the Northern Hemisphere temperature proxies with the corresponding variations in sunspot numbers and the fluxes of cosmogenic 10Be in Greenland ice shows that a probable cause of this variability is the modulation of temperature by the century-scale solar cycle of Gleissberg. This is consistent with the results obtained previously for Northern Fennoscandia (67°–70° N, 19°–33° E). Thus, evidence for a connection between century-long variations in solar activity and climate was obtained for the entire boreal zone of the Northern Hemisphere.”
A year earlier Ogurtsov and a Finnish colleague had already published another paper on the Gleissberg cycles in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics. Back then they reported a solar Gleissberg Cycle in the nitrate concentrations in polar ice cores:
Evidence of the solar Gleissberg cycle in the nitrate concentration in polar ice
Two sets of nitrate (NO3−) concentration data, obtained from Central Greenland and East Antarctic (Dronning Maud Land) ice cores, were analyzed statistically. Distinct century-scale (50–150 yr) variability was revealed in both data sets during AD 1576–1990. It was found that century-type variation in Greenland and Antarctic nitrate correlates fairly significantly with the corresponding Gleissberg cycle: (a) in sunspot number over 1700–1970 AD; (b) in 10Be concentration in Central and South Greenland over 1576–1970 AD. Thus, presence of century-scale relationship between polar nitrate and solar activity was confirmed over the last 4 centuries. That proves that NO3− concentration in polar ice caps could serve as indicator of long-term solar variability.”

Another crucial solar cycle is the Suess-de Vries Cycle. In February 2015 Hans-Joachim Lüdecke together with his colleagues Weiss and Hempelmann published an overview of the climatic link of this solar cycle in the journal Climate of the Past Discussions:
Paleoclimate forcing by the solar De Vries/Suess cycle
A large number of investigations of paleoclimate have noted the influence of a ~ 200 year oscillation which has been related to the De Vries/Suess cycle of solar activity. As such studies were concerned mostly with local climate, we have used extensive northern hemispheric proxy data sets of Büntgen and of Christiansen/Ljungqvist together with a southern hemispheric tree-ring set, all with 1 year time resolution, to analyze the climate influence of the solar cycle. As there is increasing interest in temperature rise rates, as opposed to present absolute temperatures, we have analyzed temperature differences over 100 years to shed light on climate dynamics of at least the last 2500 years. Fourier- and Wavelet transforms as well as nonlinear optimization to sine functions show the dominance of the ∼ 200 year cycle. The sine wave character of the climate oscillations permits an approximate prediction of the near future climate.”
Also a paper by Tiwari und Rajesh published in May, 2014 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters is in full agreement with the above paper. In it the authors found the Suess-de Vries cycle in the precipitation distribution in Northwest China over the past 700 years:
Imprint of long-term solar signal in groundwater recharge fluctuation rates from Northwest China
Multiple spectral and statistical analyses of a 700 yearlong temporal record of groundwater recharge from the dry lands, Badain Jaran Desert (Inner Mongolia) of Northwest China reveal a stationary harmonic cycle at ~200 ± 20 years. Interestingly, the underlying periodicity in groundwater recharge fluctuations is similar to those of solar-induced climate cycle “Suess wiggles” and appears to be coherent with phases of the climate fluctuations and solar cycles. Matching periodicity of groundwater recharge rates and solar and climate cycles renders a strong impression that solar-induced climate signals may act as a critical amplifier for driving the underlying hydrographic cycle through the common coupling of long-term Sun-climate groundwater linkages.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline daily Die Welt here reports on how German consumers are being forced to pay huge sums of money to wind park and solar plant operators who are ordered to stop feeding electricity into the grid, but yet get paid anyway!
As volatile green electricity increasingly gets fed into an ever more unstable German power grid, wind parks and solar energy producers are being asked ever more frequently to switch off their plants to prevent grid overloads. Yet, they still receive money for the power they would have produced. It’s one of the nutty peculiarities of Germany’s wacky green energy feed-in act.
Die Welt calls this never-produced power “phantom electricity”. But it is costing consumers real cash.
One reason wind parks are unable to feed into the power grid at times is because the transmission lines needed to carry away the excess power are too inadequate to handle the frequent overloads, or they just don’t exist. Die Welt reports:
Because power lines are missing, wind parks have to be switched off more and more often. Yet wind entrepreneurs get paid for not producing. The costs for this are rising rapidly.”
Making money (and doing so with absolutely no risk) has never been easier!
Naturally this is causing electricity bills for German consumers to jump yet again. Die Welt reports that just the green electricity feed-in surcharge levied on consumers will reach “a record value of 6.35 cents per kilowatt-hour” next year. Now consumers will also have to pay even more money for power that never gets produced.
Already this year it is expected that a quarter billion euros will be added to electricity bills for the green kilowatt-hours which were never produced.”
This, Die Welt writes, is based on calculations by the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). The reason the estimated 1580 gigawatt-hours of electricity were never produced (but still paid for): “…because there was not enough powerline capacity to deliver the power to consumers.”

Consequently: green power producers and investors get off scot-free; consumers get the shaft.
The quarter-billion-euro amount is three times higher than the 82.6 million euros from a year earlier.
Die Welt reports that this warped market situation will only worsen in the future. As more volatile wind and solar energy come online, Germany tries to unload the excess power from it’s overloaded grid by dumping it into neighboring foreign markets such as in Poland or the Czech Republic, sometimes even at negative prices.
However these eastern neighbors are refusing to allow all the excess electricity to flood into their national grids unhindered. Die Welt reports: “Beginning next year Poland and the Czech Republic want to prevent German green power from coming into neighboring countries by employing power blockers at their borders, so-called phase shifters.”
So, on windy and sunny days, excess German green power will have no place to go, and thus this will necessitate the shutting down of even more wind parks and solar plants. That means the tab for the never-produced (phantom) electricity will continue it’s upward spiral. The result: even more money flooding up from the poor to the coffers of the rich.
No wonder the German model has become an export hit to countries with greedy green energy developers and investors! Making money has never been easier.
Die Welt summarizes:
Thus in the foreseeable future the German domestic power grid will be so massively loaded that there will be hardly any alternative to more frequent shutdowns of expensive wind and solar parks in Germany.”
That means more costs for consumers – for nothing in return.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOcala, FL (PRWEB) April 13, 2016 – Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) has issued the most accurate hurricane and El Niño predictions by any organization over the past 8 years, and was right on the money with the United States winter predictions and California drought the past 3 winters.
Photo: meteorologist David Dilley, GWO
With the El Niño transitioning to what is called “Neutral Conditions” and then to a weak La Niña by fall, the GWO says weather patterns will change rapidly during the summer and fall – bringing back weather patterns that caused active Atlantic Basin hurricane seasons from 2010 through 2012 – and a much harsher winter in some areas from the United States to parts of Europe and Asia.
An accurate prediction for the year that the California drought cycle will end is available on the GWO web site.
David Dilley, former NOAA meteorologist and now CEO of Global Weather Oscillations says – unlike the past three weak hurricane seasons that were suppressed by hostile atmospheric conditions and the 2015 El Niño – the next few years will be in a “Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle” that will provide very favorable conditions for development of Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes.
The Atlantic Basin Hurricane Season begins June 1 and averages 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2.5 major hurricanes. Last season (2015) was close to an average season with 12 named storms, 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes (includes Hurricane Alex that formed in mid-January). Typically the occurrence of an El Niño during a hurricane season suppresses the number of named storms significantly – but it did not significantly reduce the number of named storms last year, and this is a clear signal for what is in store the next few seasons.
Most dangerous, costly period in 10 years
Mr. Dilley says the combination of the relatively high number of named storms last year, and the El Niño transitioning toward a La Niña during the later portion of this season (2016), signals that a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle will be in place during the upcoming 2016 season and provide very favorable atmospheric conditions for hurricane development and landfalls during the next couple of years – with this likely being the most dangerous and costly period in over 10 years.

The 2016 season will have 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.
Three of the GWO United States prediction zones are at high risk for hurricane conditions in 2016, and one zone is at risk for a major impact hurricane. In addition – the 2017 season will be more dangerous and costly than 2016, with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and several of the GWO prediction zones will be at high risk for major impact hurricanes. Over the two year period, GWO expects 5 to 8 United States Hurricane Hot Spots.
Brutal US winter, drought in California
In addition to the change in the weather pattern that will be favorable for the upcoming active hurricane seasons, Mr. Dilley says the 2016-17 winter weather pattern will be dramatically different from last winter in many regions – with the upcoming winter pattern becoming more similar to the one that caused the cold Arctic Vortex outbreaks to plunge southward during the very cold 2014 and 2015 winters and a continuation of the California drought.
The very high Arctic Region that is a production center for cold Arctic air is already responding to the ending of the El Niño, and will likely experience colder than normal temperatures this summer – all of which will once again set the stage for very cold outbreaks in some regions from the United States to Europe and Asia. Detailed hurricane zone predictions, and more detailed regional winter predictions and 2-year Global El Niño and regional predictions can be acquired through the GWO web site.
The GWO researches and develops the “Climate Pulse Technology” (CPT). The CPT prediction model incorporates natural mechanisms that control the rhythm of weather and climate cycles, which in-turn control recurring California drought cycles, winter weather and future hurricane paths.
GWO’s research over the past 30 years has found that each of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal hurricane zones have different cycles, and within each cycle there exists smaller cycles – with each zone having their own unique cycle.  GWO’s so-called Hot Spot predictions for the United States have been nearly 87 percent accurate since 2006, and instrumental for long-range planning by companies and other organizations.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Sun in February 2016
By Frank Bosse und Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated/edited by P Gosselin
In February 2016 the sun was well below normal in activity, just as was the case for the previous several months. The observed sunspot number (SSN) was 57.2. The mean of previous cycles 1 to 23 for this month into the cycle is 80.8. This means last month of cycle no. 24 was only 71% of what is normal.

Figure 1: Solar cycle 24 activity so far (red) compared to the mean of cycles 1 to 23 (blue) and the similar solar cycle number 5 (black). 
A comparison of all 24 cycles follows:

Figure 2: Accumulated sunspot anomaly for each cycle, 87 months after starting. Each bar shows the accumulated monthly deviation from the mean. The current cycle is the weakest in almost two centuries, since solar cycle number 7.
In total solar activity for cycle number 24 has been a mere 57% of the mean with respect to the number of sunspots. It is very probable that the cycle will be among the 3 weakest since observations began in 1749 and end up in the same category as those occurring during the Dalton Minimum (c1790-1830, SC 5 to 7).
What can we anticipate after solar cycle number 24?

In our last solar report here noted that the first indication for the coming cycle is the strength of the sun’s magnetic polar field during the cycle activity minimum before the start of the cycle. There is still some time to go before we reach this activity minimum, yet we would like to take a glance at the polar fields. The data can be obtained here, and we computed them until the end of February 2016. Here we use the smoothed data (marked with “f”  for low-pass filter) because the unfiltered data are characterized by having too much short-term variation.

Figure 3: The smoothed data series of the sun’s polar magnetic fields: the mean value (black), the northern hemisphere (Nf, blue) and the inverted southern hemisphere (-Sf, red).
The polar fields oscillate phase-shifted with sunspot cycles: During the maximum the polar fields have a pole reversal (zero-pass) and vice versa. After the SSN maximum of 2013 especially the fields of the NH are growing significantly slower than the pole reversals measured since the mid 1970s. The SH (red in Fig. 3) is behaving completely normally and is pushing the mean (black in Fig. 3) upwards.
Next we look at the differences between the hemispheres:

Figure 4: The hemispheric differences of the sun’s polar fields. Positive values show stronger NH fields while negative values show stronger SH fields.
We recognize that different fields strengths are not unusual. Except for the polar reversal of SC24, which occurred in 2013, we note that over the entire cycle since 2008 fields in the SH were stronger than the NH and currently we have the largest difference between the fields since 1976.
A number of papers have looked into this phenomenon, e.g. Munoz-Jaramillo et al. (2013) and Ashish Goe et al. ( 2007). They connect asymmetry of the polar fields with a hemispheric decoupling of the solar dynamo. The latter paper also discusses the topic that a strong solar dynamo asymmetry was one of the reasons behind the Maunder Minimum (a phase of very low solar activity from 1645 to 1715).
It is at least worth looking into the varying differences of the sun’s polar field strengths. We will see what happens over the next 1 to 2 years as by then the fields will have reached the maximum and thus possibly make a forecast for the following solar cycle 25 quite robust.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFellow climate blogger Robin Pittwood at the New Zealand-based Kiwi Thinker here brings us up-to-date on how the current 2011 – 2020 decade is doing temperature-wise.
Many readers are aware of a climate bet made with alarmists Rob Honeycutt and Mr. Know-it-all, Dana Nuccitelli. The skeptics bet the current decade would be cooler or the same as last decade – using the RSS and UAH satellite data, and not the made up surface stuff from NASA.
Robin’s latest calculations show that the current decade is (still) slightly cooler than the last one comprising 2001 – 2010.
Of course, as expected, the recent El Nino event closed the gap and will probably even push the current decade to be a bit warmer in the months ahead. The question that remains now is just how strong will the upcoming La Nina be? Will it be strong enough to send the global temperature downward over the next couple of years 2017 – 2019, similar to what we saw back in 2008?
Right now there are a number of indications that this is precisely what is going to happen.

Robin writes:
We’re still seeing the effect of the El Nino nudging the green line closer.  Whether the lines cross over, and for how long, is still uncertain.  The El Nino indicators seem to have peaked and are beginning to decline, but as Bob Tisdale described at his blog, ‘Every El Nino is different’.”
So it looks like we are in a very close race, something that according to the alarmists was not supposed to happen. By now this decade was supposed to be a lot warmer. By the end of the decade it’s supposed to be some 0.2°C or 0.3°C warmer.
So even if the warmists did manage to eke out a victory by a few hundredths of a degree, it would be a very hollow one indeed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m short on time today, and so I’m reposting the latest on current El Nino – by German skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung here.
======================================
For the first time in over two months the Southern Oscillation Index SOI rose 4.6 points and thus points to a possible normalization of the atmospheric pressure relationship and thus an eastward tradewind over the equatorial Pacific.
This indicates a development I mentioned a few days ago: El Niño Update November 2015: Peak Already Reached?
…The index for the difference of the surface atmospheric pressure between Darwin (Australia) and Tahiti (island located at the Pacific equator) in October 2015 was -21.3  (previous month -16.7) as a 30-day moving SOI, i.e. clearly well into El Niño range of below -7. http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/#tabs=SOI 
The SOI is considered to be the two-month lead indicator for the development of the easterly trade winds at the equatorial Pacific and thus for future ENSO development.
At the end of October 2015 the SOI was clearly up after two low points in August:

Moving 30-day SOI from the Australian Weather Office BOM, end October 2015, with a steep drop in June 2015 and a low point in August and a jump upwards in October. Has the SOI reached its low point…? Source: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso
Only should this development continue can a weakening of the positive ENSO conditions be expected as a consequence…”
This development indeed is continuing for the time being as the latest SOI chart shows a steep climb in the still very negative values in November 2015:

During the past two weeks the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) has remained strongly negative, but has risen toward more moderate-strong values compared to two weeks ago. The 30-day SOI value to 8 November was −15.6.Sustained positive values of the SOI above +7 typically indicate La Niña, while sustained negative values below −7 typically indicate El Niño. Values of between about +7 and −7 generally indicate neutral conditions. Source:  http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/
On 10 November the value of the 30-day moving SOI is -13.96, and thus has risen even further. Latest Southern Oscillation Index values (Long Paddock)
The El Niño range is departed when the value of -0.8 is exceeded.

The once high hyped canary-in-the-coal mine Arctic is just not getting much attention this year from the alarmists this year – because it is doing the very opposite of what they predicted! 
The German skeptic site writes (translated/edited by P Gosselin):
==================================
With an ice extent of 8 million square kilometers at the start of November, the Arctic has reached the highest sea ice extent of the last eleven years. A chart from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) clearly shows the highest extent for sea ice cover with 30% or more ice on 7 November 2015:
(Click to enlarge)

This chart comes as no surprise for those who have been monitoring the weather and ice developments in the North Atlantic and Greenland.
You’ll find the latest on this at: “Global Warming” Reality Check October 2015 – global cooling since 1998 continues: RSS 0.44
“…The net growth of the Greenland ice sheet, which surely is a surprise for many, saw an increase in October of approximately 200 km³ (200 billion cubic meters) since September 1, 2015, i.e. in just 2 months:
The gross mass balance of Greenland’s ice shows a growth of 20o cubic kilometers just since September 1 2015 (blue line in the lower chart). The brown line in the lower chart ends on the right side at 31 August 2015 and shows a gross ice mass growth of approximately 230 km³. Source: same as above
Also take a look at the: Surprising NASA study: The Antarctic ice sheet is growing! IPCC 2013 report is wrong!
Moreover snow coverage of the northern hemisphere is telling us the same story. In October 2015, at 21.4 million square kilometers, it was the fourth greatest extent since measurements began in 1967, and is 4 million km² above the international WMO 1981-2010 mean:
Northern hemisphere snow and ice coverage in Octoaber 2015 is close to 4 million square kilometers above the WMO 1981-2010 mean, placing it at no. 4 since recordkeeping began in 1967.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German FOCUS here reports that the climate conferences and overall movement have turned more into hysteria and increasingly are becoming remote of fact. Good to see that the German media is finally backing off from all the hysteria and lending a bit of coverage to more moderate, non-hysterical voices.
Tol: “Very limited impact”
FOCUS writes that “some leading scientists are calling for sense instead of hysteria“, quoting renowned Dutch economist Richard Tol: “During the entire 21st century climate change will likely have only a very limited impact on the economy and human prosperity.”
Risk sacrificing prosperity for a huge “wind turbine graveyard”
Another skeptic voice that has become alarmed over the hysterical claims being made by scientists and activists is conservative top politician Arnold Vaatz, who cautions against placing too much emphasis only on projections from computer models. Vaatz, a trained mathematician, warns that if the models are refuted by observations, we could wind up with a “climate panic-driven overhaul of our society that will be a deadly false path for our economy and prove to be the highpoint in the waste of resources.” Vaatz adds:
Do our citizens really want to sacrifice their good standard of living for a wind park graveyard in Germany?“
Sahara greening “absolutely positive trend”
Another increasingly skeptical voice presented by FOCUS is that of geo-archeologist Stefan Kröpelin of the University of Cologne, a veteran researcher of the Saharan climate history. He reminds that the recent climate change has been a blessing for the Sahara, which has seen a greening due to more precipitation: “For many millions of people it is an absolutely positive trend.”
FOCUS adds that “studies and long-term observations also show that many many horror scenarios are unfounded.”
The German news weekly writes that Richard Tol analyzed a number of studies and concluded that a global warming of 1.7°C would produce “net advantages for man and the earth’s ecosystem.”

Another leading politician who is becoming increasingly doubtful of the climate hysteria is Peter Ramsauer (CSU) who says the massive and ideologically driven spending of billions and billions to reduce CO2 “is beyond every political and economic reason“. FOCUS quotes Ramsauer:  “We need a climate policy with sense instead of one with green ideology!“
FOCUS adds:
For experts like Ramsauer, climate policy has gotten totally out of hand.”
Potsdam science “on shaky ground”
Increasingly more and more German politicians are growing dissastisfied with the wild doom & gloom scenarios put out by the infamously alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), directed by Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber. But also German scientists are becoming aggravated by the inflated horror scanrios churned out by the PIK scientists. FOCUS reports that according to geoarcheologist Kröpelin “some of the ‘horror scenarios of the Potsdam scientists’ are already on shaky ground“.
Kröpelin tells FOCUS:
I often wish for more scientific self-imposed skepticism instead of dogmatism.”
FOCUS adds that CO2 is being unfairly singled out as only a climate-killing gas and reminds us, citing Hans-Joachim Weigel, Director of the Johann Heinrich von Thünen-Institute for Biodiversity, that it’s an “essential building block of photosynthesis and thus the basis for all life“.
The FOCUS slap-down of climate hysteria is just the latest of a series of recent articles by leading German media outlets expressing criticism of the spate of wild horror scenarios that have been uncritically released to the public recently.
Hopefully the media will continue bringing us such sober reporting regularly in the future. All the scare-mongering and doomsday scenarios have been a serious disservice to the field of science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore people and more wealth, yet less losses. That’s what the latest 2014 disaster statistics tell us. Bad news for the doomsday worshippers and cheerleaders.
The Geneva-Switzerland based International Federation of the Red Cross recently released its 2014 Natural Disaster Report, according to the German online daily BILD here. If anything, the news is very good – with huge drops in losses.
Moreover US hurricane and tornado activity trends since 1950 have remained flat or are decreasing respectively.
A copy of the report’s results is here. The AON Executive Summary writes (my emphasis):
Down Again: 2014 Catastrophe Losses Below Average
Global natural disasters1 in 2014 combined to cause economic losses of USD 132 billion, 37 percent below the ten-year average of USD211 billion. The losses were attributed to 258 separate events, compared to the ten-year average of 260. The disasters caused insured losses of USD39 billion, 38 percent below the ten-year average of USD63 billion and was the lowest insured loss total since 2009. This was the second consecutive year with below normal catastrophe losses. Notable events during the year included major flooding in India, Pakistan, China, and Southeast Europe; billion-dollar convective thunderstorm events in the United States, France, and Germany; winter storms in Japan and the United States; and widespread drought in the United States and Brazil. The top three perils, flood, tropical cyclone, and severe weather, combined for 72 percent of all economic losses in 2014. Despite 75 percent of catastrophe losses occurring outside of the United States, it still accounted for 53 percent of global insured losses, driven by a higher insurance penetration.”
According to the Red Cross data, many of the deaths were due to cold, with 505 alone occurring in one country – Peru! Among the top disasters were brutal winters in the USA and japan – hardly what one would expect from “global warming”.
90% less deaths
A total of 8186 people died in 2014 because of natural disasters. Bild reports: “2014 the number of deaths from natural disasters was almost 90 percent under the 10-year average of 76 500 deaths.” That’s hugely good news, but you’d never know it hearing the media!
Lowest in 10 years
According to the IFRC, in 94 countries there were a total of 317 floods, earthquakes, forest fires, cyclones and a number of other nature events with deaths. “But that was the lowest number in 10 years.“, BILD reports.
But the IFRC report insists that the news is bad no matter what, and warns that the good news won’t last, citing more severe weather events in the future (no date given) because of global climate change.
No Cat 3 hurricane landfall in 9 years
But data show the opposite. For example when it comes to hurricanes, the AON report writes on page 12:
The 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season marked the ninth consecutive year in which the U.S. did not sustain a major Category 3+ landfalling hurricane, which extends the alltime record by another year. It was also the quietest season in terms of named storms since 1997.”
It’s stunning that some are actually out there screaming things are worse than ever when the opposite is the truth.

On U.S. tornado activity it’s more of the same, with the AON report stating on page 17:
For the third consecutive year, tornado season in the United States was one of the least active since Doppler radar began being deployed in the early 1990s.”
Here’s the chart of the last 10 years – no change:

Also on page 18 the chart on acres burned by wildfire shows that 2014 was near a decade low:
The Appendix of the AON report also provides more charts on hurricane and tornado trends since 1950. What follows is a chart showing United States hurricane landfalls:

No trends in hurricane landfalls. Source: NOAA IBTrACS historical tropical cyclone database.
Violent tornadoes on the decrease
On violent tornadoes, the AON report writes:

Since 1950, the overall trend of higher-end tornadoes rated at F3/EF3 and above has remained nearly flat and shows a slight annual decrease of 0.8 percent. A comparable 1.2 percent annual decrease is also found when looking at dependable data since the advent of Doppler radar in 1990. When breaking down data to just the last 10 years, there has been a similar nearly flat growth at 0.5 percent.”

Here’s the chart:

Here we can see that violent tornadoes were considerably more frequent from 1950 – 1975 – back in the days of ice age warnings!
So the next time some hysterical alarmists insist weather extremes are getting worse, send the link to the AON report and tell them to look at the data for once.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAngry mobs of leftists attacking Donald Trump rallies and the US Justice Department threatening to criminalize climate science dissent are just the latest undeniable, very clear signs the entrenched Establishment is in all out panic mode.
If anything is certain, it is that they’ve lost the argument, and violence seems to be their last resort.
AP photo here: “DON’T TELL US HOW TO DRESS. TELL THEM NOT TO RAPE”. We could also say: “Don’t tell us what to say, tell them not to attack”.
Reports indicate that Moveon.org was behind the Chicago attack. Yet many of us know that there are others who are very nervous about the Trump phenomenon. The Republican Establishment hates him because they see themselves losing control of the Party and becoming irrelevant (they already are).
But what’s more telling are the attacks that are coming from the Far Left, such as the one organized in Chicago. Why would they want to destroy a candidate that everyone keeps telling us has no chance at defeating Hillary Clinton? The answer is that the opposite is true. The Democrats are in fact extremely terrified of Trump, and they have more than just an inkling that the flamboyant billionaire will likely beat the pants off Hillary. Indeed Trump’s appeal has spread into the Democrat working class base.
Blame the victim for rape

Also what’s been interesting is the reaction to the mob attacks from Trump’s other adversaries. Though the motivations behind the reactions are different, they all agree that it is Donald Trump himself who is responsible, at least in part, for the mob attacks. They tell us that Trump’s tone provokes violence. This has come from people you’d least expect it, like Ted Cruz. It is a disappointment that this constitutional expert would side with an angry mob and not stand up for free speech.
It is clear that Cruz and other Republican candidates have grown frustrated and desperate. Claims that Trump is responsible are really no different from those claiming the rape victim is at fault because she looked attractive. It’s a pathetic argumentation that won’t convince anyone with an IQ over 40.
If Trump’s positions on important issues are so off the wall, then it should be an easy task to take them apart in a civil debate. But this hasn’t been possible. Could it be that his message is one that bears too much inconvenient truth?
Criminalizing climate science dissent
Another sign the Establishment is in deep trouble is the recent effort by Justice Department head Loretta Lynch to criminalize scientific dissent in climate science. This one effort is so primitive and Medieval that it can only backfire. What kind of society do we live in when dissent on issues like climate change needs to be shut down with force and dissenters investigated and possibly prosecuted by the FBI? When things are that out of control and corrupt, then we ought not wonder when Donald Trump types take off.
I’m no fan of Donald Trump and I am very nervous about some of his positions. But after the latest attacks, I find myself warming to him, and cooling on Cruz. The precious right to free speech is clearly at stake and Trump is the one at the front lines taking the arrows. People now more than ever must not be afraid to stand up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Suppression of Natural Cycles Research by Universities – Is It To Protect Grant Money? 
By David Dilley
Former NOAA meteorologist,
(Now CEO of www.globalweatheroscillations.com)
On August 26, 2015, NoTricksZone published the article: “Gross Suppression of Science…Former NOAA Meteorologist Says Employees Not to Talk About Natural Cycles” where in it I wrote how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned employees not to put forth alternative views on climate science.
Also in the article I described an incident in which the University of Maine was instrumental in canceling my scheduled Climate Change lecture – simply because they felt “some people in the audience may feel uncomfortable” hearing about natural cycles.
Some readers were aghast by this article and reluctant to believe that a university could be so bold to actually shut down a guest lecture at another institution, and thus infringe on the open academic exchange of ideas, which is so vital for the progress of science. But whenever articles are based on real observations and facts, more meteorologists and climate researchers come forward and share related information and experiences.
Dr. William Gray, Colorado State University
Was the shutting down of my Natural Climate Cycle lecture by the University of Maine an isolated incident or was it a common tactic used to avoid retaliation by the funding sources and thus ensure the flow of future grants? To shed light on this Dr. William Gray, Emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University (CSU) and head of the Tropical Meteorology Project, provided his insights to me in a recent conversation. Dr. Gray recalled how he and Dr. Fred Singer “had experienced a somewhat similar situation with a scheduled climate talk at the University of Colorado, a university that receives generous amounts of grants for studies on anthropogenic climate change.”
Just as was the case with my scheduled lecture at the University of Maine, his lecture too had been advertised and a room assigned. But then, just prior to the lecture, Dr. Gray was informed that the room was “no longer available”. Dr. Gray asked for another room – and requested the room to be unlocked 30 minutes prior to the lecture so they could set up and that the university provide video equipment. They seemingly accommodated his requests. But upon arriving at the room a half hour prior to the lecture, he found that it was much smaller than the other room and that it was locked. They waited and waited, then finally at the very minute the lecture was scheduled to begin, the university unlocked the door. No video equipment was available. Was my lecture and Dr. Gray’s both shut down by the universities in order to protect the flow of grants? Is this now becoming common practice to suppress the freedom of speech, the open exchange of ideas and the science of natural climate change cycles?

Fritz Vahrenholt, University of Osnabrück
The same type of academic suppression also happened involving S. Fred Singer and Prof. Claes Johnson at an engineering and scientific society in Belgium (in this particular case the suppression stemming from a high level IPCC official) and with German professor Fritz Vahrenholt at the University of Osnabrück, just after the release of his climate science skeptical book “Die kalte Sonne”. The list is surely a long one, and many other professors and speakers can confirm the practice, or even far worse, with their own experiences.
Selling Integrity In Exchange For Grant Money? 
In 2008 I had a very candid conversation with Dr. Reid Bryson, who passed away in 2009 and is considered the “Father of Climatology”, and just this past week with Dr. Gray. Both professors put forth similar information on the acquisition of grants and both indicated this is how all university programs work. They told me, “Most university research departments rely heavily on government and private grants to survive.” According to Dr. Gray university research departments must play ball and “play by the rules” instituted by the grant system in order to secure climate grants. Playing by the rules means grant money for anthropogenic climate change is fairly easy to acquire, and all you have to do is apply for the advertised grant and deliver what the grant is requesting – which is to tie your research to human induced global warming.
Both Drs. Gray and Bryson indicated that “almost no grant money” is available for non-anthropogenic climate research. They also went on to say: “If you are a tenured professor, you must play by the rules and get published in journals to survive in the department. If you are not tenured, you definitely must play by the anthropogenic grant rules, or else tenure is a dream that will never be met”.
This is how the young researchers are kept in line by universities, and essentially sell their integrity in exchange for anthropogenic global warming grants. As a result of this biased grant system, there is very little research on natural cycles coming out of the universities. Most natural cycle research is either now being conducted by private companies that are not tied to the grant system, or by retired researchers who no longer need to worry about playing the game. So yes, the manipulation by the Universities of Maine and Colorado, and elsewhere, to shut down research and discussion lectures on natural climate cycles are not an uncommon practice and are aimed at protecting and maintaining the inflow of anthropogenic grants and agendas.
======================
Note: Not only is suppression of science a problem at the academic level, but there’s strong evidence of this at scientific institutions such as the NOAA. Anyone with more information regarding an NOAA “Talking Points” memo of the late 1990s instructing employees not to promote alternative views on climate science, please contact Mr. Dilley dilley@globalweatheroscillations.com. More on this later.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago the online Washington Post here had an excellent feature story by Peter Whorisky on the long-held belief that food products rich in saturated fats, like whole milk, were a risk to human health. It turns out that this decades-long belief, once backed by a “overwhelming consensus” among scientists, is now appearing to have been mortally wrong.
Science lied, people died
Unfortunately it took the science decades to realize it and government agencies responsible for issuing dietary guidelines still aren’t yet prepared to move to revamp the dietary guidelines as necessary. Meanwhile tens of millions worldwide have died prematurely of protracted, horrible deaths stemming from them following the faulty nutritional guidelines.
Five decades long nutritional scientists, every medical institution, among them the American Heart Association and the Academy of Sciences, all touted the high carb, low-fat diet. And five decades long they were wrong. It took a global epidemic of diabetes and heart disease to get the message across. And finally the media are catching up – though grudgingly: Whorisky pretty much keeps the focus on whole milk only, and away from meat, eggs and other healthy foods we have been told not to eat.
The WaPo writes:
Scientists who tallied diet and health records for several thousand patients over ten years found, for example, that contrary to the government advice, people who consumed more milk fat had lower incidence of heart disease.”
Why the focus only on milk? Why not on meat, eggs, bacon and other sources rich in animal fat? If your are going to admit you were wrong, then do it slowly and hope it doesn’t blow up.
The new medical and nutritional findings are not only a huge embarrassment for the government and medical institutions, but may also be a huge dilemma for the media’s much beloved environmental movement, which long has been touting granola-munching diets as a sustainable way to nourish humans. A renewed shift to animal products is not exactly the direction the planet-saving vegans and environmentalists want us to be on.
According to Marcia Otto, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas:
 What we have learned over the last decade is that certain foods that are high in fat seem to be beneficial.”
Whorisky writes that government bureaucrats are now unsure about how to proceed with revising its dietary recommendations. Suddenly and profoundly changing the long-held guidelines likely is not going to go over well with a public that already distrusts government and could even possibly open the government to lawsuits. At any rate it would be a major blow to credibility.

An interesting aspect of Whorisky’s piece is that the media and governments make it sound like all of this is new stuff. It is not. Decades-long a poorly funded minority of experts insisted that the nutritional science behind the lipid hypothesis had been weak and even faulty, and should never be made into dietary guidelines. But these skeptics were defunded, ridiculed and silenced; their science never saw the light of day. It turns out these skeptics had been right all along.
“Fragile hypothesis” becomes “treatment dogma”
Whorisky brings up the 7-country chart by Ancel Keys, regarded as the scientific foundation of the high-carb/low-fat theory, and makes it sound as if the chart originally was valid and that data from other countries came later on. That was not the case. The truth is that Keys had all the data from the other countries from the get-go but chose not to plot them because doing so would have shown that his beloved fat-theory was rubbish – there was in fact no trend showing that heart disease was related to fat intake. Keyes intentionally cherry-picked, cheated and deceived the public by using only the data points that produced a hockey stick.
From then on his theory morphed into a dogma that would go on to survive almost 6 decades. Unfortunately millions of people would die prematurely because of the guidelines later adopted as a result.
Whorisky writes:
‘The vibrant certainty of scientists claiming to be authorities on these matters is disturbing,’ George V. Mann, a biochemist at Vanderbilt’s medical school wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. Ambitious scientists and food companies, he said, had “transformed [a] fragile hypothesis into treatment dogma.”
Indeed, the subsequent 40 years of science have proven that, if nothing else, the warning against saturated fats was simplistic.
Although Whorisky tunneled his focus on milk and did not accurately present the work of Ancel Keys and the dissidents who opposed him, his piece is one that was overdue and it represents a major step in getting the government and medical associations to admit that they screwed up massively. In hindsight the affair is turning out to be nutritional malpractice of the most egregious sort.
Incredibly, perhaps with the aim of protecting the interests of its many member cardiologists and other physicians, the American Heart Association still stands behind the junk-science based lipid hypothesis and continues to deny the fact that fat is vital for human health and that refined carbohydrates have been the true American dietary disaster.
Climate science is even worse than “fat” science
The same type of junk science is now occurring with a carbon of another form: atmospheric CO2. Here a new breed of junk scientists are hysterically maintaining that CO2 will cause the earth’s climate system to have a heart attack. Here the science backing up that theory is even worse than that of Ancel Keys.

The cold is also expected to sweep across Europe by early this week. Spring is nowhere in sight and people are growing weary of winter.
The Daily Mail here reports that temperatures in Scotland fell to as low as -14°C this morning, the lowest recording in Britain in four years. Temperatures expected to fall to -15°C later in the week.
Taipei coldest temperature in 44 years
Unusual cold has also gripped Southeast Asia, especially Taiwan. German Bild here reports of “85 deaths in record cold in East Asia“. The German online daily writes that the temperature fell to just 4°C in the capital city of Taipei Sunday morning. Southeast Asia has been gripped by severe cold over weeks.
Heaviest snowfall in 32 years
According to the weather service it was the lowest reading in 44 years. Bild also reports that over 80,000 visitors were stranded on the southern resort island of Jeju due to the “heaviest snowfall in 32 years“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve reported earlier on Germany’s BARD 1 offshore engineering fiasco, where technical problems continue plaguing the wind park and has yet to deliver power on shore to reach markets. Even today the situation there remains unclear.
Moreover, just days I ago I reported how an expert institute confirmed that offshore wind park installations are highly vulnerable to the harsh sea conditions and plagued by stratospheric maintenance costs.
Well there is another major wind park that is now struggling with major technical problems and thus will not be able to deliver power until at least (optimistically) April. The giant offshore Riffgat wind park hasn’t delivered power since November of last year, so reports NDR German public broadcasting here. Hat-tip Gerti at FaceBook

Failed underwater power transmission cable

According to NDR, the power supply has been interrupted due to a failed underwater power transmission cable that serves to deliver the power onshore. That means a loss of 7 million euros per month in revenue, which the consumers will have to pay because Germany’s feed-in act required power companies to pay for the electricity produced by win parks even if it is never delivered. If that sounds strange, it is so because the market-hostile law is the sort of thing one would find only in old communist regimes.
The NDR clip reports that the reason for the failed cable is unclear, and could be caused by an error during installation or during the production itself. The cable fault itself is 22 kilometers from the wind park, just east of Borkum Island. Normally repairing the cable would be a routine matter, but there’s one big problem:  the seabed is riddled by old WWII munitions, which first need to be removed before repair works can start.
The Riffgat website here says the wind park consists of 30 units 3.6 megawatt-class wind turbines located some 15 kilometer away from the North Sea island of Borkum near the Netherlands. Each wind turbine has a 120 meter rotor diameter and the hub height is 90 meters. The turbines are firmly anchored by 70-meter steel bases rammed 40 meters into the seabed.
The Riffgat wind park also has a transformer station that feeds the power to the seabed transmission cable, which in turn delivers the converted power on shore. The Riffgat wind park is operated by Oldenburg-based power company EWE.
The NDR clip reports that EWE is not really too concerned about the technical problem and that it is not receiving 7 million euros worth of power each month. This is so because grid and transmission cable operator Tenet is required to pay EWE the money whether the power gets delivered or not. And where is Tenet going to get that kind of money? You guessed it! The costs, like everything else with the German Energiewende, just get passed on to the lowly consumers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt German climate and weather site wobleibtdieerderwaerumund.de here, author “Schneefan” writes about the Arctic stratosphere and potential polar vortices blasting into Europe before winter makes an exit.
He writes that models had calculated a warming of the stratosphere over parts of the Arctic, and this is now indeed taking place. And that warming has been strong and rapid. What does such an upper atmosphere warming mean? Schneefan writes it leads to a disturbed polar circulation, which leads us “to expect additional cold surprises over the earth’s northern hemisphere“.

Moreover at the upper stratosphere at about 30 km elevation (10 hPa) the rash warming has been interrupted, as the following chart depicts:

The interrupted upper stratosphere warming eventually led to the interruption working its way down to the lower stratosphere 18 km altitude (70 hPa) just a bit later:

This warming of the stratosphere over the Arctic leads to a negative Arctic Oscillation (AO), Schneefan writes, which in turn leads to polar vortices plowing down into the middle latitudes, as was the case in mid January, 2016.

Yet the prognosis for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) – contrary to the the (cold) values seen in January – remains slightly in the positive range, which would point to mild weather just ahead for Western and Central Europe:

However stratospheric prognoses point to a continued tendency toward a major warming/SSW) already in just a few days, which would mean that in 3 to 10 days colder weather for Western and Central Europe:

The cold polar vortex is positioned over eastern Greenland.  The cold pole of the northern hemisphere is over Scotland (C=Cold). The cold pole is set to shift over Europe. Source: www.geo.fu-berlin.de/met/ag/strat/produktehtml.
Such major warmings of the stratosphere last happened in 2012 and 2013 – in January, after which a very cold February followed in 2012, and an historically severe cold March gripped Europe in 2013 respectively.

Historic cold March of 2013. Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov/.
So, Schneefan writes, Europeans should not be writing off the winter just yet, as many meteorologists seem to have been doing over the past week or so. Weather is always a big bag filled with surprises. Things can go from mild to brutally cold awfully quickly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe web media have been reporting on how a group of activist attorneys general have recently launched efforts to clamp down on climate science dissent.
The science-dissent crackdown is spearheaded by 16 Democrat attorneys general and US Justice Department head Loretta Lynch, who is falling back in part on the powerful federal RICO (anti-racketeering) laws. Their aim is to go after those who allegedly are operating a “climate denial scheme”, alleging that the dissent is defrauding the public.
Just a days ago the Washington Times published an article here questioning the government “crackdown” on the skeptics of the alarmist government-sanctioned science amid the large growing body of science that now refutes alarmist science, all published over the past two years. Here the Washington Times cited NoTricksZone, thanks to the diligent work of guest author Kenneth Richard.
In the report the WT quoted meteorologist Anthony Watts, owner and operator of the world’s most viewed site on climate science, WhatsUpWithThat. Watts acknowledged the growing number of skeptical publications, and implied that the grounds for alarmism and consensus have become more disputed and shaky than ever. “There has been quite an uptick in papers that question the consensus this year,” Watts told the WT. He referred to the Virgin Islands investigation as “climate McCarthyism”.
The US-based Competitive Enterprise Institute libertarian think tank, a target of the investigation called the subpoena against it “the latest effort in an intimidation campaign to criminalize speech and research on the climate debate.”
The WT also cites Bloomberg columnist Megan McArdle who criticized the legal move against climate science dissent, noting that climate activists have an unfortunate tendency of “trying to brand dissenters as the equivalent of Holocaust deniers.”
Skeptics and non-skeptics alike accuse the attorneys general of spreading an atmosphere of intimidation, one that is totally foreign to free and open societies where the exchange of ideas is normally welcome and not met with hostility.
“Fraud” investigation may end up reversing
As of March 27, already 133 consensus-skeptical papers have already been published this year, bringing to 660 the number of such studies appearing since January 2014.

Guest writer Richard also recently communicated that his digging into the literature is now revealing that the climate activists had also deceived the public on another climate issue. He expects to present his findings within a few weeks and noted they may be “something really big”.
And as the newly published science surfaces, a clear picture is emerging. It is becoming clearer that the notion of a “consensus-backed settled science” is in fact an illusion and the scheme behind that illusion soon may need to be investigated itself.
Tide gauge measurements rising only 1.4 mm per year
Another illusion surrounds sea level rise. Recently this site presented a number of papers and data sources involving, real, observed tide gauge measurements which in fact show sea levels are rising at rates well less than half the claimed rates.
On the world’s 225 long-term tide gauges, according to Dave Burton of SeaLevel.info site here:
197 of 225 stations (87.6%) have recorded less than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. At 47 of 225 stations (20.9%) sea level is falling rather than rising. Just 28 of 225 stations (12.4%) have recorded more than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise.
The average SLR at those 225 gauges is +0.90 mm/yr. The median is +1.41 mm/yr.”
Strange how sea level rise “acceleration” happens to be absent along the coastlines, where it really matters.
There are many other instances, and it cannot be surprising that people have become skeptical. It’s time stop the investigation of the “fraud” of the honest, and to start investigating the “truth” of the dishonest.

Temperature records falling
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The global February temperature reported by GISS is 1.35°C above the 1951-1980 mean. That’s an impressive record and is 0.8°C (!) warmer than February 2014. How can such a huge jump in such a short time be explained? We presented one source last month: The Current El Niño.
But this time around we will focus on a huge area of ocean: the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP). It stretches from 90° east to 180° east, and from 20°south to 20°north, see shaded area below:

 Figure 5: The IPWP (shaded turquoise), Source: „Google Earth“
In this ocean region heated water of the tropical Pacific comes from Central and South America and is driven westwards by trade winds when normal conditions of the El Niño Southern Oscillation prevail (ENSO), or even under La Niña conditions. We have clearly explained this here. The highest sea surface temperatures occur here in the marked region shown in Figure 5 and is stable at approx. 28.5°C. The heat that originates from the entire tropical Pacific gets transported down to 500 m deep into the water. The temperatures down to these depths have behaved as follows since 2004:

Figure 6: The vertical temperature distribution of the IPWP (dbar= meters water depth). The chart was generated by Argo Global Marine Atlas.
Clear to see are: the smaller El Niños 2004/2005 (blue = cooler), the La Niña of 2008 providing for a warmer IPWP, the 2009/2010 El Niño providing for a short cooling, and the 2011-2012 La Niña bringing surface warming of the water once again.
Since 2014 we have seen a very pronounced cooling over the entire depth. For our consideration of the current global warming pulse, we limit our focus to the period after 2013.

Figure 7: The temperature curve of the IPWP down to 500 m depth (blue) since 2013 and the GISS global temperature (red) until December 2015. (Data source: GISS, Argo).
The mean temperature of the IPWP has fallen 1°C since spring 2013. The current temperature has never been this cool since ARGO measurements started in 2004. Here we are describing a water amount of approximately 16 million cubic KILOMETERS, taking the share of land into consideration in the IPWP! Here a quantity of energy is released that is equivalent to 4 days of sunshine over the entire planet. This energy increases the global surface temperature and leads to an increased outward radiation of a large part of the heat into outer space. Ultimately an El Niño results in heat being extracted from the Earth system.
This means that the warming that we are currently seeing is in fact a picture of this naturally occurring process which is now underway. The current record warmth has much more to do with the natural ENSO cycles than it does with the very modest global warming that is suspected to be about 0.01°C/year from greenhouse gases.

The loss stems from the writing down of the value of coal and gas power generation assets by billions of euros due to the steep drop in wholesale electricity prices. The write-offs were necessary in light of the dismal future the fossil industry faces. Plainly said: Germany’s Energiewende, transition to renewable energies, which mandates power companies buy up solar, wind and other green energies at exorbitant prices, and even when they are not needed, continues to rapidly erode the German base-power production.
Tens of thousands of once high-paying industrial jobs are now in serious jeopardy.
“Squeezed out” by massively subsidized green energy
With mandated green energies, the European power market is seeing a huge oversupply of power on the market that has wholesale prices far too low to cover generation costs.
Spiegel writes:
The company’s gas and coal power plants are hardly earning money due to the plummeted power exchange prices. Through the [massively subsidized] green energies, the conventional power plants are being squeezed out of the market throughout the branch. The price at the Leipzig EEX power exchange has halved over the past 4 years.”
Aren’t government subsidies and market meddling wonderful?

The hemorrhaging is far from over. Spiegel also reports that “E.on had a record 3.2 billion Euro loss in 2014“. Germany’s No. 2 power producer, RWE, is also reeling. Bloomberg here writes:
Germany’s shift to renewable energy is hurting utilities from EON to RWE AG as margins get squeezed at traditional coal and gas-fired plants because green power gets priority access to the grid. EON, the third-worst performer in Germany’s DAX stock index this year, is responding by spinning off its fossil-fuel plants into a separate company. RWE in 2013 had its first annual loss since 1949.”
Poor, working class getting hit hard
The tragedy of this mandated oversupply is that low wholesale prices, which at times are even negative, are not getting passed along to the consumers. Rather next year German consumers will see new record-high electricity prices. Already poor households are reeling and electricity is becoming a luxury for the affluent only.
The media reports that the Düsseldorf-based power producer will be spinning off its “entire power plant business” in the form of a new company called Uniper at the end of the year. It is reported that E.on itself will focus on “renewable energies and sales”.
It’s a real pity. Germany’s power companies used to be solid, high tech companies that delivered the most stable and efficient power in the world. Now they are literally being gutted alive before our very eyes. The country is setting itself up for some terrible times, and doing so fast.
Industrial base, social fabric in collpase
One could easily argue that Germany, under the leadership of Angela Merkel and her CDU government, is now witnessing an uncontrolled collapse as millions of refugees flood into the country, power prices spiral out of control, conventional power companies collapse, the industrial base moves abroad, and auto-giant VW faces a death by litigation and fanatic environmental standards. Expect volatile social conditions to spread soon unless sense returns.

At Twitter Dr. Ryan Maue writes that the data used at www.wunderground.com is “very wrong”. Dr. Maue even adds that ACE is in fact currently “nearing a peak b/c of El Nino  models.weatherbell.com/tropical.php“
Who’s right? Looks like Dr. Maue has the right figures and the ACE is peaking:

Note: The global 4-year ACE still remains near a 45-year low. 
=============================
Even though it is not true, alarmist sites everywhere continue citing “increased storm activity” as evidence of man-made climate change. Yet, when we look at the numbers, we see that nothing could be further from the truth.

At Twitter earlier today Philip Klotzbach tweeted, “Seasonal ACE only 50% of normal thru 9/9.”
Indeed looking at weather site www.wunderground.com we see that global cyclone activity measured by the “Accumulated Cyclone Energy” (ACE) index over the past four years is even at a 45-year low!

Global Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) since 1970. Chart shows that storm activity worldwide over the past 4 years is at a 45-year low and that the trend has been in steep decline since 1990. Source: www.wunderground.com.
Some years ago alarmist climate scientists, who insist a consensus backs their science, claimed with high certainty that global warming would increase the frequency and intensity of cyclones globally. We were told to expect “super-charged storms”, all fueled by global warming heat.
Well, something must be awfully wrong with their science. The exact opposite is true. The same has happened with temperature, global sea ice, and snow cover.
Perhaps the global warming experts will tell us that the huge cyclones are hidden somewhere deep in the oceans along with the “missing heat”, getting ready to pounce later in the future.

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In November our sun was once again below normal in activity. The 84th month since the current solar cycle started in December 2008 saw a solar sunspot number (SSN) of 63.2, which was 72% of what is the mean for month 84 into a cycle since observations began in 1755.

Figure 1: Our current solar cycle (SC) 24 (red) compared to the mean cycle (blue) of the previous 23 cycles. The current cycle over the past year or so as been very similar to solar cycle number 5 (black) which occurred from 1798 to 1810.
What follows is a comparison of all cycles:

Figure 2: The accumulated monthly deviations anomaly from the mean value (blue curve in Figure 1) for each cycle.
The current solar cycle 24 is weak compared to the previous cycles beginning with solar cycle 18 (1945). The books are practically closed for the current cycle as it is not expected to become more active and activity is expected to trail off. We are experiencing the weakest solar cycle since the Dalton Minimum 1790-1830, which involved solar cycles 5, 6 and 7.

What’s ahead?
For estimating the solar sunspot activity of the next upcoming cycle, observing the polar fields during times of activity minima provides strong indications. We reported on this here. So what can we expect some three years before the awaited minimum?

Figure 3: The polar fields of the sun since 1976. (Source: stanford.edu)
Early indications of a modestly active solar cycle 25
Especially the south polar field (show in red in Figure 3) is beginning to show signs of strengthening a little, yet is still behind the values of the very active cycles that occurred during the second half of the 20th century. This could be an indication that solar cycle number 25 may not be much weaker than the current cycle, but also not stronger. We will know more in about 3 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt have been busy mapping the Medieval Warm Period using Google as a tool.
Lately their focus has been on a number of studies examining temperature reconstructions from the Baffin Island and Western Greenland. This focus has been in part in response to a recent paper by Nicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which claimed with “great clarity of evidence” that the Medieval Warm Period did not exist globally and that it was a “patchy” phenomenon at best.
First Lüning finds that the paper’s emotional tone peculiar – one that seemed to be fishing for media attention at any price. Lüning notes, “One has to wonder that Columbia University would allow such an emotional and combative press release to go through.” Lüning and Vahrenholt added: “The paper also failed to get any attention from the German press. Did they sense that something could be rotten about it?”
Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s spent three weeks examining Young’s paper and many others from the region. Their conclusion: Young’s paper is ripe for the dustbin.
In all the two German scientists looked at more than two dozen papers from the region inquestion, covering some 20 locations, see plot below:

Figure 1: Chart of studies with results of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). The numbers refer to the sequence of the discussion in the text. Red points indicate MWP was warm, blue points show it was cold. See the interactive Google Maps map here.
Because time is short, I’ve translated only the summaries. All the abstracts of the more than 2 dozen papers presented are in English at Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s post, which I’ve linked to above.
Summary of results for Canada
In the North Canadian Arctic, the situation certainly appears to be clear: The MWP is described in numerous studies. Only 2 of 16 glacier studies (among them the one from (Young et al. 2015) show MWP glacier advances, which likely was a local phenomenon, e.g. caused by heavy local snowfall.
Lüning and Vahrenholt also looked at studies examining western Greenland, see following chart:

Figure 2: Chart of studies with results of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) – Close-up of Greenland’s west coast. The red markers indicate a warm MWP, the blue ones indicate it was cold. See the interactive Google Maps here.
In Western Greenland all studies show that the Medieval Warm Period was in fact warm. Moreover not only does Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s comprehensive Google Maps-based survey show that the Medieval Warm Period was real in the Arctic, but that it was clearly a global phenomenon as well.
Lüning and Vahrenholt summarize:
The detailed analysis of all the literature concerning the MWP in the Northeast Canadian Arctic as well as western Greenland shows that the claims made Young et al. 2015 are untenable. The MWP in the region is well-documented. Suddenly all these studies are supposed to be wrong? Young and his colleagues obviously failed to put the other local studies in the necessary regional context. Because of the failure to do so, they arrived at misleading and faulty conclusions, which they actively promoted to the broad public in a provocative and scientifically unbalanced press release. It remains unclear as to why the peer-reviewers of the journal Science Advances did not detect these deficiencies and did not request corrections. Will the many authors of the papers presented here discuss the results with Young et al. in order to resolve the deviating results, or do they risk being publicly ostracized as climate skeptical lobbyists? The scientific climate discussion is in a political choke hold. The Young et al. paper and its inappropriate alarmist marketing (“coup de grâce for the MWP”) is an example of the questionable and emotionally-charged condition of today’s climate research.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Bavarian Broadcasting, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), has a report on wind energy in the southeastern state that is famous for its Oktoberfest, dirndls and lederhosen. It appears the brakes have been effectively applied to the scenery pollution industry.

Eyesores no longer welcome in Germany. Photo: wind park in Lower Saxony, for illustration only, Philip May, CC BY-SA 3.0.
Bavaria is also home to some of the country’s most idyllic landscapes. But unfortunately Germany’s “Greens” have been pushing hard to industrialize this precious natural treasure – all with the aim of saving the planet. They have proposed the construction of dozens of wind parks of 200-meter tall turbines across the country side.
In the early days wind turbines were viewed as sort of a novelty and many communities even lobbied to get them. However, as wind parks sprouted across the country, people woke up to the natural destruction and overall inefficiency the wind energy has wreaked. Today, the BR report tells us that the tipping point has been reached: wind parks are no longer welcome; They’re too ugly, noisy, inefficient and only a very few profit from them at the expense of the many.
The BR report features one Bavarian village, Obbach, where a wind park with five 200-meter tall turbines was installed just 800 hundred meters away. Unfortunately for the village the park had been approved before Germany’s 10-H rule was enacted, and so construction went ahead much to the dissatisfaction of the village residents. The 10-H rule stipulates that no turbine may be closer to a living area than 10 times its height. Had the rule been enacted sooner, it would not have been possible to put up the park and the Obbach’s residents would have been spared the eyesore and noise.

Resident Andrea Lettowsky tells BR:
For me I keep thinking about how this used to be a beautiful landscape with open fields, and now it’s an industrial zone.”
That’s pretty much the sentiment that has spread across Germany, and with the 10-H rule Bavaria is leading the way in the country’s growing resistance to landscape spoilage by inefficient wind power. Already over 300 citizens initiatives have formed to resist the construction of new parks across the country. Moreover, recent reports tell us the German government is poised to scale back on renewable energies, aiming to cap it at 40 – 45% of total energy supply by 2025, according to the Berliner Zeitung.
The BR reports that although it is too late for Obbach, the new 10H rule is welcome and now gives communities the power to stop wind park projects that are aggressively pushed by deep-pocketed outside investors. Though it’s regrettable the park could not be stopped, Lettowsky is optimistic that other projects will be stopped elsewhere. The BR report concludes:
The fact is that the 10-H rule and the resistance from the citizens have pretty much put the brakes on further wind park construction in Bavaria.”
Indeed, thanks to forward looking states like Bavaria, the renewable energy tide is changing for the better.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBefore COP21 assembled in Paris last month, there was a sense of optimism that a new climate treaty to replace the long-expired 1997 Kyoto Protocol for reducing “greenhouse gas” emissions would be hammered out.
But now that COP 21 is approaching its scheduled end, we are finding out from the media that representatives are a long way from any effective CO2 reduction agreement. No one believes the COP21 summit is going to end tomorrow – rather expect it to drag out possibly into early next week, or even beyond. After all, when it’s about “saving the planet”, there’s no going home early.
The online German center-left DIE ZEIT here today describes a climate of growing chaos and diminishing order: “Almost every country has expressed reservations against the draft treaty at the climate summit.”
Among other countries DIE ZEIT blames Saudi Arabia, which threatens “to pull their support for the core goals of the treaty“, and India and Malaysia which are holding out for “greater commitments from rich countries“. According to DIE ZEIT there is neither agreement on financing for the poorest countries nor agreement on a limit in how much more the world should be permitted to warm.  DIE ZEIT writes:
The Saudi Arabian representatives have indicated that they do not want to accept any long-term target of limiting the warming to a maximum of 1.5°C.”
Another sticking point brought up by DIE ZEIT is the issue of whether to stop the burning of coal completely, or to just reduce it. On this point agreement seems unlikely given the number of coal-fired power plants now under construction and the hundreds more in planning. Developing countries may express their intention to some day stop coal in a new treaty, but they will certainly push the task off to future generations. It’s hard to imagine a number of struggling countries agreeing to forego the use of cheap and plentiful coal.
According to DIE ZEIT, environmental groups observing the negotiations and examining the latest draft are saying that the text in the treaty would lead “only to a weak reduction in greenhouse gases”.
So what is shaping up? Overall expect to see a treaty that will be very painful for rich industrial countries ($100bn per annum), but one that will be completely toothless against rising global CO2 emissions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you need more proof that climate change has taken on cult-like dimensions, then look no further than Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment (BMU), which delivers it in hardcopy in the form of a cookbook for climate-friendly eating.
Now people should eat in a way that makes the climate healthy and weather better – forget what is really healthy for our bodies! Many experts say the two are not the same.
Despite the latest nutritional studies showing the vast benefits of a diet rich in animal fat, the German BMU (which has no expertise on matters concerning human nutrition) is taking it upon itself to advise people to switch to a potentially ruinous fad diet with the highly dubious claim that it will positively impact the climate and weather in our favor.
Human dietary habits worse than auto, air traffic!
The BMU site writes:
Cooking for climate protection. Very simple and very necessary. The atmosphere is heating up from our dietary habits more than it is from automobile or air traffic. The best ingredients for culinary climate protection are: local organic food, less meat and dairy products – and seasonal fruits and vegetables instead of imported finished products. How this can be done in a tasty way is illustrated by the book with its 55 recipes and many vegetarian and vegan variants. There are also lots of information explaining how we impact the climate with our nutrition, and tips on sustainable grocery shopping. Cook and enjoy.”

Let’s be honest here. Some points have merit, like eating more vegetables, and less highly processed foods. However as mentioned above, recent- cleanly executed scientific studies are showing that meats and animal-based fats, like cheese and butter, are necessary for the healthy development of the human body, and have in fact been the cornerstone of the human diet for some 3 million years. The dietary advice now being promoted by the German BMU is a recipe for mal-nutrition and poorer health.
The timing of the WHO organization recently released report claiming processed meats are cancer-causing and putting them in the same category as tobacco and asbestos should not be wonder. The WHO report was immediately slammed and dismissed from all sides. The aim is to get humans to away from meat, and to switch to insects wit the hope of appeasing the climate gods.
Another interesting aspect is that the promotion of nutritional guidelines and dietary fads (this one put together by a gaggle of activists, no less), is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment, but rather instead that of the Germany Ministry Of Agriculture and Nutrition. The BMU is way out of bounds here.
Unfortunately, as is the case with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) the German Ministry Of Agriculture and Nutrition guidelines are outdated by decades as well, and are still promoting the notoriously dangerous high-carb, low-fat diet and continues to villianize foods like butter and eggs.
This is all cult gone amok.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy now we have all learned that wind and solar energy are highly volatile sources, and thus massively strain the power grids they get fed into once a certain scale is reached. This is now especially the case in Germany, a country that has, in an uncontrolled manner, aggressively installed wind and solar energy over the past decade.
Little wonder the German government stepped in and recently scaled back the subsidies.
But the recent government action has come too late. Yesterday Germany’s flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here posted a DPA news release on the mounting woes of the German Energiewende (transition to renewable energies). It begins with:
In 2015 grid operators had to intervene in the power grid like never before in order to prevent the lights in Germany from going out. The bill will be picked up by the consumer.”
During windy days, wind turbines often produce too much energy, energy that no one needs, and grid operators such as Tennet in turn force wind parks to close down to keep the grid from melting down. However, the grid operators still have to pay these shut down wind farms for the power that would have been produced. As more wind power comes online, wind park operators are forced to shut down more and more often, but with pay. The result – more costs for the grid operator. These costs from payments for unproduced electricity of course get passed along to the consumers. The FAZ writes:
The power consumers are going to feel this development over the coming year, as feed-in tariffs for green energy now make up 20% of the electricity bill.
The result? Costs from feed-in tariffs are expected to rise another 6% or more this year alone, the FAZ writes.
The German flagship daily also writes of numerous grid bottlenecks and unstable conditions, and grid operators are frequently forced to intervene to prevent blackouts – often temporarily shutting down regular power plants in an attempt to relieve overloads – thus making them unprofitable.
As more and more wind and solar energy are added on without any notion of planning, Germany’s power grid is now in dire need of massive revamping. Huge power transmission lines need to be built across the country in order to balance out the huge regional power overloads cause by volatile wind and sun. Not only is this going to take time, but it is also going to cost many billions more, the FAZ reports.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online French L’Express here reports how climate science skepticism is gaining momentum in France: “COP 21: the climate skeptics are heating up the Web.”
L’Express writes that the recent rise in French skepticism has been especially fuelled by former France 2 television meteorologist Philippe Verdier. who was sacked weeks ago by France 2 television for challenging global warming science and the “ultra–politicized the IPCC scientists (1)” in his recently released book. 
According to L’Express, Verdier has become a sort of a “martyr of freedom of expression” who echos the “Je suis Charlie” response in the wake of the radical Islamist terrorist attack on free speech newspaper Charlie Hebdo earlier this year.
Verdier is perceived as the latest high-profile newcomer to the French climate skepticism scene, following in the footsteps of renowned skeptic like Claude Allègre and Vincent Courtillot. 
The French daily writes that there has been more talk about Philippe Verdier in the French gazettes than there is of the regular climate scientists. L’Express describes the success of Verdier’s online petition for his reinstatement at France 2, which saw some 20,000 signatures.
L’Express sees climate skepticism as a sign of a re-awakening neo-liberalism and independent thinking, fueled by American think tanks like the Heartland or Marshall Institute, and now helped along by the newly minted French “comité d’organisation du Collectif des climatoréalistes” (Organizing Committee of the Committee for the Organization of the Collective of Climate Realists) started by Jean-Pierre Bardinet just weeks ago. 
It’s becoming clear that the skeptics, who have been dismissed repeatedly by mainstream media over the past two decades, have been a far more formidable force than the climate warming alarmists dare to admit. Frustration among the alarmists is reaching new high levels, and it is showing.
L’Express quotes Le Monde science journalist Stéphane Foucart, who recently opined on climate skeptics, who he writes are made up of “a small network of people who deny the reality of the current global warming or its anthropogenic origin“:
In 1979 in an editorial the New York Times predicted the dangers of global warming. It was still possible to take action. Today we are driving into a wall while honking. The climate skeptics have caused us to lose time we will never be able get back.”
Failure in Paris would indeed be a massive, unrecoverable blow to the warmist agenda, and would certainly be crippled if not totally disabled by it. Already the sharp tones tell us there’s a sense of worry spreading across the French capital.

===================================
The sun drives climate: 11-year cycles shown in natural climate archives
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Solar activity fluctuates in sync with a series of characteristic cycles. The most well-known of these is the 11-year Schwabe cycle. Naturally, 11 years are a relatively short time with respect to climate. Due to the inertia of the climate system, large climatic impacts cannot be expected from these short cycles. Yet it is still worthwhile to take a closer look. A series of appearing papers over the past years has looked into the Schwabe cycle and searched for a possible climate coupling in historical datasets. The search was fruitful: the solar Schwabe cycle has a measureable impact, and one that should not be underestimated.
We’d first like to start in Germany. Here a team of scientists led by Dominik Güttler of ETH Zürich studied 100-year old oak trees from the Medieval Warm Period in South Germany. Using C14 dating and counting tree rings, the scientists were able to find a clearly pulsating 11-year cycle. The paper appeared in January 2013 in the Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The abstract:
Evidence of 11-year solar cycles in tree rings from 1010 to 1110 AD – Progress on high precision AMS measurements
Oak tree rings from Southern Germany covering the AD 1010–1110 years have been analyzed for radiocarbon with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the laboratory at ETH Zurich. High-precision measurements with a precision down to 12 years radiocarbon age and a time resolution of 2 years aimed to identify modulations of the 14C concentration in tree ring samples caused by the 11 years solar cycles, a feature that so far is not visible in the IntCal calibration curve. Our results are in good agreement with the current calibration curve IntCal09. However, we observed an offset in radiocarbon age of 25–40 years towards older values. An evaluation of our sample preparation, that included variations of e.g.: chemicals, test glasses and processing steps did not explain this offset. The numerous measurements using the AMS-MICADAS system validated its suitability for high precision measurements with high repeatability.”
The next stop is Italy in the Ionian Sea. Researchers there as well found the 11-year solar cycle in the climate archives of the last 2700 years. The study was published in March 2015 in the journal Climate of the Past. The abstract:
A high-resolution δ18O record and Mediterranean climate variability
A high-resolution, well-dated foraminiferal δ18O record from a shallow-water core drilled from the Gallipoli Terrace in the Gulf of Taranto (Ionian Sea), previously measured over the last two millennia, has been extended to cover 707 BC–AD 1979. Spectral analysis of this series, performed using singular-spectrum analysis (SSA) and other classical and advanced methods, strengthens the results obtained analysing the shorter δ18O profile, detecting the same highly significant oscillations of about 600, 380, 170, 130 and 11 years, respectively explaining about 12, 7, 5, 2 and 2% of the time series total variance, plus a millennial trend (18% of the variance). The comparison with the results of multi-channel singular-spectrum analysis (MSSA) applied to a data set of 26 Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature-proxy records shows that NH temperature anomalies share with our local record a~long-term trend and a bicentennial (170-year period) cycle. These two variability modes, previously identified as temperature-driven, are the most powerful modes in the NH temperature data set. Both the long-term trends and the bicentennial oscillations, when reconstructed locally and hemispherically, show coherent phases. Furthermore, the corresponding local and hemispheric amplitudes are comparable if changes in the precipitation–evaporation balance of the Ionian sea, presumably associated with temperature changes, are taken into account.”
In April 2014 Liang Zhao and Jing-Song Wang of the Peking National Center for Space Weather reported in the Journal of Climate on another Schwabe finding. The authors studied fluctuations in the east Asian monsoons and here too were able to see a clear influence by the 11-year solar cycle. The abstract of the paper:
Robust Response of the East Asian Monsoon Rainband to Solar Variability
This study provides evidence of the robust response of the East Asian monsoon rainband to the 11-yr solar cycle and first identify the exact time period within the summer half-year (1958–2012) with the strongest correlation between the mean latitude of the rainband (MLRB) over China and the sunspot number (SSN). This period just corresponds to the climatological-mean East Asian mei-yu season, characterized by a large-scale quasi-zonal monsoon rainband (i.e., 22 May–13 July). Both the statistically significant correlation and the temporal coincidence indicate a robust response of the mei-yu rainband to solar variability during the last five solar cycles. During the high SSN years, the mei-yu MLRB lies 1.2° farther north, and the amplitude of its interannual variations increases when compared with low SSN years. The robust response of monsoon rainband to solar forcing is related to an anomalous general atmospheric pattern with an up–down seesaw and a north–south seesaw over East Asia.”

Two months ago a team of researchers led by Zhongfang Liu published a study on the North American winter climate in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Surprisingly the scientists found a strong impact by the 11-year solar cycle, which in part has an influence on the climate of the North American winter via the Pacific circulation system. Abstract:
Solar cycle modulation of the Pacific–North American teleconnection influence on North American winter climate
We investigate the role of the 11-year solar cycle in modulating the Pacific–North American (PNA) influence on North American winter climate. The PNA appears to play an important conduit between solar forcing and surface climate. The low solar (LS) activity may induce an atmospheric circulation pattern that resembles the positive phase of the PNA, resulting in a significant warming over northwestern North America and significant dry conditions in the Pacific Northwest, Canadian Prairies and the Ohio-Tennessee-lower Mississippi River Valley. The solar-induced changes in surface climate share more than 67% and 14% of spatial variances in the PNA-induced temperature and precipitation changes for 1950–2010 and 1901–2010 periods, respectively. These distinct solar signatures in North American climate may contribute to deconvolving modern and past continental-scale climate changes and improve our ability to interpret paleoclimate records in the region.”
In the conclusion they write:
Our results have shown the influence of the 11year solar cycle on the PNA associated atmospheric circulation pattern and winter surface climate in North America.”
Also in the Bering Sea a team of scientists showed the impacts of the solar Schwabe cycle. Kota Katsuki and his colleagues found the cycle in the climate archives of 13,000 years ago. That study appeared in April 2014 in the Geophysical Research Letters:
Response of the Bering Sea to 11-year solar irradiance cycles during the Bølling-Allerød
Previous studies find decadal climate variability possibly related to solar activity, although the details regarding the feedback with the ocean environment and ecosystem remain unknown. Here, we explore the feedback system of solar irradiance change during the Bølling-Allerød period, based on laminated sediments in the northern Bering Sea. During this period, well-ventilated water was restricted to the upper intermediate layer, and oxygen-poor lower intermediate water preserved the laminated sediment. An 11-year cycle of diatom and radiolarian flux peaks was identified from the laminated interval. Increased fresh meltwater input and early sea-ice retreat in spring under the solar irradiance maximum follow the positive phase of Arctic Oscillation which impacted the primary production and volume of upper intermediate water production in the following winter. Strength of this 11 year solar irradiance effect might be further regulated by the pressure patterns of Pacific decadal oscillation and/or El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability.”
Last but not least we have a classic paper on the Schwabe cycle by a group led by Hiroko Miyahara in 2009 appearing in the Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union:
Influence of the Schwabe/Hale solar cycles on climate change during the Maunder Minimum
We have examined the variation of carbon-14 content in annual tree rings, and investigated the transitions of the characteristics of the Schwabe/Hale (11-year/22-year) solar and cosmic-ray cycles during the last 1200 years, focusing mainly on the Maunder and Spoerer minima and the early Medieval Maximum Period. It has been revealed that the mean length of the Schwabe/Hale cycles changes associated with the centennial-scale variation of solar activity level. The mean length of Schwabe cycle had been ~14 years during the Maunder Minimum, while it was ~9 years during the early Medieval Maximum Period. We have also found that climate proxy record shows cyclic variations similar to stretching/shortening Schwabe/Hale solar cycles in time, suggesting that both Schwabe and Hale solar cycles are playing important role in climate change. In this paper, we review the nature of Schwabe and Hale cycles of solar activity and cosmic-ray flux during the Maunder Minimum and their possible influence on climate change. We suggest that the Hale cycle of cosmic rays are amplified during the grand solar minima and thus the influence of cosmic rays on climate change is prominently recognizable during such periods.”
===========================================
If the 11-year cycle already has an impact, then just imagine the profound impact that the other loner term cycles have, such as the 78-year cycle and the 1000-year solar cycle. These surely cement the climate into longer term phases. -PG

Angela Merkel’s policy of unhindered mass immigration is coming home to roost as her CDU party took a massive body blow in this Sunday’s state elections.
Also Germany’s other mainstream established parties have been dealt severe hits as voters went to the polls in three states: Saxony Anhalt, Baden Württemberg and Rhineland Palatinate.
Rise of the Right
The recently minted populist rightwing Alternativ für Deutschland (AfD) – Alternative for Germany- has risen into a major party that will certainly become a thorn in Germany’s consensus-oriented mainstream political landscape.
The AfD pulled in an astonishing 24% in the eastern state of Saxony Anahlt amid growing fears of an emerging right. They performed strongly elsewhere as voters ignored warnings not to vote for them.
The preliminary results and the change from 2011 are in:

Saxony Anhalt
CDU conservatives 29.7 % (lost 2.8%)
SPD socialists 10.2% (lost 11.3%)
Linke (leftists) 15.7.9% (lost 8.0%)
Grünen (greens) 5.0% (lost 2.1%)
FDP free democrats 3.8% (gained 1.2%)
AfD (rightwing) 24.0%
Baden Württemberg
CDU Conservatives 26.9% (lost 12.1%)
SPD socialists 12.8% (lost 10.3%)
Linke (leftists) 2.9% (gained 0.1%)
Grünen (greens) 30.5% (gained 6.2%)
FDP free democrats 8.4% (gained 3.1%)
AfD (rightwing) 14.9%
Rhineland Palatinate 
CDU Conservatives 32.0% (lost 3.2%)
SPD socialists 36.8% (gained 1.1%)
Linke (leftists) 3.0% (no change)
Grünen (greens) 5.2% (lost 10.3%)
FDP free democrats 6.2% (gained 2.0%)
AfD (rightwing) 11.7%
The numbers will be revised as the evening goes on.
Overall it’s clear that Germany’s mainstream parties took severe hits. In protest to the handling of immigration policy, a large chunk of voters opted for the AfD party. It’s unknown whether the AfD has any staying power. They’ve been under massive attack by the media and established politicians.
The FDP Free Democrats appear to have emerged from their near extinction, managing to squeak by the 5.0% threshold in all three states.
One thing is certain: Germans are demanding alternatives to the consensus-driven culture that has gripped the country since Angela Merkel has been in office as chancellor. Germans don’t mind immigration, and understand it is necessary. They just want it to be done right. Sound familiar?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a comment by a PhD (wishes to remain anonymous) on the subject of peer-review. I’ve decided to upgrade it to a post (some editing).
============================================
Peer Review Is Not Magic
By The indomitable Snowman PhD
I usually don’t comment. But I noticed that NTZ attracted a new troll, who is just taking talking points from the support group sites and regurgitating them.

Peer-review often serves to prop up dearly held dogma.
I just couldn’t let the so often cited “holy peer review” thing pass because it’s long been a mess. Since with publication on climate science, one is required to support the dogma, or the very least not dare to question it, or risk getting fired or having your funding pulled (same thing).
I would say the appropriate term is “FEAR review”.
It’s funny to see comments from alarmists and the links to the sites they provide. Those “sites” are very often not information sites, but support groups for zealots who need to believe and to go there to get belief-support and talking points – and who then leave their bubble and mindlessly regurgitate it all later.

The “peer review” thing is one of those babbling points. As Ed Begley (in)famously said, “Don’t take it from me folks – take it from people with a ‘Ph.D.’ after their name.” Peer review isn’t magic and has lots of problems, and I say this as someone who has had regular contact with peer review for more than two decades – as an author, reviewer, and editor.
Peer review serves only to provide some minimal quality control – screening out things like bad grammar, weak background work on references and prior art, etc. It’s also an iterative process – a paper is reviewed and the reviewers have comments/thoughts for the author(s), and the process iterates – it’s actually very unusual for any paper to be “outrighted” – either accepted as-is or simply rejected outright.
It’s funny seeing the inflated claims made (by no-doubt non-participants), since the system was never built to provide the claims of infallibility that the non-participants ascribe to it. Some problems with peer review:

It’s time consuming, and everyone is busy. Reviewers are volunteers, and usually they are short on time (like everyone) and a request for a prompt review is one more thing on the pile.  (The best place to do peer review is in the passenger compartment of a commercial aircraft.)  So peer review tends to be quite cursory, even when intentions are good.
Too many academics – and they too often treat manuscripts as being a student’s dissertation and continually demand more analysis and MORE analysis; it’s amazing how much useful material never gets into the journals simply because someone wants more and more and MORE analysis/measurements done to (in the reviewer’s view) nail down every last detail to the n-th degree.
The process can be abused with intent – and this is true in ALL fields. Peer review tends to stifle non-dogmatic thinking (and the more academic the field, the more this happens). This doesn’t even have to be malevolent – dogma can become so entrenched that anything that disagrees is instantly branded as incorrect; given the number of dogmatic points in a wide variety of fields that have turned out to be totally wrong, you’d think that there would be interest in reforming the process, but that hasn’t happened yet.  And, unfortunately, the process is regularly abused to suppress opposing views – or views/ideas that are merely “competitive” to the reviewer’s views (or “side”).

I’ve actually seen numerous instances where the same (as always, anonymous during the review process) reviewers who blocked a paper from being published then state publicly that those opposing ideas are obviously wrong because “they were unable to get through peer review.”
This general problem is finally getting some attention – along with other problems with the actual realities of “science.” There’s an excellent-and-timely article that came out this month that’s worth reading in detail, which discusses “peer review” and other issues that are undermining the quality and usefulness of “science.”
http://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/05/scientific-regress
Take the time to read that whole article; it’s lengthy but worth it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs expected, we are now finding out the Paris climate climate agreement has been spectacularly oversold to the public as a success for climate protection.
Now that the text has been examined, it is clear that the agreement, which cannot even be called a treaty, and which has yet to be “ratified”, is turning out to be an empty package of pompous proclamations, opt-outs and intents.
Global warming godfather James Hansen has even called the conference and its result a fraud. Economic expert Prof. Bjorn Lomborg wrote at Twitter that the agreement will be “extraordinarily costly“, and that it “will do little – if anything to rein in global warming.”
At his blog renowned climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer ridiculed the watered-down agreement, implying that it is a meaningless feel-good gesture.
Michael Limburg European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) wrote that the agreement is not even a treaty, reminding us that it was even forbidden by President Obama to call it a “treaty”. EIKE calls the agreement “a failure” and that it is not possible to control the climate with “declarations of intent” EIKE adds that “participation in all climate protection measures remain for the most part voluntary and that no sanctions were agreed on and that even the climate faithful have had to concede that this it is useless“.
Limburg writes that the only success of the agreement is: “The UN has taken an important step closer to reaching the target of transforming the current world order into one of a central planning system“.
Climate experts Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt write at Die kalte Sonne:

After years of fruitless climate conferences, the breakthrough supposedly has now been suddenly reached. But is it true? A closer look at the agreement document brings a surprise: Much remains optional, and financial commitments are kept limited. And that is good because the scientific basis of climate change is on very shaky ground on every front. It almost appears as if the media agree beforehand to report on this positively this time around in order to lend momentum to climate policymaking. A failure this time would have led the public to wonder.”
At the Handelsblatt here meteorologist Karsten Schwanke says “the climate agreement is a catastrophe!“
Indeed the targets come up much too short, weather expert Karsten Schwanke belives. At the current pace we are headed for 3.2 to 5.4°C of warming until the year 2100 – and with our emissions we are moving along close to the top of the upper range.”
Wanting to pile onto the voluntary requirement of 1.5°C – to say it mildly – is foreign to reality.”
Die Welt/Prof Mojib Latif
At the online flagship daily Die Welt, climatologist Mojib Latif is reported to be dissatisfied with agreement, and is quoted as saying the countries agreed on the “lowest common denominator” for climate protection.
With these targets the agreed global warming cannot be achieved.”
Die Welt notes that despite all the lofty rhetoric the world is not really taking the problem seriously, noting that “since the early 1990s global CO2 emissions have risen 60 percent“.

Over 171,000 alpacas have died from hypothermia, diarrhea, pneumonia and starvation. The animals feed on grass, which is frozen and covered in snow.
The German language Latina Presse here called the cold wave and the death a tragedy.
In 2013 Approximately 250,000 alpacas died “as a result of the worst snowfall” Peru had seen in a decade and the “unexpectedly intense blast of winter weather”. Read here.
The Nature World News wrote in 2013:
In Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, temperatures were 8 or 9 degrees Celsius below average, Al Jazeera reported, adding that the Atacama Desert in Chile, often regarded as one of the driest places on Earth, saw the heaviest snowfall the region has seen in 30 years.”
For a supposedly overheated planet, we sure have been seeing lots of reports of “unusual cold” coming from all over the world.

================================
After a globally warm October 2015 the unfalsified satellite data from UAH and RSS show that mid tropospheric temperature dropped significantly in the first 10 days of November: -0.5°K.
After reaching high levels in October the daily recorded global mean temperature at 7500 m for the year 2015 in the UAH chart has at times fallen below those the during the El Niño impacted years of 2014, 2010, 2009, 2005 and 2002 (click to enlarge):

The 2015 satellite measurements (lilac curve) at 7500 m altitude were at a high in October, yet during the first ten days of November (white box) temperature was clearly under the years 2014, 2010, 2009, 2005 and 2002: Source: AMSU-A Temperatures.

Also the daily recorded mean global 2m temperatures eased to +0,361°K after the October record value of +0.495°K deviation compared to the WMO climate mean, putting it so far only at 4th place for the month of November:

Analysis of global 2m temperatures show that November 1-10, 2015 had a deviation of 0.361 K compared to the commonly used modern WMO 1981-2010 climate mean. Source: http://models.weatherbell.com/temperature.php. 
While the ongoing powerful El Niño event that has been taking place since the summer of 2015 allows us to expect a further 5-month delayed global warming as seen in October, November so far is pointing to no record value with the satellite temperature measurements and with the 2m temperatures.
Of course we have to wait and see if it stays that way. See: ENSO Update: SOI-Tageswert erstmals seit zwei Monaten positiv – El Niño beginnt zu schwächeln… or here in English at NoTricksZone.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere really are many scientists who dispute the alarmist conclusions of the climate scientists.
What follows is a scathing open letter from Japanese scientist and modeling expert Kyoji Kimoto to Dr. Syukuro Manabe, Dr. James Hansen and Dr. Robert Cess.
======================================
You are the lawbreakers in the court of science
by Kyoji Kimoto
9 January, 2016
Dear Dr. Syukuro Manabe, Dr. James Hansen and Dr. Robert Cess,
The anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory of the IPCC is based on Manabe & Wetherald (1967) and Hansen et al., (1981) which utilize one dimensional radiative convective equilibrium model (1DRCM) with the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2, obtaining the zero feedback climate sensitivity of 1.2-1.3K.
However it is theoretically meaningless when the parameter sensitivity analysis is applied to the lapse rate for 2xCO2 as shown here.
Hansen himself admitted that 1DRCM is a fudge in an interview with Spencer Weart held on 23 October, 2000 at NASA as shown below. Here Dr. Hansen and his colleagues are referring to a paper by W. C. Wang et al., 1976: “Greenhouse Effects due to Man-Made Perturbations of Trace Gases” Science 194, 685-690.
An excerpt from the interview:
Weart:
This was a radiative convective model, so where’s the convective part come in. Again, are you using somebody else’s…
Hansen:
That’s trivial. You just put in…
Weart:
… a lapse rate…

Hansen:
Yes. So it’s a fudge. That’s why you have to have a 3-D model to do it properly. In the 1-D model, it’s just a fudge, and you can choose different lapse rates and you get somewhat different answers. So you try to pick something that has some physical justification. But the best justification is probably trying to put in the fundamental equations into a 3-D model.
See more: https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/24309-1
Cess made a mathematical error in Cess (1976), Cess et al., (1989) and Cess et al., (1990) when differentiating his equation OLR=EeffxsigmaxTs^4,which can be detected by any high school student learning differentiation. Manabe and the IPCC AR4 adopted Cess method to obtain the zero feedback climate sensitivity (Planck response) =1.2K. The detailed discussions are here: http://multi-science.atypon.com/doi/abs/10.1260/0958-305X.26.6-7.1055
The AGW theory of the IPCC has caused huge economic losses to the world, including the collapse of British coal industry and the Fukushima nuclear disaster from the nuclear promotion policy of Japanese government to cut CO2 emissions. How will you take your responsibility for this?
As shown above, you are lawbreakers in the court of science. In the farewell lecture held on 26 October, 2001 in Tokyo, Manabe spoke about his research as follows:
Research funds have been $3 million per year and $120 million for the past 40 years. It is not clever to pursue the scientific truth. A better way is choosing the relevant topics to society for the funds covering the staff and computer cost of the project.”
Sincerely,
Mr. K. Kimoto

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Christian Zenkl: Winter temperatures in the Alps region have fallen about 1°C over past 30 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On September 16, 2015; Gernan public broadcaster Bayerischen Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting, or BR) announced:
Farewell to white winters 
Light mist, no snow: It’s gotten warmer in Bavaria – and foremost in the winter and especially in the mountains. Already there is measureably less snow. Are our winters going to turn green? What does it all mean for the ski areas?”
But is this true? In the magazine GEO SAISON, 12/2015, Christian Zenkl, an independent meteorologist in Innsbruck, corrected the BR media error:
‘In the Alps region temperatures in the mountains have fallen about 1°C over the past 30 years. Because of the sunnier and warmer summers, the glaciers have lost mass and in total temperatures in the Alps have warmed. However winters have gotten somewhat colder. ‘There hasn’t been less snow,’ says Zenkl. To the contrary, there has been a positive trend starting at 1000 meters. Today from a strictly climatic view, snow-making cannons are not any more needed than they were 30 years ago.”
The expansion to 40,000 snow-making cannons is merely due to pure business reasons, e.g. extending the ski-season and competition between ski resorts. Data from the German DWD national weather service even confirm the winter season temperature cooling trend, even though you’ll never hear it from the DWD:

It turns out that earlier predictions by Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst DWD for a warm fall have been shattered so far, just the latest in a string of blunders we’ve been witnessing from the DWD.
The WBDGE site tells us:
After an already cool September, an historic cold wave with snow reaching into the flatland during the first half of October saw mean temperatures in parts of Germany clearly well below the 30-year mean as the following chart shows:”

Back in September Germany’s DWD Weather Service had forecast October in Germany to be “warm”. However so far the exact opposite has been the case. This is in part the result of the deeper than expected cold spell that just occurred.
How cold was it? Wetteronline.de here reports that some places saw all-time record lows for the date. The site writes:

On Wednesday winter started at what may be a record early date. At times a blanket of snow formed in the lowlands. At some locations it was colder than ever recorded since temperature records began.
On Wednesday new record low temperatures were set across a large region. In the west the thermometer showed high temperatures of only 5°C. At some locations, such as Cologne and Essen, it was the coldest since records began back in 1881. From Thuringia, across western Saxony, and down into northern Bavaria high temperatures reached only 1 – 3°C.
Björn Alexander blames 2015 cold on 2012 Arctic ice extent!
Comically the unexpected extreme cold had parts of the German media scrambling to explain it, blaming it all global warming. For example meteorologist Bjorn Alexander of German NTV public television site here said the cold was due to the widespread Arctic ice cap melt – of 2012! NTV tells its readers:
Why such cold days in times of climate change? As absurd as it may sound: Especially because of global warming Europe will see record breaking cold more often. That is increasingly so because of greater ice melt in the Arctic. Models show: The less sea ice there is in the Arctic, the more probable it is that a high forms up there and brings cold to Europe.”
The link he provides, however, takes the reader to the 2012 record low sea ice extent, and not this year’s sea ice extent – which is now close to a 10-year high for this time of the year. Alexander also seems to be unaware that the models he refers to were slapped together by red-faced PIK scientists after the cold winters began hitting Europe back in 2009. These models have since been dismissed by a number of scientists and meteorologists
Temperatures in Central Europe are expected to moderate in the days ahead. However, recent GFS models show that winter maybe returning by the end of the month. See here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only should we be concerned about the overall cooling that is now in the works for the globe, as we reported here, but for those of us in Central Europe we can now forget about getting out the sundry summer items for at least another week.
The frost on my car’s windshield yesterday morning here in the north German lowlands was a sign of what lies ahead.
Snow!
The forecast for Central Europe shows the month of April getting sharply colder, rather than warmer like it’s supposed to. The latest forecast even sees snow down in the north German flatlands next Monday.
At Weatherbell Analytics, the forecast snow was impressive enough for veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi to mention it yesterday in his daily weather video. Joe put up an NCEP chart depicting the temperature anomaly for the coming days ahead for Europe and also warned of possible snowfall for Germany:

Though temperatures that are 6°C below normal are not really so unusual, what is unusual is the forecast for snow for this time of year. Recall how top climatologists, e.g. David Viner and Mojib Latif, told us 15 years ago snow would disappear even in the wintertime – never mind late April.
Great Britain has already gotten a taste of the white stuff and cold that is about to hit the remainder of Europe.
Little wonder climatologists have had to scramble and think up of new reasons to explain the inconvenient cold events and the overall warming pause. Many of these reasons have been nothing new, and have been in fact long well-known. Like the Rossby Waves, for example.
Though they ignore the many studies showing weather extremes have not increased, the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) has produced a video explaining the Rossby Waves, which I think is very useful.

But as is always the case with the PIK, one has to be careful when discerning fact from theory, or just plain alarmist fantasy, in the information they put out. The general rule for the PIK is: If it’s alarmist, then it’s science. If it’s not alarmist, then they ignore it or downplay it.
Also note how in his daily video Joe Bastardi reminds us that the “permanent drought” forecasts for Texas recently made by “climate experts” have suddenly and already crumbled as the region gets doused by heavy rainfall. Yet another alarmist scenario that has turned out to be totally bogus.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming alarmists like to tell us that we can all trust the global warming science – because “97% of all scientists – an overwhelming consensus -” agree with the science. They just couldn’t possibly be wrong, could they?
Unfortunately history shows us that whenever such claims of consensus are used as the main argument to support a science theory, then it is very likely totally wrong. Yes, the earth used to be flat.
Today we see the latest great example of this, made crystal clear by a new study just released by the University of Eastern Finland titled:
High-cholesterol diet, eating eggs do not increase risk of heart attack, not even in persons genetically predisposed, study finds
Recall how for decades we were warned of the serious dangers of saturated fats and cholesterol in our diets. By the 1980s, 99% of all physicians, heart surgeons, the AMA; NAS, AHA, nutritionists -you name it – all full-heartedly agreed. The US government and health institutions worldwide even made it official policy to promote the high carb, lowfat diet as consequence. Today we see the devastating result: a catastrophic global epidemic of obesity and obesity related diseases that is set to bankrupt health care systems internationally.
In the meantime, Big AG and Big Pharma raked in trillions with the blood of tens of milllions dripping from their hands.
Remember how were told to limit out intake of eggs. Well, the University of East Finland has just released the results of a comprehensivbe study on eggs and heart health. They show:
…a relatively high intake of dietary cholesterol, or eating one egg every day, are not associated with an elevated risk of incident coronary heart disease. Furthermore, no association was found among those with the APOE4 phenotype, which affects cholesterol metabolism and is common among the Finnish population.”

The findings were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Again recall that this all totally flies in the face of almost 50 years of science once deemed as indisputable, as is junk climate science today.
Science Daily writes the dietary habits of 1032 men aged between 42 and 60 years were assessed and the study found that the consumption of eggs, which are rich in dietary cholesterol, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease.
The study did not establish a link between dietary cholesterol or eating eggs with thickening of the common carotid artery walls, either.”
They found nothing, absolutely NADA! No risk!
The fact is that the story of cholesterol is one of scientific fraud (see starting at 19:00) conducted by the shady manufacturers of plant-based “food” oils and Big Agriculture.
The real heart killer is turning out to be plant-based oils (e.g. canola, cottonseed, corn oil, etc.) peddled by Big Ag, and the highly processed carbohydrates from US food industry, in part with the blessing of a greedy pharmaceutical industry. 

Slowly we are finding out that the 50-year long high-carb low-fat scam is turning out to be the crime of the 20th century.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat’s new on solar energy? Overview of the latest papers on complex topic of sun/climate
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
More than three years ago (February 2012) our book Die kalte Sonne (see right) made its debut. In it we described a vast variety of scientific results underpinning the significant impacts of solar activity fluctuations on climate. Leading climate scientists suddenly saw their CO2-dominant view threatened and so they launched an all out onslaught against the solar theories.For one or two of these IPCC-climate warriors the overreaction has since then perhaps even become a bit embarrassing. Over the past years it has become increasingly clear that the role of the sun on climate has long been underestimated. Recent studies show this, and we will point these out at this blog in the days ahead.What’s new on the subject of the sun?In the search for literature the first place to start is at the “Club de Soleil“ website operated by climate scientist Maarten Blaauw of Queen’s University of Belfast. So far in 2015 Blaauw has presented 23 papers – in just the first 8 months alone, and there’s still one third of the year to go. The most recent are two summary papers by David Douglas and Robert Knox appearing in the April 2015 Physics Letters A. The authors found a clear solar signal in ocean temperatures:
Part 1:
The Sun is the climate pacemaker I. Equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures
Equatorial Pacific Ocean temperature time series data contain segments showing both a phase-locked annual signal and a phase-locked signal of period two years or three years, both locked to the annual solar cycle. Three such segments are observed between 1990 and 2014. It is asserted that these are caused by a solar forcing at a frequency of 1.0 cycle/yr. These periodic features are also found in global climate data (following paper). The analysis makes use of a twelve-month filter that cleanly separates seasonal effects from data. This is found to be significant for understanding the El Niño/La Niña phenomenon.
Part 2:
The Sun is the climate pacemaker II. Global ocean temperatures
In part I, equatorial Pacific Ocean temperature index SST3.4 was found to have segments during 1990–2014 showing a phase-locked annual signal and phase-locked signals of 2- or 3-year periods. Phase locking is to an inferred solar forcing of 1.0 cycle/yr. Here the study extends to the global ocean, from surface to 700 and 2000 m. The same phase-locking phenomena are found. The El Niño/La Niña effect diffuses into the world oceans with a delay of about two months.”

There’s a discussion of the two papers at WUWT.
In April 2014 The Hockey Schtick site pointed out that accumulated solar energy is possibly a far better approach for a comparison to the temperature curve. This can be attributed to the climate system’s huge inertia. You can plot here on your own. The result is amazing.
Also very interesting is a Chinese paper from June, 2014, made public by the Science China Press with the following press release:
Has solar activity influence on the Earth’s global warming?
A recent study demonstrates the existence of significant resonance cycles and high correlations between solar activity and the Earth’s averaged surface temperature during centuries. This provides a new clue to reveal the phenomenon of global warming in recent years.
Their work, entitled “Periodicities of solar activity and the surface temperature variation of the Earth and their correlations” was published in CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN (In Chinese) 2014 No.14 with the co-corresponding authors of Dr. Zhao Xinhua and Dr. Feng Xueshang from State key laboratory of space weather, CSSAR/NSSC, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It adopts the wavelet analysis technique and cross correlation method to investigate the periodicities of solar activity and the Earth’s temperature as well as their correlations during the past centuries.
Global warming is one of the hottest and most debatable issues at present. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claimed that the release of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases contributed to 90% or even higher of the observed increase in the global average temperature in the past 50 years. However, the debate on the causes of the global warming never stops. Research shows that the current warming does not exceed the natural fluctuations of climate. The climate models of IPCC seem to underestimate the impact of natural factors on the climate change, while overstate that of human activities. Solar activity is an important ingredient of natural driving forces of climate. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate the influence of solar variability on the Earth’s climate change on long time scales.

This innovative study combines the measured data with those reconstructed to disclose the periodicities of solar activity during centuries and their correlations with the Earth’s temperature. The obtained results demonstrate that solar activity and the Earth’s temperature have significant resonance cycles, and the Earth’s temperature has periodic variations similar to those of solar activity (Figure 1). This study also implies that the “modern maximum” of solar activity agrees well with the recent global warming of the Earth. A significant correlation between them can be found (Figure 2). As pointed out by a peer reviewer, “this work provides a possible explanation for the global warming”.

In August 2014 Maliniemi and colleagues described in the Journal of Geophysical Research a relationship between winter temperatures of the northern hemisphere and sunspot cycles:
Spatial distribution of Northern Hemisphere winter temperatures during different phases of the solar cycle
Several recent studies have found variability in the Northern Hemisphere winter climate related to different parameters of solar activity. While these results consistently indicate some kind of solar modulation of tropospheric and stratospheric circulation and surface temperature, opinions on the exact mechanism and the solar driver differ. Proposed drivers include, e.g., total solar irradiance (TSI), solar UV radiation, galactic cosmic rays, and magnetospheric energetic particles. While some of these drivers are difficult to distinguish because of their closely similar variation over the solar cycle, other suggested drivers have clear differences in their solar cycle evolution. For example, geomagnetic activity and magnetospheric particle fluxes peak in the declining phase of the sunspot cycle, in difference to TSI and UV radiation which more closely follow sunspots. Using 13 solar cycles (1869–2009), we study winter surface temperatures and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) during four different phases of the sunspot cycle: minimum, ascending, maximum, and declining phase. We find significant differences in the temperature patterns between the four cycle phases, which indicates a solar cycle modulation of winter surface temperatures. However, the clearest pattern of the temperature anomalies is not found during sunspot maximum or minimum, but during the declining phase, when the temperature pattern closely resembles the pattern found during positive NAO. Moreover, we find the same pattern during the low sunspot activity cycles of 100 years ago, suggesting that the pattern is largely independent of the overall level of solar activity.”
And finally we present a paper by Nicola Scafetta appearing in the Elsevier journal Physica A in November 2014: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications. It is a discussion of a paper by Gil-Alana et al. whereby the authors claimed solar activity fluctuations had no impact on climate. However there is indeed a relationship that is in fact more complex than that assumed by Gil-Alana and colleagues. The Abstract of Scafetta‘s discussion:
Global temperatures and sunspot numbers. Are they related? Yes, but non linearly. A reply to Gil-Alana et al. (2014)
Recently Gil-Alana et al. (2014) compared the sunspot number record and the temperature record and found that they differ: the sunspot number record is characterized by a dominant 11-year cycle while the temperature record appears to be characterized by a “singularity” or “pole” in the spectral density function at the “zero  ” frequency. Consequently, they claimed that the two records are characterized by substantially different statistical fractional models and rejected the hypothesis that the Sun influences significantly global temperatures. I will show that: (1) the “singularity” or “pole” in the spectral density function of the global surface temperature at the “zero” frequency does not exist—the observed pattern derives from the post 1880 warming trend of the temperature signal and is a typical misinterpretation that discrete power spectra of non-stationary signals can suggest; (2) appropriate continuous periodograms clarify the issue and also show a signature of the 11-year solar cycle (amplitude ≤0.1°C), which since 1850 has an average period of about 10.4 year, and of many other natural oscillations; (3) the solar signature in the surface temperature record can be recognized only using specific techniques of analysis that take into account non-linearity and filtering of the multiple climate change contributions; (4) the post 1880-year temperature warming trend cannot be compared or studied against the sunspot record and its 11-year cycle, but requires solar proxy models showing short and long scale oscillations plus the contribution of anthropogenic forcings, as done in the literature. Multiple evidences suggest that global temperatures and sunspot numbers are quite related to each other at multiple time scales. Thus, they are characterized by cyclical fractional models. However, solar and climatic indexes are related to each other through complex and non-linear processes. Finally, I show that the prediction of a semi-empirical model for the global surface temperature based on astronomical oscillations and anthropogenic forcing proposed by Scafetta since 2009 has, up to date, been successful.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterExamining the hard data on sea ice extent at the Earth’s poles, it would be very tough to argue that the globe is warming.
Melting has stopped in the Arctic
In the Arctic sea ice extent has indeed on average dropped a million square kilometers. But a look at the plotted sea ice anomaly data we see that sea ice has in fact stabilized over the past 11 years. And when one looks at the past 5 years, we see a rising trend.

Arctic sea ice anomaly (click chart to enlarge): Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/arctic.png
Today the Arctic sea ice anomaly is some 742,000 square kilometers below the satellite mean. This is well within the range of natural variability. The truth is that over the past 10 years Arctic sea ice anomaly was below the 2 million sq. km. negative deviation only for a few weeks, and these events were mostly weather related.
Antarctica solidly above normal last 20 years
For global warming alarmists, Antarctica has been the huge inconvenience. A look at the plotted data over the past 20 years tells us that the mean Antarctic sea ice has been solidly above the long-term mean:

Antarctic sea ice anomaly. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu.png
Two points are of great interest in Antarctica: 1) Sea ice recently stayed above normal for a period of more than 3 years, from 2012 to 2015. This is something that had never happened before during the satellite period. 2) The sea ice (long-term) trend in Antarctica over the past 30 years has undisputedly been one of steady rise. This has shocked a number of now very baffled climate scientists.
Overall total global sea ice has been rising robustly over the past four years. To say that global sea ice melting has accelerated over the past years is totally false. The opposite is true, as the following chart shows:

Global sea ice in fact has been at normal levels over the past three years. This is good news that obviously has yet to be communicated to the climate catastrophe-obsessed conference-goers in Paris.

by Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The central star of our solar system was quite inactive last month. The measured solar sunspot number (SSN) was 57.7.  That is only 79% of what is the average for this time point into a solar cycle compared to the mean of the 23 previous complete cycles. What follows is a comparison:

Figure 1: The current solar cycle 24 (red) in relation to the mean of all the other previous 23 solar cycles (blue), and to the very similar solar cycle no. 5, which ended in 1810.
For the complete years of the current cycle, a plot of the activity percentage with respect to the mean appears as follows:

Figure 2: Relative sunspot activity of each calendar year for solar cycle no. 24.
For the entire solar cycle so far (now 7 years and 1 month) the sun’s activity has reached only 56% of the mean solar cycle. The deviation from the mean for the accumulated sunspots of the individual cycles 7 years and one month into the cycle are plotted as follows:

Figure 3: The accumulated solar sunspot anomalies from the mean cycle (blue in Figure 1) for each cycle, 7 years and one month into the cycle.
It is clear to see that the phase between solar cycle no. 17 (started in 1933) and the end of solar cycle no. 23 in 2008 was the most active since systematic observations began. That phase was abruptly ended by the current cycle.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMike Shellenberger, President of Environmental Progress and Time Magazine ‘Hero of the Environment’, appeared dismayed when he tweeted here that Germany CO2 emissions rose over 1% in 2015, as the following chart shows:

Graph by Clean Energy Wire, data from German Environment Agency (UBA) and Green Budget Germany. More here. 
In 2015 Germany’s Co2 emissions rose to 912 million tonnes, up from 902 million tonnes from a year earlier and from 906 million tonnes way back in 2009. Overall Germany’s CO2 emissions savings have trended slightly upwards over the past 7 years.
Megan Darby at Climate Home here calls the development “a blow to the country’s claims to climate leadership“.
Schellenberger has every reason to be shocked by the 2015 result.
1. 2015 was Germany’s second warmest year on record, meaning fuel consumed for heating had to have been low.
2. Germany has invested tens of billions of euros in its bid to switch to CO2-free energy sources. Angela Merkel top aide Peter Altmaier warned that the Energiewende would cost 1 trillion euros.
3. Consumers, who were  once into thinking it wasn’t going to cost much, are now paying close to the highest electricity prices worldwide. One kilowatt-hour costing close to €30 cents. Hundreds of thousands of households are having their power cut off because they can no longer afford to pay their power bills.

4. Germany power grid is now more unstable than it has been in decades. That fact in combination with the high electricity prices is driving industry out.
5. Germany’s per capita CO2 emissions are among the highest in the world.
6. About half of Germany’s CO2 reductions since 1990 resulted from the shut-down of former communist East Germany’s inefficient state-run industry.
7. Wind parks have blighted much of the country’s idyllic landscape and thousands of people are now suffering from health damage due to infrasound. Planned windparks are facing increasingly ferocious protests from nature protection and citizens groups.
8. 2016 will likely also see no reductions – thanks to the low petroleum prices and colder weather so far.
Socialism and energy!
In summary Germany’s Energiewende has been an extremely costly government-intervention debacle of monumental dimensions. We haven’t seen such a large-scale industrial mismanagement since the collapse of the USSR and the German Democratic Republic. Recall that not only did their industry collapse into a heap of rubble, but they too also left huge environmental damage that we are still cleaning up 25 years later.
And no one in his/her right mind expects Germany to meet its 2020 target, let alone 2030. Other countries have to be insane (or have lots of money to burn) to follow the German example.

I would like to thank a faithful warmist commenter for inspiring this research.
His claim for my mental state seen here, in The 85-year Pause, forced me to “put up, or shut up” on the subject of warming seasonality and the reasons for it. To that end, I added many more stations to my list to be examined, and plotted monthly data instead of just two seasons.
First, some discussion on CO2 warming theory, a subject on which this faithful warmist commentator claims some expertise. I searched the web for any illustrations of monthly downward long-wave radiation. I finally found them at ScienceOfDoom.com, here. Please click on the link.
Twelve different stations are shown, with modeled and observed month-of-year data. The data for each of these stations closely matches the local insolation (sunshine hours), with a maximum in the local summer, especially for polar and middle latitudes.
One would think, that with more downward IR in the local summer, and with increasing CO2, that the resulting warming would be in the summer also. That is not the case.
Some signal theory: electrical engineers, physicists, and technicians that have ever used a digital oscilloscope will be familiar with signal averaging. When a faint signal is synchronous with a larger signal, triggering the oscilloscope on the larger signal and averaging many times will bring out the faint signal even in the presence of large random noise. In this case, the annual CO2 warming signal synchronized with the months of the year in the presence of weather.
Based on the hours of daylight for each month, here is an example of what the CO2 warming should look like for Bismarck, North Dakota, and the stations around it:

Figure 1: Number of sunshine hours per month for Bismarck, North Dakota, USA. The peak is in July, the low point is in November and December. The months of the year are numbered from January with two years shown. The source link is here. Click on Climate Data For Bismarck Airport.
For all the station data downloaded from GISTemp, I split the data into two sets: from 1947 to 1980, and from 1981 to 2015. I then computed the by-month average for each set, then subtracted the first set from the second. The result is the by month average warming between 1947 to 1980, and 1981 to 2015.
Here is the result for 8 stations in North Dakota, USA. The “adjusted” data was used for all plots. As GISS uses the same adjustments for all months of the same year, the other data sets would only move these plots vertically by small amounts without changing the shape.

Figure 2: Warming by month for 8 stations in North Dakota. Two years are shown to show a full winter in the center of the plot. The months are numbered from January. These stations are all within a few hundred kilometers of each other, so show very similar trends. The dark red trace is the average. The peak is in January.

Note that the warming in North Dakota is completely out of phase with the sunshine hours, thus out of phase with any possible CO2 warming.
Thirteen Russian stations were examined in the same fashion. This area is supposedly warming faster than anywhere else according to the temperature anomaly maps from GISS. These stations are spread across the nation from Moscow to eastern Siberia. There was more variation here, so a plot of all 13 is a classic spaghetti diagram. Here is a plot of the 13 stations with the average highlighted in black. Moscow (Moskva) is in slightly bolder red.

Figure 3: Plot of the average monthly warming for 13 Russian stations. Two years are shown. The months with the most warming are January, February, and March.
Where is the winter warming coming from? It is the wrong season for the cause to be increased CO2. I was not able to find energy usage for Russia, but here is the energy usage for the U.S.:

Figure 4: Energy usage in the United States by month of the year. The top curve is the average energy usage after 1980; the bottom curve is energy usage from 1970 to 1980, the only monthly data available from the U. S. Energy Administration here.
Annual residential energy usage in the United States has quadrupled since 1949, and the variation shown above is primarily due to residential energy usage. Note the increase in usage in July and August, primarily from increased air conditioning.
Here are 12 more stations in the U. S. Midwest and South. The black line is the average.

Figure 5: Plot of the by-month warming in 12 locations in the US mid-west and south. 
In the US midwest and south, the least warming (slightly cooling) is in October. The peak warming is March. All the cities have peak warming between November and March, completely out of sync with any possible CO2 warming and in sync with residential heating.
These diagrams all show a large negative spike in either September (Russia) or October (in the US). Why should this be? These are the months where the air conditioners are turned off and the heating has yet to be turned on, thus they are the months with the least energy use.
There is no way that CO2 is causing this warming in the winter months. If CO2 was the culprit, we would see warming following the diagrams linked above on the SOD website. The back-radiation from CO2 is real. It just doesn’t have any effect, or the effect is offset by something else. Instead we see warming following energy use. We can keep the climate from warming. But it means freezing to death.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecall how man-made CO2 emissions are supposed to cause a greenhouse effect in the troposphere, meaning the stratosphere above it is supposed to cool. Lately, that has not been the case at all – at least over the northern hemisphere, 65°N and above, over the better part of the last year.
Schneefan here writes on an interesting phenomenon now taking place in the Arctic stratosphere. Much of what follows is a translation, along with some points I’ve added myself.
The upper stratosphere over the Arctic, her writes, has never been so warm in March since satellite records began back in 1979: a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) with an expected splitting of the polar vortex is underway (polar vortex split).

The plot above shows the sudden warming (red line) on March 7, 2016 (day 67 of the year) occurring in the upper stratosphere at 10 hPa (approx. 30 km altitude), between 65°N and 90°N. The red line significantly surpassed the high mark (upper black line) for March and is far above average (line with green dots). Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/. 
Through the strong warming and related pressure increase, a warm high has formed over the Arctic in place of the cold polar vortex. This means the polar vortex will split over the coming days and get displaced southwards – (polar vortex split):

ECMWF projection of March 8, 2016 for temperatures in the upper atmosphere at 10 hPa (approx. 30 km altitude) for March 16, 2016. The polar vortex has split due to the high pressure caused by the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) over the pole. Two completely separated cold cores form over Siberia and Western Europe/North Atlantic. At this latitude the zonal wind has reversed from west to east. Source: http://www.geo.fu-berlin.html. 
When there is a reversal in the temperature gradient and circulation (west wind shifts to east wind) from 60°N latitiude to the North Pole at in 10 hPa (approx. 30,000 m altitude), this is known as a major warming. Whether or not this ushers in a “final warming” and thus a switch from the Arctic winter to a summertime circulation remains to be seen…
The SSW and expected polar vortex splitting along with the reversal of zonal winds from west to east will also have major impacts on the circulation of air masses at the lower atmospheric levels of the northern hemisphere. The polar jet will meander and lead to enhanced exchange between polar and subtropical air masses: That means more cold air blasts into the middle latitudes are expected for the northern hemisphere.
The ECMWF prognosis from 9 March 20016 consequently sees an intensified March winter 2016 over large parts of Europe. Wintry temperatures at 850 hPa (approx. 1500 m) of -10°C on March 19,2016 over eastern Europe:

ECMWF forecast of March 9, 2016, for temperatures on March 19, 2016, in Europe. Cold Siberian air is expected to flow across Europe between high pressure positioned over the North Atlantic and a low over Russia and southern Europe. Source: www.wetterzentrale.de/html
These unusually cold calculations have been more or less confirmed by other weather models over the past few days. But as everyone knows, forecasts 10 days out are fraught with considerable uncertainty, and so we should not lose hope for milder spring weather.
Yet, this year it looks like we’ll have to wait a little longer than normal. But that shouldn’t surprise us, though, because statistics show that spring has been arriving later and later in Europe over the past 2 decades – and not earlier.

Glacier, Ice Sheet Melt Rates Slowing!
By Kenneth Richard
In recent years glacier and ice sheet melt rates have been rapidly decelerating in several regions of the globe.

For illustration only. By Beeblebrox – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11810995
According to published scientific study by Jacob et al. (2012, Recent Contributions of Glaciers and Ice Caps [GIC] to Sea Level Rise), glaciers and ice caps across the world (excluding Greenland and Antarctica) in total only contributed 0.41 mm/yr (~1.6 inches per century) to sea level rise between 2003 and 2010.
This was an overall 30% deceleration from previous year’s estimates, with glaciers in the high mountains of Asia effectively in balance. The abstract states the results are based on a global, simultaneous inversion of monthly GRACE-derived satellite gravity fields, from which the scientists calculate the mass change over all ice-covered regions greater in area than 100 sq km.
The scientists say that the GIC rate for 2003-2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous mass balance estimate that most closely matches their study period. Particularly the high mountains of Asia show a mass loss of only 4 ± 20 gigatons per year for 2003-2010, compared with 47-55 Gt yr(-1) in previously published estimates.
Examining Jacob et al. (2012) further, the scientists indicate that the 0.41 mm/yr for 2003-2010 is well less than half the melt rate contribution for the first 5 or 6 years of the 21st century (~0.8 to ~1.1 mm/yr), and even slightly less than the rate for the entire 1961-2004 period (0.4 to 0.5 mm/yr).
The scientists conclude:
Excluding Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs [glaciers and ice caps] (PGICs), GICs have variously been reported to have 0.43–0.51 mm yr to sea level rise (SLR) during 1961–2004, 0.77 mm yr during 2001–2004, 1.12 mm yr during 2001–2005 and 0.95 mm yr during 2002–2006.”

Some glaciers have reversed course, and now advancing
Furthermore a recently published (2016) paper indicates that the high mountain glaciers of Asia have actually begun advancing since 2009 (through 2014). A new paper published earlier this year by Zhang, Zhen et al shows similar developments. The scientists state that the glacier mass changes in the Muztag Ata and Kongur Tagh (MAKT) region in the eastern Pamir, northwestern China, is helpful in improving our knowledge of the dynamics of glaciers under a changing climate in High Mountain Asia. They summarize their findings in the paper’s abstract:
Here, glacier area and mass changes derived from remote sensing data are investigated for the period 1971/76–2013/14 for glaciers in MAKT. We have used ASTER images (2013/14), Cartosat-1 (2014) and Landsat, SRTM (Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission) digital elevation model (DEM) (2000), topographic maps (1971/76) and the first and second Chinese glacier inventories (CGIs). Our results indicated that the glacier area of MAKT decreased from 1018.3 ± 12.99 km2 in 1971/ 76 to 999.2 ± 31.22 km2 in 2014 (–1.9 ± 0.2%). Weak area shrinkage of glaciers by 2.5 ± 0.5 km2 (0.2 ± 0.1%) happened after 2000 and the period 2009–2014 even saw a slight expansion by 0.5 ± 0.1 km2 (0.1 ± 0.0%).”
Yet another 2016 paper in the Internal Journal of Quaternary Research authored by a team led by Ireneuzw Sobota indicates that the Aavatsmarkbreen glacier (Svalbard) advanced by over 1 km between 2013 and 2015. The study’s main objective, according to the authors, was to analyse and classify subglacial and supraglacial landforms in the context of glacial deformation and basal sliding over a thin layer of thawed, water-saturated deposits. The study also focused on the geomorphological evidence of surge-related sub- and supraglacial crevassing and glacier front fracturing. The results:
From 2006 to 2013, the average recession of Aavatsmarkbreen was 363 m (52 m a−1). A subsequent surge during 2013–2015 resulted in a substantial advance of the glacier front of over 1 km and an increase in its surface area of more than 2 sq. km.”
This rapid regional (Arctic) glacier expansion since 2013 coincides with Greenland’s recent ice sheet melt deceleration. According to the Arctic Report Card (2015), after losing an average of ~260 Gt per year from 2002 to 2013, ice sheet losses decelerated to -29 gigatons and -186 gigatons in 2013-14 and 2014-15 respectively.
The ice mass loss of 186 Gt over the entire ice sheet between April 2014 and April 2015 was 22% below the average mass loss of 238 Gt for the 2002- 2015 period, but was 6.4 times higher than the 29 Gt loss of the preceding 2013-2014 season. They add:
The net area loss from marine-terminating glaciers during 2014-2015 was 16.5 sq km..  This was the lowest annual net area loss of the period of observations (1999-2015) and 7.7 times lower than the annual average area change trend of -127 sq km.”
And, already for 2016, the surface mass balance (see graph below, blue trend line) is well above the 1990-2013 mean, marking the third straight year of Greenland ice sheet melt deceleration.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German Green Party official Volker Beck has resigned from “several of his posts” amid charges of illegally possessing the drug crystal meth.
Berlin authorities allegedly caught the high-profile politician early this month. He has not yet resigned from his post as a parliamentary member of the Bundestag.
German online weekly FOCUS reports today that Beck told police “the banned substance was not for himself, but for someone else“, thus possibly opening himself up to drug dealing charges.
Frankly I find it peculiar and somewhat telling that the uproar over the affair has been comparatively low-key, giving the impression that Green politicians routinely get off easy whenever involved in scandal.
DW German public radio even went so far as to accuse center right tabloid Bild of being “gleeful” over breaking the news of Beck’s drug possession arrest, writing here that the newspaper “was not slow to drag the politician over its own moral coals, splashing the headline ‘Green caught with Hitler drug!’ on its front page – a reference to the Nazi leader’s regular use of methamphetamines.”
Green Party’s pedophile past
Surprisingly DW reports that Beck used to be a proponent of legalizing sexual contact with children:
In 2013, he raised a furor in Germany when he called for decriminalizing sexual contact with children.”
In the early days of Germany’s Green Party, 1980s and 1990s, the founders loudly called for the legalization of sex with underage children. The Greens‘ advocacy of pedophilia rights was part of the party’s platform as it pushed neo-liberal ideas like “free and open relationships”.

Thomas Birk, Green Party Berlin parliamentarian and author of a commissions report investigating the scandal, mentioned in March, 2015, that there had been “up to 1000 victims”.
Green Party Chairwoman Bettina Jarasch publicly apologized for what she called an “institutional failure”. She said: 
On behalf of the Berlin Greens, we ask for forgiveness.”
According to the Berlin based left-leaning Tagesspiegel here, the investigation and commission report shed light into an “abuse network” within the forerunner of the Green party, the Alternativen Liste, which included at least three leading figures who set up a “youth center” in a Kreuzberg recreational center.
According to witnesses, they abused numerous youths who had been recruited at elementary schools.“
Brown roots
The Green movement has also come under scrutiny and suspicion for its brownish “blood and soil” environmentalist roots and its thinly veiled contempt for the human species.

By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The largest mass of our solar system (99.8% of the total mass) was also rather quiet in January. The determined solar sunspot number (SSN) was 56.6, which is 71% of the mean this far into the period, calculated using the 23 previously measured solar cycles.

Figure 1: Plot of the monthly sunspot number so far for the current cycle (red line) compared to the mean solar cycle (blue line) and the similar solar cycle no. 5 (black).
The earlier peak occurring at month number 35 (fall 2011) signaled the time of the SSN maximum at the sun’s northern hemisphere. The later peaks occurring at about month no. 68 (mid 2014) are the SSN maximum for the sun’s southern hemisphere. What follows is a plot of all cycles, showing the accumulated number of sunspots over the first 86 months into the cycle:

Figure 2: Comparison of sunspot activity for every cycle occurring since 1755. the values represent the deviation from the mean SSN (blue curve in Figure 1).
There are about 3 more years to go before the end of solar cycle no. 24 is reached. When it is finished we will very likely see the red bar representing solar cycle no. 24 in Figure 2 winding up well below that of solar cycle no. 7, which was the last occurring during the Dalton Minimum. That cycle had much more activity in the end phase than what we are seeing in the current cycle.
Prognoses here, however, are fraught with huge uncertainty, as “solar weather” defies all forecasting attempts and no one can say with any certainty what can be expected to happen over the next two years – except for over the long run, the current cycle will end in a rather quiet fashion.
========================
Note from NoTricksZone:
The combination of recent North Atlantic cooling, the projected coming La Niña, and the expected period of low solar activity may see the planet cooling over the next 10 years as fast as it warmed during a few short years in the 1990s. Joe Bastardi’s “Triple Whammy of Cooling” truly is taking shape.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChallenged: 3.2 mm/year sea level rise since 1993
By guest author Kenneth Richard
Source data studies indicate recent only 0.8 – 1.6 mm/year sea level rise.
According to the IPCC (2013), sea levels rose at a rate of 1.7 mm/year (6.7 inches per century) for the 1901 to 2010 period, but 3.2 mm/year (12.6 inches per century) during the 18-year period between 1993 to 2010, a rate similar to that obtained from 1920 to 1950.
If sea levels truly were rising at rates of 3.2 mm/year between 1993 and 2010 as the IPCC (2013) claims with high confidence, then the thermal and ablation sources for that sea level rise should at least somewhat closely add up to 3.2 mm/year for the same period.  But if the sources for the sea level rise as determined by published studies only reach between 0.8 and 1.6 mm/year when added together – a quarter to half of the 3.2 mm/year claimed – then that suggests that there is something seriously questionable about the 3.2 mm/year sea level rise estimates for 1993 to 2010 obtained by satellite altimetry.
What follows is an abridged list of recent papers showing that sea level rise estimations claimed by the IPCC are likely highly exaggerated.
—
http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter13_FINAL.pdf
“It is very likely that the global mean rate was 1.7 mm yr–1 between 1901 and 2010 for a total sea level rise of 0.19 m. Between 1993 and 2010, the rate was very likely higher at 3.2 mm yr–1; similarly high rates likely occurred between 1920 and 1950.”
—
Problematically, in recent decades the source contribution estimates for recent decades from published studies add up to half (or less) of this claimed rate.
According to recent estimates, the contribution to sea level rise from thermal expansion was 0.64 mm/yr (2.5 inches per century) for the period between 2005-2013 (Llovel et al., 2014, see below). The contribution from the Greenland (GIS) and Antarctic (AIS) ice sheets was 0.59 mm/yr (2.3 inches per century) for the 1992-2011 period (Shepherd et al., 2012).  The contribution from global glaciers and ice caps that are not the GIS or AIS was 0.41 mm/yr (1.6 inches per century) for 2003-2010 (Jacob et al., 2012).
—
Llovel et al., 2014
http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n11/full/nclimate2387.html
Over the entire water column, independent estimates of ocean warming yield a contribution of 0.77 ± 0.28 mm yr−1 in sea-level rise … the deep ocean (below 2,000 m) contributes −0.13 ± 0.72 mm yr−1 to global sea-level rise [0.64 mm/yr total].
—
Shepherd et al., 2012
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183
Since 1992, the polar ice sheets [Antarctica and Greenland] have contributed, on average, 0.59 ± 0.20 millimeter year−1 to the rate of global sea-level rise.

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/abs/nature10847.html
Here we show that GICs [glaciers and ice caps], excluding the Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs, lost mass at a rate of 148 ± 30 Gt yr−1 from January 2003 to December 2010, contributing 0.41 ± 0.08 mm yr−1 to sea level rise.
—
These sources add up to about 1.6 mm/year, which is the equivalent of a little over 6 inches per century.  Interestingly, this is the same or slightly less than the rate for the entire 1901 to 2010 period (1.7 mm/year, IPCC), meaning that sea level rise has not accelerated in recent decades according to the summation of source estimates.
Another recent estimate of the sea level contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet (Zwally et al., 2015, see below) for 1992-2008 has East Antarctica ice mass gains exceeding the losses from West Antarctica, indicating a net gain in ice mass for the continent as a whole and a negative sea level contribution of -0.23 mm/year (-0.9 of an inch per century) for 2003 to 2008.
—
http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/igsoc/jog/2015/00000061/00000230/art00001
Mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet impact sea-level rise as climate changes, but recent rates have been uncertain. Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data (2003–08) show mass gains from snow accumulation exceeded discharge losses by 82 ± 25 Gt a–1, reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm a–1. European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS) data (1992–2001) give a similar gain of 112 ± 61 Gt a–1.
—
https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses
“The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said.
—
Along with the sea level decline equivalent of -0.23 mm/year for 2003-2008 due to ice gains of +82 Gt per year between 2003 and 2008, we can compute the sea level loss equivalent for 1992-2001 as -0.31 mm/yr, as 1992-2001 had a higher rate of mass gain (+112 Gt/year) for the Antarctic ice sheet as a whole.  Averaged together, the Zwally et al. (2015) study indicates that Antarctica took away -0.28 mm/yr (-1.1 inches) from sea levels over 1992-2008.
Using this -0.28 mm/year estimate for Antarctica’s ice melt contribution instead of the Shepherd et al. (2012) estimate of 0.19 mm/year (0.7 of an inch per century), but yet continuing to use the Shepherd et al. (2012) estimate for Greenland’s ice sheet contribution (0.4 mm/year) reduces the polar ice sheet contribution from 0.59 mm/year to 0.12 mm/year, which is a sea level contribution of half an inch (0.5) per century from both polar ice sheets combined.
This change of -0.47 mm/year effectively reduces the 1.6 mm/year source estimate from above to between 1.1 and 1.2 mm/year, a little over 4 inches per century.
The template for the above source analysis of sea level rise contributions was provided in the journal Science  by Cabanes et al., 2001.  Here is their summary for the last few decades of the 20th century.
—
http://people.uncw.edu/grindlayn/GLY550/sealevel-topex-science-2001.pdf
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates the various factors that have contributed to the 20th century sea level rise. The largest contribution (0.7 mm/year sea level rise) arises from thermal expansion due to warming of the oceans that mainly occurred since the 1950s. Melting of continental glaciers produces 0.2 to 0.4 mm/year sea level rise. Estimated Greenland and Antarctica mass imbalance (accounting for a long-term readjustment since Last Glacial Maximum plus a climate-related response) contributes –0.2 to 0.6 mm/year. The least certain contribution is the change in terrestrial water storage that results partly from human activities, which is in the range of –1.1 to + 0.4 mm/year with a median value of −0.35 mm/year (i.e., corresponding to sea level drop). The sum of these contributions ranges from −0.8 to 2.2 mm/year, with a median value of 0.7 mm/year.
—
Notice that in this analysis, “terrestrial water storage” is included in the contribution budget, and this amounted to -0.35 mm/year (with a range of “–1.1 to + 0.4 mm/year”)  for the late 20th century.  A more recent estimate is apparently not available, but it is likely a fair assumption that these parameters for terrestrial water storage haven’t changed significantly during the first decade of the 21 century compared to the last decades of the 20th.  Therefore, it would be reasonable to include this value among the source contributions to recent sea level rise.  This would effectively reduce the 1.1 to 1.2 mm/year rate described above (using Zwally et al., 2015) to about 0.8 mm/year, which is very similar to the 0.7 mm/year calculated for the last decades of the 20th century by Cabanes et al., 2001.  A rate of 0.8 mm/year is equivalent to about 3 inches per century.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel has the latest analysis of the climate haggling going on at COP21. It looks pretty heated.
From science journalist Axel Bojanowski‘s perspective, the representatives have encountered some major obstacles. He writes of a “huge clamor” and reports that the treaty is on the brink. He writes, citing delegates, the negotiations have been charged with “harsh threats” and “sick pride”:
 China, India, USA, EU and the oil producing nations downright crashed against each other with full force in the negotiations.”
Bojanowski writes of swirling discord over the 2°C target, noting that a group of countries led by the USA and the EU wish to adopt the “highly ambitious” 1.5°C target, which means the planet would only have 0.5°C of allowable warming remaining.
Theoretically that would require an immediate stop in emissions growth – something that in reality is pure fantasy. Saudi Arabia wants nothing to do with the 1.5°C target and, according to Bojanowski, is threatening to “bust the fragile alliance of developing countries, the so-called Group 77”.
The Spiegel report portrays a conflictive atmosphere where developing countries are pitted against industrial ones. The former are demanding that the latter pony up for the “damage” caused and be given leeway in emitting carbon. However the USA delegation insists industrial countries commit to reductions as well, “especially China”, where pro capita CO2 emissions are already approaching EU levels.
Although the media (at least in Germany) are projecting a cooperative and constructive atmosphere in place in Paris, the Spiegel report tells us the opposite, where a huge chasm still remains between industrial developed countries and the emerging countries. Bojanowski writes that the current draft treaty has enraged the USA delegation” because it calls on the developed nation to “allocate financial support” while other countries “contribute voluntarily” – a condition in the main part of the treaty that would never pass the US Congress. China insists that this clause remain in the main part.
Bojanowski writes that China “feels provoked” by the newly formed “High Ambitious Coalition” which comprises the USA, EU and poor developing countries – which China used to represent – and is now “unwilling to compromise“, Bojanowski reports.
The Treaty is far from being ready, and there is still a chance that the whole process could collapse. Expect the bazaar to last through the weekend.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe first 2016 hurricane season predictions are starting to come out. And if the one by Global Weather Oscillations is on the right track, then US coastal areas may want to already start bracing for greater hurricane activity.

In fact this year we should expect US hurricanes to very likely play a crucial role in the US presidential elections, especially amid the climate change hysteria within the mainstream media and Democrat alarmist politicians. Recall what happened in 2012.
Strongest in over 4 years
Former NOAA meteorologist David Dilley of Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) says the 2016 and 2017 Atlantic hurricane seasons will be the strongest in over 4 years, and have the most United States hurricane landfalls since 11 were experienced during the destructive seasons of 2004 and 2005.
GWO has issued the most accurate predictions of any organization over the past 7 years, and says that unlike the past three hurricane seasons, which were dominated by hostile atmospheric conditions that subdued hurricane activity, the next few years will be in a “Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle” that will provide very favorable conditions for development of tropical storms and hurricanes.
The Atlantic Basin Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to December 1, and on the average has 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 or 3 major hurricanes. The 2015 hurricane season officially ended with 11 named storms, 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes. Hurricane Alex formed on January 14th of this year, only 6 weeks following the official ending of the 2015 season – but nearly 5 months prior to the beginning of the 2016 hurricane season. Alex was officially called the first hurricane of the 2016 Hurricane Season, based on the January to December Gregorian January – not the natural climate and weather calendar that drives development of tropical storms during a season.
But with Hurricane Alex being more closely attached to the 2015 into early 2016 El Niño and the climate season – this means the 2015 hurricane season actually had 1 additional named storm and hurricane. This brings the total for the 2015 season up to 12 named storms and 5 hurricanes, which is very close to the long term average of 12 named storms and 6 hurricanes.
El Niños normally suppress hurricanes, but…

The numbers for the 2015 season are very important when it comes to predicting the upcoming hurricane seasons. The occurrence of an El Niño during a hurricane season typically suppresses the number of named storms significantly – but it did not in 2015 – and this is a signal for what is in-store the next few seasons.
CEO David Dilley of GWO says the combination of the El Niño ending before the 2016 hurricane season, and the high number of named storms (12) connected to the 2015 season, signals that a “Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle” is now in place, and this will provide very favorable atmospheric conditions for hurricane development and landfalls during the next couple of years.
Most dangerous and costly in over 10 years
Mr. Dilley predicts the upcoming 2016 and 2017 seasons will be much stronger than the past three seasons, and it will likely be the most dangerous and costly period in over 10 years. The 2016 season will have 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. Three of the GWO United States prediction zones are at high risk for hurricane conditions in 2016. One of the zones has a high risk for a major impact hurricane. The 2017 season will be more dangerous and costly than 2016, with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and several of the GWO prediction zones will be at high risk for major impact hurricanes. Over the two year period, GWO expects 5 to 8 United States Hurricane Hot Spots.
Models predict hurricanes 2 to 3 years in advance
GWO is the only organization that issues detailed preseason predictions two years into the future for 11 United States prediction zones from New England to Texas. GWO’s predictions have been the most accurate of any organization the past 7 years, and GWO is the only organization that predicted the occurrence of Hurricane Ike (2008), Irene (2011), and Sandy (2012). Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were predicted 2 to 3 years in advance.
What makes GWO standout from other organizations is their commitment to research and development of GWO’s “Climate Pulse Technology” (CPT). The CPT prediction model incorporates natural mechanisms that control the rhythm of weather and climate cycles, which in-turn control future hurricane paths. Research over the past 30 years has found that each of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal zones have different weather cycles, and within each cycle, there exists smaller weather cycles which make each zone unique. Once all of the cycles are discovered, GWO then uses the Climate Pulse Technology to accurately assess the intensity of a future hurricane seasons, and the probability risk for hurricane or tropical storm conditions within a prediction zone for that year.
GWO Webinars, detailed hurricane zone predictions, prediction performance over the past 7 years, graphics, and the “free” climate change e-book “Earth’s Natural Climate Pulse” (authored by David Dilley) can be acquired through the Global Weather Oscillatlions web site. In addition, an interactive electronic subscription to the GWO’s hurricane predictions can also be acquired through GWO’s working partner XtremeGIS the risk management division of the Wall Street Network.
87% accuracy
When GWO predicts a high probability for hurricane conditions within one of their prediction zones, it is red-flagged as a hurricane or tropical storm “Hot Spot”. GWO’s hot spot predictions for the United States have been nearly 87 percent accurate since 2006, and instrumental for long-range planning by companies and other organizations. GWO is the only organization that predicts hurricane conditions for specific zones, and for up to 4 years in advance. Detailed predictions for the 11 hurricane zones can be obtained by going to the Global Weather Oscillations web site.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce dismissed as something merely imagined by people close to industrial wind turbines, health disorders caused by infrasound are emerging as being very real.
Austrian site www.ots.at here has a press release by the Vienna Chamber of Physicians warning of health hazards from large-scale wind turbines, citing “comprehensive studies”. It calls for a minimum setback distance from built-up areas.
The OTS writes that noise from wind turbines is increasingly coming under the focus of scientific studies. Low frequency infrasound (< 20 Hz) was dismissed by wind energy proponents, but rapidly mounting evidence show the problem is more serious than first thought.
As part of the “International Noise Awareness Day” the Austrian Chamber of Physicians warns that today’s large size wind turbines have a blade diameter as large as a football pitch and a blade tip speed near 300 km/hr. They therefore create noise in the infrasound frequency range, which is known to cause health problems. Physician Piero Lercher of the Chamber of physicians: say:
Our target must be to prevent sleep disorder, psychological affects and irreversible damage to hearing from the noise such as that produced by wind turbines.”
The press release reports of increasing complaints stemming from low frequency infrasound and says studying the health impacts “is essential”.

Lercher adds that another component may be at play:
Perception disorders of persons living nearby are thought to be perhaps triggered by a ‘nocebo’ effect .”
Anti-wind energy group windwahn.de here thanks the physicians from Vienna for looking at the concerns of residents seriously, as many are ill and others are confronted by the threat of years of “acoustic torture” from proposed wind projects. Windwhn cites studies from all around the world and that it is time for Germany to wake up to this reality. The site writes:
We can no longer ignore the one third of residents in wind power regions who are sound injured and have serious health consequences!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote of an interview with physicist Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, published at the website of the German Employers Association (DAV) here, on the minimal role of CO2 on the world’s climate.

German professor calls climate protection a “dangerous, undemocratic ideology”.
Due to the length of the interview I focused only on a part of it. Today I will write on the other important comments made by Prof. Lüdecke relating to climate models, Germany’s energy policy and the climate protection ideology.
Decarbonization “gross nonsense”
On the endeavor to “protect the climate” through cutting CO2 emissions, something often called decarbonization, Lüdecke calls it “gross nonsense” and tells us that a changing climate is “a law of nature“. He adds that there is no evidence that CO2 is “harmful to the climate” and that it strongly warms it”.
Lüdecke tells the DAV that strong warming is found only in models that use dubious assumptions and effects:
Whether or not these effects are based on reliable data is of no interest to the modelers. This is how one gets the temperature rise that one desires.  The only problem is that these models have not been able to reproduce the past. The climate models simply don’t work. They are wrong. Amazingly that does not bother the climate alarmists.”
The retired German professor also slams the media for uncritically blaring out every alarmists claim, no matter how foolish it may be, and shutting out reasonable voices. Whenever an alarmist prediction fails to appear, “a new one such as ocean acidification gets paraded out in the public“.
On Germany’s trillion-euro attempt to curb CO2 emissions, Lüdecke calls the effort “absurd”, claiming that the country’s share of global CO2 is only a tiny fraction of the total emitted globally, and that the government’s target would result in a temperature difference of “only a few thousandths of a degree over the next 20 years“. He calls it a “purely political agenda“, summarizing:

Factually it is therefore totally idiotic what we are doing.”
On sea level rise and ice melt, Lüdecke reminds us that sea level rise is happening at a perfectly normal range of 1 to 3 mm per year, depending on the data source, and that there is no evidence of anything alarming happening. To put things into there proper context, he tells the readers that it would take Greenland ice 5000 years to melt even if the temperature rose 5°C. “By then we’ll likely be already well into another ice age.”
Greenland temperature has dropped 2.5°C
A warming of Greenland is very unlikely, according to Lüdecke:
A scientific publication using data from ice core analyses show that the mean temperature of Greenland has fallen 2.5°C over the past 8000 years.”
Brutal dictator
On what is driving the climate alarmism, Lüdecke tells the DAV:
It’s all an ideology, a mixture of well-known Marxism, Nature Romanticism and the interests of powerful investors and politicians. […] not at all about good, but rather about a brutal dictator that wants to tell us which lights to use, that we’re no longer allowed to eat meat – in short, how we are to live.” […]
The aim of the eco-ideology is in reality another society – undemocratic and dictatorial. Ecology here is only an instrument. […]
Climate change is a dangerous undemocratic ideology.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo far we’ve been seeing lots of signs of a cold coming winter: birds migrating from Siberia to Britain weeks early, unusual early-autumn snowfalls across Europe, various reports warning of the worst winter in decades etc.
In August, weather analyst Gavin Partridge put up one of his weather videos here. In it he looks at past solar activity, the current Solar Cycle no. 24, and its strong similarity to Solar Cycle no. 12.

Our current Solar Cycle 24 is similar to Solar Cycle 12 (December 1878 to March 1890), Partridge says. Source of data: SIDC.
What’s fascinating is that there have been a number of studies showing how Great Britain’s winters seem to be highly impacted by solar activity. During weak cycles, Great Britain’s winters tend to be dominated by large blocking highs which steer cold air masses across the country for a larger part of the winter season and so result in colder and snowier winters.
The following chart shows Solar Cycle no. 12 (marked in yellow) compared to all the previous cycles.

Our current solar cycle 24 is shaping to be very similar to Solar Cycle 12 of the 1880s. So will Britain’s winters of Cycle No. 24 follow those of Cycle No. 12?  Partridge tells us in his video.
Partridge states that although Cycle 24 is not as weak as solar numbers 5 & 6, it is substantially weaker than normal and that it is strikingly similar to Cycle no. 12 of the 1870s and 1880s. The question is can we compare the winters of both cycles? Partridge does precisely that and comes up with stunning similarities between the winters of both cycles, depicted in the following chart.

The thin blue line shows the current cycle. The bold blue line depicts Cycle No. 24. The dark blue bars show the temperature anomaly of the Cycle 11/12 winters, while the light blue bars show the corresponding temperature anomaly for the Cycle 23/24 winters. Source: here.
Partridge’s chart above shows how the winter trends of both cycles correspond – almost stunningly.  Seven of eight winters were in agreement regarding whether the winter was colder or warmer than normal – or normal. Last winter (2014/15) was very close to normal, as was the 1884/84 winter.
For example at the end of Solar Cycle 11 and Solar Cycle 23 in 1877/78 and 2008/09 respectively, both saw colder than normal winters – as did the following 1878/79 (2009/10), 1879/80 (2010/11) and 1880/81 (2011/12) winters.
As both Solar Cycles no. 12 and 24 became active, the respective 4 subsequent winters were milder and averaged above normal. Last winter (2014/15 – which corresponds 1884/85) showed cooling and was close to average – same was the case for the 1884/85 winter.
Should our current solar cycle continue to follow the same course as Solar Cycle 12, then we may have an indicator for the upcoming 3 winters. Using the winters of solar Cycle 12, we see that the next three winters correspond to the winters of 1885/86, 1886/87, 1887/88 (marked yellow in the above chart). They were all colder than normal, which tells us that this coming 2015/16 winter and the 2 winters to follow are also likely to turn out to be colder than normal.
Here we are purely using the similarities solar cycle to previous cycles indicate what the future might hold. Naturally there are many other factors at play. For example did the 1885/86 winter see a strong El Nino and a cold North Atlantic like we are seeing this year?
Of course using only solar cycle similarities is a dubious way to make a seasonal forecast. But on the other hand when 7 out of 8 years correspond to each other, it’s certainly something to keep in the back of your mind. So far the coming UK winter is shaping up to be right on course with Cycle no. 12. We’ll know in a few months time.

You can also look at this map showing the cold centered over Germany. Right now warming is on nobody’s mind, and this current fall is exactly the kind people have seen generations earlier. The German climate has been hardly different than it was 30, or 60 years ago. The country is still getting its snow in the winter and frosts in the fall and spring despite the earlier predictions these events would be rare.

Speaking of snow, it’s forecast to hit in Germany’s central hilly region later this week. According to WetterKonor here (my emphasis):

On Wednesady it will rain along the coast and over the course of the day a little bit over the far west. From Thuringia and Saxony rain showers will extend out to the northeast. Foremost in the low mountains there will be sleet and snow showers as well. Only in the south will it remain mostly dry, with a mx of sun and clouds. Weak to moderate winds will blow mostly from the northeast.
By the end of the week rain clouds will stretch over Thuringia and Saxony and to the south. There will be local sleet and snow showers in the bag.”

Dr. Ryan Maue at Twitter here presents a chart showing where the snow is most likely to fall in Germany on Wedenesday.

Austria looks to be hit by heavy snow, with some areas forecast to get a foot. One reader asked if such snow events are unusual for this time of the year. The answer depends on weather you are a skeptic or a global warming alarmist. For skeptics this is perfectly normal and is the sort of thing seen over the past 100 years – it’s weather as usual. For alarmists on the other hand, well, they said these events would be rare – even in mid winter. Snow is what we call for alarmists “inconvenient events”.
Is this the start of a brutal and protracted winter?
A number of forecasters have warned that the NAO has flipped, and thus will result in cold air dipping across the continent and bringing a bitter cold winter. Whether that pattern holds, however, is unknown. It could just let up and we could wind up with a mild winter.
But so far things are not starting off well. Already I’m sipping on a cinnamon tea of the kind popular around Christmas.

A photo published at the online www.shz.de/lokal vividly illustrates how the green energy movement has nothing to do with protecting the environment and restoring nature to how it was before industrialization began some 200 years ago. Ironically it is profoundly blighting it.
The photo in a commentary by Gernot Kühl shows a landscape near the north German town of Dagebüll (close to Eckernförde) which has been literally obliterated by industrial wind turbines which, according to the report, has made the place “uninhabitable”. Photographer and artist Heinz Teufel comments:
The pictured landscape has officially been declared no longer inhabitable.”
Moreover Kühl writes:
Anyone travelling the vast land behind the dikes and anyone searching for the endless horizon of the Wattenmeer will ask in a state of shock: Has everyone gone mad? Natural beauty and cultural landscapes have mutated into industrial complexes, chaotically blighted with an arsenal of wind turbines.  […] Landscapes that are thousands of years old have been aesthetically and ecologically completely destroyed.”
Europe is not the only place that has managed to fully ruin its environment with its “nature protection” programs. A reader just sent me a photo from Aruba. Here’s how this paradise looks today now that environmentalists have implemented their nature protection measures:

Wind turbines blight Aruba’s horizon (click to enlarge). Photo taken by Christine L.

The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) here shows currently Arctic sea ice is at its highest level in years for this time of the year. Hat-tip: Kirye at Twitter.

Sea ice extent in recent years (in million km2) for the northern hemisphere, as a function of date.
In fact it appears it has reached its highest level ever over the last decade, and its only mid February. The DMI ice extent values are calculated from the data from the Ocean and Sea Ice, Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF), where areas with ice concentration higher than 30% are classified as ice, the site reports.
On the other hand, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) here reports that January, 2016, saw the lowest Arctic sea ice extent (15%) on the satellite record. Other sources depicting 15% sea ice concentration extent also show similar low values.
The overall trend, however, shows nothing alarming. The following chart from the Cryosphere Today of the Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois shows Arctic sea ice remaining flat over the past decade.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Paul Dorian at Vencoreweather.com here has a post on the latest concerning El Nino and global sea ice. Not long ago the warmists and alarmists were jumping and hollering about the drop in Arctic sea ice, accompanied by talk (hope) of an ice-free Arctic.
Arctic sea ice rebounds
Looks like all the talk was premature hysteria, as Arctic sea ice has moved back into a normal range. So rapidly can things up there change. It goes to show that natural factors do rule, and that a few tenths of a degree of global warming is nothing but a circus show. Vencoreweather writes:
Concerning the El Nino, ‘it has begun to collapse and will likely flip to a moderate or strong La Nina (colder-than-normal water) by later this year. In rather quick fashion, global temperatures have seemingly responded to the unfolding collapse of El Nino and global sea ice has actually rebounded in recent weeks to near normal levels.”
He adds: “…in recent weeks global sea ice has surged back to near normal as the collapse of El Nino has unfolded.”
Global surface temperatures fall as La Nino wanes
Of course sea ice does not react directly to ENSO changes, and certainly the recent sea ice surge had much more to do with local polar weather conditions. On the other hand, global temperature is in part modulated by the ENSO as the following chart indicates:

The chart above shows that global temperatures have eased back from their high earlier this year.

Arctic ice volume trending sharply upwards over past 5 years
Vencoreweather also presents a chart showing that Arctic sea ice volume trend has remained flat over the past decade, and it has actually been recovering over the past 5 years. All the talk of a death spiral are misplaced, to put it nicely.

Dorian writes that the University of Washington’s Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) “is showing an upward trend in Arctic sea ice volume since the low point was reached in 2012 following a long downtrend (circled area above)“.
Also Dorian points out that Antarctic sea ice has rebounded and is now above the mean. Overall Antarctic sea ice has been trending upwards since satellite measurements began.
Robust La Nina now in the works
Today Joe Bastardi posted at FaceBook a new chart issued by NOAA, writing: “CFSV2 continues to correct toward SCRIPPS with newest members (blue) now going to strong La Nina territory.

This latest “correction is rather amusing as just weeks ago NOAA predicted that there would not even be a La Nina. perhaps the NOAA allowed itself to become engulfed by all the warming hysteria, before having to scramble to avoid total forecast humiliation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s centre-left online weekly Die Zeit here presents an interview with a DWD German meteorologist concerning the late December warmth that hit the North Pole, an event that saw global warming activists and alarmists hollering it was evidence of manmade climate change.
Surprisingly the usually very alarmist Die Zeit gave a relatively balanced account from DWD meteorologist Andreas Friedrich in the interview. Alarm called off!
In late December North Atlantic storm “Frank” (In Germany dubbed “Eckard”) pumped a mass of warm air all the way up to the North Pole, sending the mercury there to the melting point for a day or so.
When Friedrich was asked if the event was unusual, he replied that the often ballyhooed temperature jump of 50°C was an exaggeration, and that the real temperature jump was closer to 30°C. The German meteorologist than stated that Atlantic storm Frank was extreme, but nothing that hasn’t been seen before already, explaining that its cause was a cold air mass clashing with a warm air mass near the surfsce.
When Die Zeit asked Friedrich whether the storm was connected to climate change, he replied (my emphasis):

The extreme low has nothing directly to do with climate change, which happens very slowly over very long time periods. Storm Frank happened coincidentally – an atmospheric fit. Such storms happen of course when air masses of very different temperatures clash. According to today’s climate models they will not become more frequent if the earth warms up on average. At most they may be more violent.”

Die Zeit persisted asking: “So extreme lows such as Frank that warm up the North Pole won’t be more frequent?”
Friedrich responded: “That would be pure speculation.”
So there we have it – directly from an expert meteorologist at the alarmist DWD itself, and reported by the alarmist Die Zeit. Of course temperature spikes at the North Pole are nothing new. They’ve happened many times before.

The above chart’s blue shows that it’s been too wet in Nigeria, and not too dry. Indeed there are number of scientific papers showing that the Sahara region has been getting greener over the past 30 years.
In the Middle East Bastardi shows that the drought has hit part of Turkey, but that most of Syria has had normal precipitation, and explains that “drought” is the normal climate condition there. At the 4:20 mark the Weatherbell meteorologist puts up a precipitation chart for the Middle East for the last five years:

The chart above shows more wet (blue) than dry (yellow/green) with Syria being completely normal. Joe shakes his head at how anyone could even make the claim that Kerry does:
What’s really interesting about all this is, this is just so easy to disprove. […] So I don’t understand why that was said.”
Most readers here do understand why. The falsehood was said because US foreign policy has been a total catastrophe in that region, and now Kerry is desperate for any excuse. And he couldn’t have picked a lamer one. In real life any company or employee blaming poor performance on climate change would be immediately shown the door. This is a blatant unwillingness to accept any responsibility.
The nonsense of climate change leading to terrorism excuse is so clear on so many fronts that it’s a wonder than anyone with even a few points of IQ would take it seriously.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome have been trying to whitewash history by claiming that fears of global cooling didn’t really exist back in the 1970s. Well, guest author Kenneth Richard shows that that was hardly the case at all. Fears of cooling were very real.
========================================
Scientists devised schemes to warm the climate in the 1960s-70s
By Kenneth Richard
During the 1960s and 1970s, there was widespread concern about a dramatically cooling climate, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.  For example, Starr and Oort (1973)1 determined there was -0.6°C of Northern Hemisphere cooling during the late 1950s to early 1960s alone. A throng of scientific papers were written about the observed global-scale cooling, a potentially imminent ice age, and how anthropogenic pollution may be contributing to the climate changes. The effects of CO2 were, at the time, thought to be less concerning. The paper below by Cimorelli and House (1974) was prototypical of the period.
Cimorelli and House, 1974:
Aside from such long-term changes, there is also evidence which indicates climate changes occurring in contemporary history.  Mitchell (1971) among others, claims that during the last century a systematic fluctuation of global climate is revealed by meteorological data. He states that between 1880 and 1940 a net warming of about 0.6°C occurred, and from 1940 to the present our globe experienced a net cooling of 0.3°C.
The effect of increasing global concentrations of CO2 is to increase the average global surface temperature. … As for increasing global concentrations of particulate matter, the opposite is true. Due to the backscattering characteristics of the particles an increase in the albedo occurs which produces a decrease in average global surface temperature. … Since it had been thought that the two effects canceled one another, their use as criteria for developing standards has not been considered. However, it has since been found that the rate of temperature increase decreases with increasing CO2 and increases with increasing particulates. Therefore, global particulate loading is of foremost concern. … Sellers (1973) has developed a climate model which quantitatively relates particulate loading to surface temperature. He has shown that an increase in man-made global particulates by a factor of 4.0 will initiate an ice-age. In order that we safeguard ourselves and future generations from a self-imposed ice-age it is necessary that we effectively monitor global concentrations of particulate matter. … Their results showed that an increase by a factor of eight of global CO2 concentrations will produce an increase in surface temperature of less than 2°C, whereas increasing particulate concentration by a factor of four could decrease the mean surface temperature as much as 3.5°C. Therefore, as the global concentrations of both CO2 and particulates are increased, it is the radiative shielding effect of the particulates which plays the dominate role. … Ludwig and Morgan, 1970, predict that man’s potential to pollute will increase six-to-eight fold in the next fifty years. All of these studies point to the possibility, in the not so distant future, of man polluting himself into an ice age.
It was during this same cooling period — which has since been curiously erased in modern-day temperature graphs — that scientists and engineers were devising “schemes” to warm the planet by, for example, intentionally melting Arctic sea ice, or by using dams to redirect warmer waters into cooler regions.  The paper below (Fletcher, 1969) summarized some of these “schemes” to warm the planet and prevent cooling.
Fletcher, 1969:
The post-glacial warming culminated in the “climatic optimum” of 4000-2000 BC, during which world temperatures were 2-3°C warmer than they are now …Since the “little ice age” of 1650-1840, which climaxed the cooling trend from about 1300, a new warming trend predominated which seems to have reached a climax in this century, followed by cooling since about 1940, at first irregularly but more sharply since about 1960.
SPECIFIC SCHEMES FOR CLIMATE MODIFICATION
Ice Free Arctic Ocean The largest scale enterprise that has been discussed is that of transforming the Arctic into an ice free ocean. As was noted earlier this has been most carefully studied by the staff of the Main Geophysical Observatory in Leningrad. … It is possible that the capacity of present technology may be sufficient to accomplish this task. but this has not been established. Three basic approaches have been proposed (Fletcher 1965): (1) influencing the surface reflectivity of the ice to cause more absorption of solar heat; (2) large scale modification of cloud conditions by seeding; (3) increasing the inflow of warm water from the Atlantic.
Bering Strait Dam Soviet engineer Borisov (1959, 1967) has been the most active proponent of the much publicized Bering Strait Dam. The basic idea is to increase the inflow of warm Atlantic water by stopping or oven reversing the present northward flow of colder water through Bering Strait. The dam would be 50 miles long and 150 feet high.
Deflecting the Kuroshio Current The Pacific Ocean counterpart of the Gulf Stream is the Kuroshio Current, a small branch of which enters the Sea of Japan and exits to the Pacific between the Japanese islands. It has been proposed that the narrow mouth of Tatarsk Strait be blocked by a giant “water valve” to increase the warm inflow to the Sea of Okhotsk and reduce the winter ice there.
Of course, today’s version of anthropogenic climate change alarmism insists that dangerous climate warming is predominantly caused by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Therefore, in contrast to the tendentious climate modification schemes proposed in the 1960s and 1970s, we are told we must make every policy attempt to cool the climate – or at least prevent more warming – by replacing fossil fuel energies and infrastructure with renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
And yet recent detailed analyses indicate that a calculated policy effort to significantly reduce CO2 emissions may be particularly inefficient and ultimately ineffective in preventing the projected dangerous warming. That’s because even if all the CO2 emissions reduction measures by agreeable nations were put into effect and adhered to through to the year 2100, the amount of reduced warming achieved would be less than -0.2°C over the next 85 years2, 3. Since the claims are that we may get 3.0°C and more of dangerous warming by 2100 even with these severe emissions reduction policies, a savings of just -0.2°C would not appear to be significant.
So what would be significant?
Consider the conclusions of Zhang and co-authors from a recently published (2016) paper (“The updated effective radiative forcing of major anthropogenic aerosols and their effects on global climate at present and in the future“). These scientists found that human aerosol emissions (“sulphate (SF), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC)”) cooled planetary surface temperatures by a massive -2.53 K between 1850 and 2010. In addition, the authors conclude that if we continue to reduce aerosol emissions (air pollution) at the rate we have been in recent decades, this will consequently lead to a warming of 2.06 K by 2100 – a warming not significantly different than projections due to business-as-usual increases in CO2 emissions.

Below are excerpts from the Zhang et al. (2016) abstract:
The effective radiative forcing (ERF), as newly defined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5), of three anthropogenic aerosols [sulphate (SF), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC)] and their comprehensive climatic effects were simulated and discussed, using the updated aerosol-climate online model of BCC_AGCM2.0.1_CUACE/Aero. From 1850 to 2010, the total ERF of these anthropogenic aerosols was −2.49 W m−2
From 1850 to 2010, anthropogenic aerosols brought about a decrease of ∼2.53 K and ∼0.20 mm day−1 in global annual mean surface temperature and precipitation, respectively. Surface cooling was most obvious over mid- and high latitudes in the northern hemisphere (NH). … Experiments based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 given in IPCC AR5 shows the dramatic decrease in three anthropogenic aerosols in 2100 will lead to an increase of ∼2.06 K and 0.16 mm day−1 in global annual mean surface temperature and precipitation, respectively, compared with those in 2010.
So if (a) anthropogenic aerosol pollution can reduce global temperatures by -2.53 K in 160 years with -2.49 W m-2 of forcing; (b) severe CO2 emissions cuts may only reduce surface temperatures by a modest -0.2° C in the next 85 years; and (c) 2.06 K of warming may occur if further cuts in aerosol pollution continue to accrue at the same pace of recent decades, this begs the question: Why are climate policies centered around reducing CO2 emissions instead of on the strategic management of aerosol emissions? Considering its alleged forcing strength or potential to induce warming and/or cooling, increasing or decreasing aerosol pollution would ostensibly be far more effective and efficient at modifying the climate than attempting to geoengineer our way to an optimum temperature with CO2 emissions policies.
Even more problematic for the dangerous CO2-induced global warming paradigm constructed in the last few decades is that an anthropogenic aerosol-forced -2.49 W m-2 cooling of -2.53 K between 1850 and 2010 would necessarily eliminate the capacity for anthropogenic CO2 forcing to have been the cause of the overall warming trend of about 0.8°C between 1850 and 2010.  After all, “basic physics” tells us – and even the IPCC and blogs like Skeptical Science agree – that even if we were to double the pre-industrial levels of CO2 concentration from 280 ppm to 560 ppm (without feedbacks), the associated radiative forcing would amount to about 4 W m-2 , and this forcing would lead to a modest 1.2°C of warming 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
According to the IPCC (2013, Summary for Policy Makers), the accumulated anthropogenic CO2 radiative forcing (RF) was only about +1.8 W m-2 in total for the entire 1750-2011 period10 — a value considerably lower than the alleged -2.49 W m-2 of negative anthropogenic forcing (cooling) indicated by Zhang et al. (2016) for 1850-2010 due to aerosol emissions.   In other words, the presumed heat forcing from CO2 would not have been strong enough to overcome the radiative heat losses associated with anthropogenic aerosol forcing. The alleged anthropogenic influence on climate would necessarily have been one of net cooling, not warming, for the past few hundred years, and therefore the ~0.8°C of net warming since 1850 would have to have been forced by factors other than anthropogenic CO2. This would obviously be incompatible with the dangerous CO2-induced global warming paradigm that exists today.
A few years ago, a paper published in Environmental Research Letters (McClellan et al. [2012], http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/3/034019/pdf/1748-9326_7_3_034019.pdf) summarized the costs of geoengineering a cooler climate via stratospheric albedo modification. Specifically discussed was a proposal to pump millions of tons of sulfuric acid into the high atmosphere with a 20-kilometer pipe (which would presumably block sunlight and lead to surface cooling). About 45 years ago, an albedo modification scheme designed to warm the planet by melting Arctic sea ice was likewise assessed for feasibility. Considering the presumably much higher radiative forcing impact of artificially blocking more or less of the sun’s energy from reaching the surface (albedo modification), these “schemes” may actually not be quite as strange or outlandish as they might first appear. Especially if we compare the effectiveness and efficiency of “schemes” like this to that of CO2 emissions reduction policies, which have been shown to have even less of an effect on climate.

In other words, the radiative forcing corresponding to a doubling of the CO2 concentration would be 4 Wm-2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe data on this year’s meteorological summer (June-July-August) are coming in and they tell us trouble is brewing at the high latitudes. I reported here on this earlier.
The Irish warming famine
First, fresh data from Ireland show that the country had one of the coldest summers in living memory, despite near average sunshine. The Irish News here reports:
Armagh Observatory, which has been recording the weather in the city since 1795, found that June, July and August had an average temperature of just over 14 degrees – slightly colder than the bad summers of 2011 and 1993 and the coldest since 1986.”
So what’s going on? We see using NOAA data how northern Quebec, Greenland, the North Atlantic, Britain, Scandinavia and across a vast part of Northern Russia temperatures were markedly cooler than normal this past summer:

NCEP/NCAR reanalysis shows frigid summer conditions across the north. Hat-tip: Wobleibt. Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov
Cold Atlantic with coming La Nina bode ill
The rapidly cooling North Atlantic  and a large switch f the Arctic bodes very ill for the globe, especially in view of the fact that it will combine with the expected upcoming La Nina on the heels of the current El Nino, and therefore we may see global temperatures plummeting by up to half a degree in a about 2 years time.

Another ominous sign is Greenland has seen its massive ice sheet grow by 220 km³. This is enough to cover the entire country of Spain with half a meter of ice.
Warmists panicking?
Already forecasts of horror-winters are appearing for northern Europe, and they will come true should the mass of cold stick around. Caution with such forecasts are advised, of course.
The overall North Atlantic cooling development already appears to have some warmists in a state of panic, and so it’s no surprise we are now seeing highly dubious studies insisting that the warming is causing the cooling.
Canary in coal mine Arctic stops cooperating…
Thanks to the oceanic ENSO cycles this year globally as a whole the planet has been warmer than normal. However the equatorial regions of the globe are not really the locations that alarmists customarily showcase as the ones to watch, especially in view of the fact that weather balloons have failed to show any warming up in the lower troposphere, precisely where the theory claims this is where you’d expect it.
Both poles no longer cooperating
Over the better part of the last decade the warmists liked using the high latitude Arctic regions as the “canary in the coal mine”. They also used to showcase Antarctica as well, but the South Pole stopped cooperating with melting scenarios years ago, and now so has the Arctic stopped cooperating.
Scientists are now acknowledging that a return of Arctic sea ice is entirely possible. There’s real trouble brewing for the warmists.

The high carb, low-fat science is crumbling with ever accelerating speed and in spectacular fashion. And because climate science was established in the very same way, it too will crumble just as spectacularly.
Ancel Keys = Michael Mann
7-Country Chart = Hockey Stick Chart
Fat = CO2
John Yudkin = Richard Lindzen
US Dietary Guidelines = IPCC
Nina Teicholz = Vincent Gray
Also high carb science is chock full with smears, appeals to consensus, arrogance, vicious attacks, data cherry-picking, politicization, peer-review corruption, fraud, obstinance, naïve simplicity, one-sided funding etc. which we’ve all have come to know so well in climate science.
Outstanding essay on how junk science survived 50 years
Just substitute the above in Ian Leslie’s outstanding “The Sugar Conspiracy” and you will see exactly what will happen to CO2 climate science. It’s going to take another one, maybe two decades. It’s a long read, but worth every word and minute.
And as you will see CO2 climate science is an exact carbon copy of the dietary fat scandal and will certainly suffer the same fate.
Some excerpts:

The 2015 edition of the US Dietary Guidelines (they are revised every five years) makes no reference to any of this new research, because the scientists who advised the committee – the most eminent and well-connected nutritionists in the country – neglected to include a discussion of it in their report. It is a gaping omission, inexplicable in scientific terms, but entirely explicable in terms of the politics of nutrition science. If you are seeking to protect your authority, why draw attention to evidence that seems to contradict the assertions on which that authority is founded? Allow a thread like that to be pulled, and a great unravelling might begin.”
On how science progresses:
In a 2015 paper titled Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?, a team of scholars at the National Bureau of Economic Research sought an empirical basis for a remark made by the physicist Max Planck: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”
The researchers identified more than 12,000 “elite” scientists from different fields. […] Searching obituaries, the team found 452 who had died before retirement. They then looked to see what happened to the fields from which these celebrated scientists had unexpectedly departed, by analysing publishing patterns.
What they found confirmed the truth of Planck’s maxim. Junior researchers who had worked closely with the elite scientists, authoring papers with them, published less. At the same time, there was a marked increase in papers by newcomers to the field, who were less likely to cite the work of the deceased eminence. The articles by these newcomers were substantive and influential, attracting a high number of citations. They moved the whole field along.”
On the Internet as an information source:
One of the scientists who called for the retraction of Nina Teicholz’s BMJ article, who requested that our conversation be off the record, complained that the rise of social media has created a “problem of authority” for nutrition science. “Any voice, however mad, can gain ground,” he told me. […]
But in areas where experts have a track record of getting it wrong, it is hard to see how it could be worse. If ever there was a case that an information democracy, even a very messy one, is preferable to an information oligarchy, then the history of nutrition advice is it.”
And rest assured, climate science will show the same.

Not long ago he supplied a list of 250 papers published in 2015 casting doubt on the consensus climate science, read here. Many of them confirm that natural factors are the main drivers of climate change.
Shortly after that he supplied a list of 50 similar papers appearing just in the first two months of this year alone. See here.
248 papers in 2014
Today he provides a compilation of 248 papers from 2014 that casts huge doubt on the allegedly “consensus-backed” climate science. In total we have now seen over 500 papers over the past 2 years contesting much of what the UN IPCC has been preaching.
Moreover Kenneth Richards writes in an e-mail that he has found another 12 papers to add to the 2015 list of 250 we mentioned earlier, bringing that total to about 260. He informs me that he is going to take the time to compile a list for 2013.
70 papers already this year alone
Finally he notes that the list for 2016 has already reached 70 in number.

Bavaria’s highest constitutional court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) has just upheld the southern German state’s hotly contested 10 H wind turbine permitting rule which has been in effect since February 2014.
The Court ruled that the requirement is indeed constitutional. Full story here.

The ruling represents a major landmark victory for wind energy opponents, who have been increasingly shocked by the rampant destruction of Germany’s countryside and natural landscape. They greeted the ruling with loud cheers.
Major setback for Big Wind
The Court’s decision marks a huge setback for the German wind industry, climate protection activists, and for the Germany’s once highly touted Energiewende as a whole.
The Bavaraian Green party reacted angrily to the Court’s ruling. According to BR24 leading Green Party official Eike Hallitzky tweeted:
10H remains amok energy policy. Us Greens are going to continue fighting for climate protection. With all our might!”
Wind turbine proponents were hoping to erect up to 4000 wind turbines in Bavaria, one of the country’s most fabled and idyllic regions and home to world renowned sights such as the Neuschwanstein Castle (see above).
The Court’s ruling sends a crystal clear message to the rest of the country, and to Europe: People have had it with watching their landscape being ruined today in order to maybe theoretically protect the climate of the year 2100.

After more than 2 years of legal battling, the Bavarian high court’s ruling was awaited with uncharacteristically high suspense from both proponents and opponents of wind energy. Wind energy supporters insisted the 10 H regulation violated the law.
Over the past months wind projects across Germany have been met with increasingly fierce opposition.
Under the 10 H rule, wind parks can be installed only if they have a minimum distance that is ten times the turbine’s height away from residential homes. That means a 200-meter tall turbine needs to be at least 2 kilometers away from the nearest residential area before it can be approved.
In Bavaria that would make the construction of most wind park projects virtually impossible.
German public broadcasting SAT1 BAYERN here wrote yesterday:
The opponents are not in any way old nuclear power protesters. Among the environmentalists there is bitter discourse, as the price for clean wind energy is the total industrialization of the landscape. […] . In densely populated Germany, open views of natural scenery are becoming rare. For this reason some CSU parliamentarians in the state parliament find the love for wind parks by the Greens rather peculiar.”
Germany has some 26,000 turbines in operation producing some 85 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually – which is less than the country’s remaining 8 nuclear power plants. SAT1 writes that wind turbines “are also no efficient form of energy generation, as a glance at the power business shows.”
SAT1 adds that without subsidies, most turbines would not even turn a profit.
In total Germany already pays out about 25 billion euros annually in subsidies for green energy. Nevertheless CO2 emissions have not dropped in 7 years. In other words: well over 100 billion euros have bought nothing.
SAT1 concludes on wind energy in Bavaria:
Clean energy supply with today’s technology is incompatible with the landscape that took 2000 years to form.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Nobel Peace Prize Committee is (in)famous for its controversial choices when selecting the winner of the prestigious prize. Many among us recall how the Oslo-based Committee once awarded the Prize to PLO leader and terrorist Yasser Arafat.
“One Peace Prize winner bombs another”
Today German online flagship daily ‘Die Welt’ presents an article about the worst choices made by the Committee. For example mong them they select US President Barack Obama, who was given the award in 2009. Die Welt writes:
“…when one Nobel Peace Prize laureate (Barack Obama, 2009) bombs another (Doctors Without Borders, 1999) in Afghanistan, thus killing dozens of people, then doubt is warranted over whether the Prize really delivers what it promises.”
Surely one has to wonder if amid the Middle East chaos Obama has really acted in the Prize’s original spirit: “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”
Die Welt presents its list of laureates to whom they feel the award was a blunder. Here are the top 5:
1. Henry Kissinger
 2. Yasser Arafat
 3. Al Gore and Rajendra Pachauri
4. Wangari Maathai
5. Barack Obama

Gore and Pachauri come in third. Die Welt writes that the selection of former vice president Gore had little to do with promoting ‘fraternity among nations’. Moreover the Die Welt adds:
Since then Gore’s climate-political engagement has diminished markedly, as well as that of then IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri, who was sharply criticized because he used dubious data to promote doomsday scenarios such as predictions of the destruction of the Netherlands or the desertification of the Amazon rainforest.
Probably to avoid going over the top with its criticism, Die Welt remained diplomatic and elected not bring up the now disgraced former IPCC chairman Pachauri’s sexual harassment affair and crony green energy deals.
Also the once wildly popular Barack Obama has lost his shine in Europe. Die Welt placed the current US president at number 5 on the list of Worst Peace Prize decisions, and as the turmoil in the Middle East spirals and race-baited tensions simmer in the US, he may eventually reach the top of the list before his presidency ends.
Die Welt summarizes:
Looking at the decisions over the past years, one could get the impression that the Nobel Peace Prize has turned into one for democracy, environmental protection and women’s rights. No doubt these are honorable targets, but they are not in the spirit of Alfred Nobel. What is probably the greatest scandal in history of the Nobel Peace Prize is that Indian peace activist Mahatma Gandhi never received it.”
No surprise here. Unfortunately the committee in Oslo is all too often caught up in political correctness and flippant activism, and so do not make the right choices. Lately that has been all too frequent.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe legal winds are shifting! Many city councils and wind park planners are going to have to clean up their acts when pushing through their pet wind park projects.
Germany’s Fundamental Law specifically expresses that the State is obligated to protect the life and physical body of the individual, foremost from illegal attacks by others.
Consequently, according to German legal experts Prof. Michael Elicker and Andreas Langenbahn here, city councils approving the installation of wind parks may be held personally liable for damage to the health of persons who live close to them.
And when it comes to wind parks, even if only a certain part of the population are susceptible to the health hazards of infrasound (frequency below 20 Hz), it does not preclude the requirement being complied with. They write (my emphasis):
If the state (in this sense the term also includes the towns and communities) allows large wind parks to be constructed at a completely inadequate distance – at times only a few hundred meters – then it violates the state obligation to protect and may be held liable for the health consequences.
With this backdrop there are large risks also for communities and their participants if during the planning of so-called “wind-park priority areas” they willingly follow along with the ‘considerations of the contracted planning companies, of whom most of them belong to – and the term is indeed appropriate – the ecological-industrial complex.”
In Germany this puts city councils who onesidedly base their decisions to build wind parks on dubious planning/approval processes and feasibility studies squarely in the legal line of fire.

Too often windpark approvals are fraught with conflicts of interest and crony deals. Finally in Germany the spotlight is getting aimed at the dark underside of the renewable energy industry and their tactics used in ramming projects through against the will of the people.
Also city councils and wind park planers are finding it increasingly difficult to dismiss infrasound produced by wind turbines by claiming that “it cannot be proven scientifically”.
Experts Elicker and Langenbahn calls claims there is no scientific evidence supporting the health hazards of infrasound “false” and that the State is in any case obligated to protect life and body of persons not only after a hazard is conclusively proven.
The authors of the report write that it is extremely difficult to dampen the very low frequency infrasound and that it can travel for kilometers, noting that contrary to wide-spread belief, the frequency is audible, and that it is perceived as pulsations and vibrations.
Even Germany’s Ministry of Environment writes, summing the results of investigations and contradicting earlier claims, that starting at a certain acoustic level, infrasound can have a variety of negative effects on the human body and can interfere with the cardio-vascular system, adversely effect concentration, reaction time, balance and the nervous system. Victims often complain of dizziness.
Elicker and Langenbahn believe that many councilmen and planners have been too careless in their dismissal of infrasound when planning their wind parks. They write that this could all lead to a “rude awakening” for those involved in the slipshod approval of wind parks, and warn they may even be personally liable with their own private assets.
High time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNote: Sticky post for one more day…
=====================================
The online Spiegel has an article that really drives home the energy hardship that German consumers are suffering, “due to the rising costs of electricity“, brought on by the country’s hasty rush into green energies.

Hundreds of thousands of Germans struggling today without electricity. Image cropped from here.
It is not only Germany’s power companies who are bleeding to death financially, but so are many private citizens, who are unable to pay for their power. A shocking situation in one of the world’s most technically advanced nations.
According to the German flagship news magazine, citing the federal Bundesnetzagentur (German Network Agency), more than 350,000 households saw their power get switched off in 2014. Spiegel blames the “Energiewende” (transition to renewable energy), writing in its sub-title:
The social problems of the Energiewende are growing: Last year more households than ever saw their power get switched off. The reason is the rising price of electricity.”

Spiegel also provides the figures for the previous years, and they too are horrific. In 2013 close 345,000 households lost their power, and in 2012 it was about 320,000. Over the past three years it all totals to be a whopping 1.025 million households!
In a country of 82 million, the figures are socially explosive.
Threatened 6.3 million times
It’s a glaring paradox of the Energiewende: On the production side, power plants are losing billions of euros because they can no longer even get a modest price for their power, while on the consumer side more and more households are unable to afford the skyrocketing prices brought on by the mandatory infusion of expensive and unstable green energies into the German power grid. The once mighty German power grid now teeters on the brink of crumbling.
The situation threatens to get far worse. Spiegel writes that “far more households have problems with their electric bills. According to the Bundesnetzagentur power utilities threatened their customers with power cut-offs 6.3 million times.”
Spiegel writes that the price of electricity in Germany has doubled since 2002 in large part because of the renewable energy feed-in surcharge. Private households are the hardest hit; they have to pay some 45% more than the EU average (while German power producers get 30% less than the EU average)! The government-interfered market is grotesquely distorted.
Spiegel reports that even more costs are on the way for 2016 with the average household expected to pay on average 40 euros per year more.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSchneefan (snow fan) at German climate science critical site wobleibtdieerderwaemung.de here presents the latest analysis of the current ENSO, which shows a powerful La Niña in the works.
Three-Year Super La Niña with Global Cooling? – April 2016 ENSO Update 
Based on an array of data, Schneefan tells readers to expect a La Niña already early in the second half of this year and that there are signs it may turn into a Super La Nina – one that could persist until part way into 2018.
The consequence, he writes: “With a delay of 4 to 5 months, global temperatures will retreat over many years and fall below the long-term climate mean.”
From earlier ENSO models, the La Niña originally was not very evident, but the NOAA has since drastically corrected its projections and the CFSv2 is now anticipating “unusual cold sea surface temperatures in the El Niño region of 3.4,” the climate science critical site writes.

Plot of projected equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies, region 3.4, from April 15, 2016. La Niña values of -0.5 K are expected already in June. Many models are projecting the -2.0°K level to be surpassed. Source: www.ncep.noaa.gov/products/html.
Schneefan reports that the latest models are now projecting “a powerfully cold La Niña is on the way” – one that could smash the earlier record set back by the La Niña of the 1970s.
The current CFSv2 projections are now pretty much in line with most of the other ENSO models, and foresees already La Niña conditions with an average of -0.9°K SSTA in August:

Source: www.bom.gov.au/climate/model-summary/Pacific-Ocean
Schneefan also provides the numerical table from the NOAA showing past historical events since 1950:

Source: Historical El Nino/ La Nina episodes (1950-present)
The figures in the table above, Schneefan writes, are actually the “falsified” ones. The coldest La Niñas occurred in 1998-2001 (-1.6°K) and in 1973 (-1.9° K). The latest projections for the coming La Niña show these may even be surpassed.

Also the energy content of the equatorial water mass down to 300 meters below the surface dipped into negative territory by mid April, reaching an anomaly of -0.7°K, thus already in the La Niña range.

The chart above shows: El Niño going – La Niña coming! Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/shtml
 
The next chart is a poignant display of just how powerful the oncoming La Niña is threatening to be. The chart shows the cross section of the Pacific equatorial water down to 400 meters since January 2016:

Strengthening of the Humboldt currents. The warm El Niño water has practically fully disappeared! Source: 4-month sequence of Pacific Ocean equatorial temperature anomaly cross sections.
The complex, coupled ocean/atmosphere index MEI (Multivariate ENSO Index) also is pointing downward (see chart below) and will rapidly fall below zero in the months ahead, just as was the case for the super 1997/98 El Niño, but this time it’ll be earlier, Schneefan tells us:

Source: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/
More bad news of coming cold
Schneefan also writes that the upcoming La Niña will also coincide with a dying solar sunspot cycle, one that was a weak one to start with, and the fact that the earth is now moving further away from the sun in its orbit,. This will only make the cooling worse. He summarizes:
Thus so could the coming 2016/17 winter be as exciting as the 2010/11 winter: The Super La Nina and the Coming Winter.

===================================
Chainsaws rip birdlife protection
The German Wildlife Foundation sees an increase in criminal activity in the construction of wind parks


Bird killed by wind turbine. Photo: German Wildlife Foundation
As delegates congregated in Paris, chainsaws were busily cutting down forests in Germany to make way for wind turbines. Protected trees which are homes to bird-life were being illegally cut down and birds killed.
Research by the German Wildlife Foundation, the Nature Protection Alliance (NABU) and the Committee Against Killing Birds have confirmed such criminal acts. So far at least 40 cases of illegal devastations to large birds within the scope of planned wind parks have been registered. In most cases the nests were destroyed or the trees cut down. At least in one case young birds were struck dead. The most common victim by far is the Red Kite. But also the extremely rare Lesser Spotted Eagle saw nests destroyed.
“These are not just random acts of recklessness by young rowdies, but rather criminal acts against protected species which can be punished with up to five years imprisonment,” says Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, sole Chairman of the German Wildlife Federation. “The killing and destruction of nests represent a whole new dimension in the endangerment of species by wind park facilities,” says Prof. Vahrenholt. “Biodiversity and species protection are being callously sacrificed under the guise of wind energy and climate protection.”

Unscrupulous green energy dealmakers
Such criminal acts have been registered in 10 German states already and scrupulous green energy dealmakers are doing it with chainsaws. The current minimum distance regulations in most cases would forbid the construction of wind power facilities. But the value of property on which a wind park is built increases enormously in value overnight with the use of chainsaws: For each wind turbine the property owner can expect to earn €1.6 million in leasing fees – i.e. € 80,000 per year, for 20 years.
The research results presented by the environmentalists shows a frightening trend: Two years ago two cases were reported, in 2014 there were ten cases, and this year through November there have been 19 cases of nest destruction and bird killing nationwide. In addition to the Red Kites and the Lesser Spotted Eagle, also other species such as sea eagles, black storches, tree hawks and bats have been impacted.
Charges have been lodged in all cases. The German Wildlife Foundation anticipates more charges over the coming months because trees are cut down mostly during the winter months. “Also the construction of wind energy continues unhindered, and for this reason we fear a new wave of nest destruction,” says Prof. Vahrenholt. The German Wildlife Foundation reiterates its demand for a moratorium on wind turbines in forests.
Anyone who witnesses such an incident is asked to document it, press charges and to inform the Wildlife Foundation. More here

The treaty is useless, vaguely binding and will not have any impact whatsoever. In a few days we will start hearing a chorus of dissatisfaction from reductions proponents about the treaty’s ineffectiveness.

Here’s the new “Historical Draft“, which soon will up for signing into international law.
Skimming it, at first glance, the draft appears watered down. On the temperature target:

It’s going to take some time to digest/read through the content. By then it’ll likely either be ratified, or discarded.
Reading it I couldn’t help but think this is a document of madness. Global temperature cannot be regulated. It’s delusional to think so.
Unless you’re going to make money from it, why would anyone want to sign it and ensure a place in history’s Laughing Stock Hall of Fame? The passage that sparked this thought clearly shows the levels human delusion can reach, Article 2, Paragraph 1, part (a):

Signatories to this treaty will go down as historical fools who let themselves get caught up in hysteria.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
It’s the end of the year tally at the DWD German Weather Service for 2015. In a press release the DWD reported on December 30, 2015:

2015 second warmest year in Germany – tied with 2000 and 2007
2015 in Germany saw a mean temperature of 9.9°C, thus – after the preliminary analysis of measurements taken from some 2000 surface stations belonging to the DWD – it is the second warmest year on record since measurements began in 1881, tied with 2000 and 2007. The temperature record of 2014 stands by a wide margin at 10.3°C. Moreover the past 12 months were also drier and sunnier than normal, the DWD reports.
In 2015, 10 of 12 months were warmer than normal. Only September and October came in below the multi-year mean. August was the second warmest and November and December were even the record warmest ever since 1881. In July and August extreme heat dominated Germany, and the Franconian town of Kitzingen measured 40.3 °C , setting a new Germany record high.”

What a disappointment. We were already looking forward to a new annual record – and then came the blow. Only the silver medal, and that shared with two other years. Theoretically 2015 got only one third of a silver medal.
Back on September 21, 2015, German public television ntv held out hope:
According to scientists 2015 could be the warmest year on record worldwide since measurements began 135 years ago. Also Germany could break a record. So far in the country 2014 has been the warmest, said the chairperson of the German meteorological Society (DMG), Gudrun Rosenhagen at the 10th German Climate Conference in Hamburg. And this year is well on the way to break the record.”
What a pity, Frau Rosenhagen. By the way we are still waiting for an answer to our question sent to the DMG (see “Answer requested: Is the solar trend in the statement released by the German Meteorological Society correct?“). In its press release the DWD claims that in 2015 ten of twelve months were warmer than the mean. We assume this is in comparison to the now obsolete and ancient 1961 to 1990 reference period. When using the more up-to-date 1981 to 2010 reference period, the number of warmer than normal months likely drops.
It also remains a mystery how Germany’s year 2000 managed to reach 2nd place. It was a rained out summer and public swimming pools saw very few swimmers. [The following video shows ARD television asking whatever had happened to the summer amid cold rainy weather]:

Thanks to Klima Manifest Heiligenroth
The DWD forgets to mention that over the past 15 years there has been no warming whatsoever. What follows are a number monthly mean temperature plots going back over the recent past. For whatever reason, what the DWD refuses to make public, is made public thanks to Josef Kowatsch. What follows are three examples of the development of monthly mean temperatures in Germany – based on the DWD’s own original data.
February Germany temperature plot since 1988:

July Germany mean temperature plot since 2000:

October mean temperature plot, last 16 years:

No global record
Also the global temperature failed to set a new record in 2015. The UAH measured figures show an extended global temperature pause. 2015 came in only in third place, as NASA satellite expert Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama in Huntsville documents here.
This makes 2015 the third warmest year globally (+0.27°C) in the satellite record (since 1979), well behind 1998 (+0.48 deg C) and 2010 (+0.34 deg. C).
That’s quite lousy for an El Niño year, which in mid 2015 the year was regarded as a candidate for a world record. Somehow the wind behind 2015 must have disappeared in the second half.

Temperature trend as to satellite measurements. Figure: Roy Spencer, UAH.
Moreover surface station datasets GISS and HadCRUT are in crisis. Over the past years they have interfered multiple times with the datasets and carried out a number of highly dubious corrections that make little sense. The data are now highly questionable, and alleged records are suspicious. Here there has to be and there will be consequences.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s a good time to take a look at how global sea ice is doing at both poles. We were told over and over that the poles are the canary in the coal mine for global warming.
If the sea ice melt trend accelerated, we were warned, then the planet was warming rapidly and societies would be wise to prepare quickly for long-term sea level rise.
But nothing has happened at the poles so far.
Like everything related to climate and weather, there’s a lot of volatility built into the infinitely complex system, and so short term changes should not be viewed hysterically.
It is important to keep the focus on the long term and to keep a rational head. When that is done, then we quickly see that there is nothing to worry about and that all the climate indicators are all well within the normal range of natural variability.
The following chart shows Arctic sea ice coverage anomaly from the mean since satellite measurements began in 1978:

The above chart, from arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere, shows that the Arctic sea ice was in fact quite stable from 1979 to 2002, trending downward only slightly. Then from 2002 to 2007, a period of only 5 years, the sea ice saw almost all of its melting. Over the past 10 years, however, the Arctic sea ice has been stable, even growing some over the past 6 years.
Indeed a number of scientists are projecting the Arctic sea ice to recover as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) enters its negative mode of its typical 50-60 year cycle.
It needs to be pointed out that 35 years is a short period when attempting to derive long term sea ice trends. Let us recall it is known that the Arctic sea ice coverage moves in multidecadal cycles, impacted heavily by natural oceanic cycles.
In the 1950s photos of an ice-free north pole are famous. Old newspaper clippings from the early 20th century quoted scientists who reported “dramatic melting” in the Arctic.

Antarctic accelerating sea ice growth trend
The South Pole has been a real embarrassment for the global warming alarmists who earlier predicted a meltdown. That too has not happened. Instead the Antarctic trend has gone in the totally opposite direction:

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere
The above chart shows that Antarctic sea ice cover has in fact been accelerating upwards. Over the past several months the sea ice has fallen from its record high levels and is now dead normal – for the first time in more than 3 years!
Looking at both north and south polar sea ice combined, using data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, we see absolutely nothing to worry about:

Everything is completely normal and there is no reason to let yourself go into fits of hysteria.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDave Burton of  SeaLevel.info site here deserves widespread, world-wide exposure.
Hat-tip: Kenneth Richard
The site allows user-friendly observation of sea level rise trends at locations across the world using spreadsheet data direct from NOAA and PSMSL, as it is designed to be similar to Paul Clark’s popular interactive temperature graph site (woodfortrees.org).
Sea levels rising less than half as fast, no acceleration!
Stunningly, contrary to the claims of the modeled reconstructions of sea level rise (with “adjustments” added), actual physical measurements indicate that sea levels are rising at rates well less than half the claimed rates when including GIA “adjustments” and satellite altimetry modeled reconstructions.
The best estimate is a median global mean sea level value of 1.48 mm/yr, or less than 6 inches per century.
SeaLevel.info is a one-stop source for sea-level information. The spreadsheets consolidate data from NOAA, PSMSL and other sources, to simplify examination of tide-gauge data for long term sea-level trend analysis.
The site writes:
One interesting observation is that GIA (PGR)† adjustments are often nearly as large as the averaged actual measured sea-level trends! The average of the measured trends for NOAA’s 2012 set of 239 tide gauges is 1.017 mm/year (median 1.280), but the GIA adjustments add an average of 0.665 mm/year, giving a total “adjusted” average trend of 1.682 mm/year, which rounds to 1.7 mm/year, which happens to exactly equal a very widely-quoted figure for 20th century sea-level rise.”
The site here also writes that sea level is not rising everywhere, and:

The measured rate of coastal sea-level change varies from -17.59 mm/yr at Skagway, Alaska to +9.39 mm/yr at Kushiro, Japan. The average, as measured by the world’s best long-term coastal tide gauges, is just under +1.5 mm/yr (about 6 inches per century).”
Satellite altimetry
SeaLevel.info wonders about the often ballyhooed figures of 3.3 mm/yr (13 inches per century), based on satellite altimetry measurements of sea-level, rather than coastal sea-level measured by tide gauges. It writes that satellite altimeters “measure the wrong thing”:
Their measurements are distorted by “sea-level rise” caused by thermal expansion when the upper layer of the ocean warms. But that is a strictly local effect, that doesn’t affect the quantity of water in the oceans, and doesn’t affect sea-level elsewhere (e.g., at the coasts).  Sea-level rise only matters at the coasts, but satellite altimeters are incapable of measuring sea-level at the coasts. They can only measure sea-level in the open ocean. Tide gauges measure sea-level at the coasts, where it matters. Also, tide gauge measurements of sea-level are much higher quality than satellite altimetry measurements.
SealLevel.info adds that “satellite measurements of sea-level are of questionable reliability, and vary considerably from one satellite to another” and that tide gauges are more reliable because “some of the tide-gauge records of sea-level measurements are nearly ten times as long as the combined satellite measurement record, and twenty times as long as any single satellite measurement record.”
According to SeaLevel.info, the NOAA has done linear regression analysis on sea-level measurements (relative sea-level) from 225 long term tide gauges around the world, and found that “there’s been no sign of any acceleration (increase in rate) in most of those tide-gauge records, in over three-quarters of a century.”
The site summarizes:
The rate of measured sea-level rise (SLR) varies from -17.59 mm/yr at Skagway, Alaska, to +9.39 mm/yr at Kushiro, Japan. 197 of 225 stations (87.6%) have recorded less than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. At 47 of 225 stations (20.9%) sea level is falling, rather than rising. Just 28 of 225 stations (12.4%) have recorded more than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. The average SLR at those 225 gauges is +0.90 mm/yr. The median is +1.41 mm/yr.
MSL = 1.48 mm/yr

At their climate science critical site, Die kalte Sonne here, they write:
=====================================
At the end of March, 2016, climate alarmism once again was spread through the public. This time the Biblical flood was chosen. At Spiegel Online one could read:
Climate prognoses: Antarctic ice could melt more rapidly than expected
How stable is Antarctic ice? The answer to that question determines how high the sea level will rise in the future over the long-term. A new model calculation shows that the oceans could rise much more rapidly by the end of the century than  what models showed previously due to melt water. Earlier experts from the UN IPCC expected a comparatively moderate sea level rise of 18 cm from melting ice from Antarctica by 2100. For the current century scientists see glacier melt and retreat of ice in Greenland as the most important factors for sea level rise. Computer simulations by scientists led by Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, appearing in the journal of Nature, however, see in the worst case a rise of up to one meter alone from ice from Antarctica by 2100.”
Oh man. Antarctic sea ice is in fact growing currently, which isn’t keeping the alarmists from writing stories telling the opposite.
Here are the facts [for German readers, citing renowned institutes]:

=====================
Criticizing the mainstream is highly risky: Young scientists forced to conform to established models to avoid putting careers at risk
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
In Weltwoche of 6 April 2016 Prof. Mathias Binswanger was very clear on why young university researchers are quasi forced to submit themselves to the trends of the day, i.e. the overriding mainstream in any particular scientific field:
Mathias Binswanger: ‘The principle is ultimately always the same: Foremost one has to be an often published and often cited figure in his/her scientific field in order to be able to contribute to the ranking of a university. But how does one often publish or become often cited in respected journals of his own field? The most important principles are: Adaptation to the mainstream and do not question any established theories or models. All submitted articles first must go through a peer-review process where champions of the scientific discipline evaluate it. Under these circumstances a young researcher has no option but to go along with the mainstream theories represented in the top journals and to use the empirical processes that are currently in trend. Only in this way does he/she have any chance of having enough publications to make him/herself eligible to be a professor. Through this very kind of pressure to conform applied by top journals is science obstructed rather than promoted.'”

It is hardly necessary to mention that this principle promotes a “Stalinist conformity” with the highly politicized climate sciences for young researchers. typically today mostly only retired professors dare to speak up when it comes to doubt over the supposed imminent climate catastrophe. These professors finally beco0me free to openly express themselves without threats to their careers threatened.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp of the Science Skeptical site has a post on the latest climate predictions of Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the Director of the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The institute is influential and is famous for being staffed with scientists who are homogenously alarmist and at times zealously intolerant of dissenting views.
Kipp refers to an article appearing at the NTV German public television website titled: “Man as a geological force – The next ice age is no longer coming.”
The NTV article writes that large parts of the earth are geologically scheduled to be covered by ice sheets in 60,000 years but that “man has succeeded in preventing this ice age. Already.” This, the NTV reports, was recently said by Schellnhuber at the opening of the climate conference in Munich.
NTV writes:
The next ice age won’t be taking place believes renowned climate scientist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber. The reason is man-caused global warming. Without the influence of man the next episode of ice sheets covering large parts of the earth would happen in about 60,000 years according to the laws of cosmic mechanics, said Schellnhuber…”
Man “now able to suppress ice ages”
Schellnhuber said that the 500 billion tonnes of CO2 emitted by man into the atmosphere was “enough to prevent the onset of the next cold period.” Schellnhuber added, “Man has already become a powerful geological force that is even able to suppress ice ages.”
“As certain as the amen in Church”
The Potsdam Professor does not shy away from mixing religious undertones to underscore his 60,000 year global visions. He claims, according to NTV, that unless we act politically and quickly, a 2°C warming will be surpassed soon and the earth will become beset by cataclysmic climate events. The NTV quotes Schellnhuber:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The sea level over the long-term would rise an estimated six meters and many ecosystems, such as the coral reefs, would be destroyed . ‘That is as certain as the Amen in Church.'”
Can chaotic systems be forecast 60,000 years out?
Is Professor Schellnhuber a prophet?
So just how should we judge Professor Schellnhuber and his most recent cataclysmic visions? Does science really have the ability to forecast natural events 1000 years ahead, let alone 60,000? Is there a single scientist out there who claims to have the profound knowledge needed to predict how a chaotic system, one involving thousands of random variables, will be in 60,000 years time? The answer of course is no. Already we see that the climate models couldn’t even get the first 20 years right! How can they be expected to get the next 59,980 years correct?
The only other explanation left to explain the visions is that Professor Schellnhuber is in fact a prophet. He did, after all, have an audience with the Pope and perhaps Mr. Schellnhuber shared his God-communicated visions to His Holiness himself. Now, with the Pope’s blessings, Schellnhuber has returned to tell us that our sins of today are in fact denying life to the creatures that are supposed to inhabit the ice sheets of the next ice ages. Indeed he claims to have seen profound visions of future worlds melting away.
“Daring”
According to NTV, climate scientist Hans von Storch was asked to comment on Schellnhuber’s 60,000-year visions. NTV writes that his reaction was that “he views statements concerning time frames involving 60,000 years as daring“.
Von Storch obviously believes Schellnhuber neither has the scientific knowledge to make 60,000 year predictions, nor that he is a prophet bearing Visions of God.
It is truly incredible that today such wildly speculative visions are being marketed as valid scientific products, and are now being (mis)used as weapons of fear with the aim of ramming through an oppressive authoritarian climate policy. Recall that people who dare challenge this kind of extreme nonsense are today being threatened with legal prosecution! Where do we find ourselves when challenging obvious nonsense is now almost a crime?
It is truly astonishing that this has gotten this far. We should be worried – very worried. (๑ʘ∆ʘ๑)

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Paris countries signed a (non-binding) agreement on climate, and now coal will soon disappear from our lives, right? Think again.
A new paper by Japanese scientist Kyoji Kimoto published by Energy and Environment here suggests CO2 climate forcing has been grandly overstated, and as a consequence coal will remain an energy backbone for many nations in the future.
Kimoto maintains there’s been confusion over the Planck feedback parameters.
Here’s the abstract, emphasis added:
The central dogma is critically evaluated in the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory of the IPCC, claiming the Planck response is 1.2K when CO2 is doubled. The first basis of it is one dimensional model studies with the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5°K/km. It is failed from the lack of the parameter sensitivity analysis of the lapse rate for CO2 doubling. The second basis is the Planck response calculation by Cess in 1976 having a mathematical error. Therefore, the AGW theory is collapsed along with the canonical climate sensitivity of 3°K utilizing the radiative forcing of 3.7W/m2 for CO2 doubling. The surface climate sensitivity is 0.14-0.17K in this study with the surface radiative forcing of 1.1W/m2. Since the CO2 issue is removed, coal will be the energy for the future of many nations in terms of the amount of resource and production cost.”
“Basic errors” in the AGW theory
In an e-mail Kimoto wrote he has 5 years experience in the computer simulation of chemical processes and has read most of the leading papers of the AGW scientists and found basic mathematical errors in the theory. His paper suggests that coal’s effect on climate has been considerably exaggerated, and that it will remain an essential energy source for many countries long into the future – due to its economy, availability and reliability.
In the paper’s conclusion, Kimoto states:
The central dogma of the IPCC is theoretically failed that the zero feedback climate sensitivity (Planck response) is 1.2K for 2xCO2, resulting in the collapse of the AGW theory claiming the canonical climate sensitivity of 3K for CO2 doubling.”

How incompetent and clueless are Europe’s leaders?
Well this may be the first time in human history that Europe has chosen not to defend itself against an invasion. In fact it is even surrealistically welcoming it!
Dear Islamists, you have been dreaming a long time of overrunning Europe, with many of you thinking it will involve patience and might take some decades, or even a century or two. Well, good news for you – your wait is over! It can be yours in less than 10 years! It’s for real. Tens of thousands have already done it.
Why now? Never have European leaders been so incompetent, naïve, and so generous. They are welcoming you with open arms, gifts, food, money, free healthcare and warm places to stay. They want to show the whole world how good and moral they are – because they are suffering from a guilt trip of some strange sort.
Now is the time!

Now more than ever Islamic leaders need to be telling their flocks to spread the word, and to pack up and leave for Europe immediately. The continental borders to the south have totally collapsed – now wide open for crossing. Patchy resistance you might run up against is easily just run over by just a couple dozen men. Nobody is checking anything anymore.
Security for European citizens? What for? That’s not important anymore. No one is checking! We know you are all peaceful.
No passports? No problem. You can get them made in Turkey, or any other country along the way. Real passports are only for citizens.
So come on over! It’s wonderful here. Many are even ready to put you up in their homes should you need a place to stay. It really is so. The motto: “My home is your home!”
We are even ready to serve your every wish. Really.
We’re one happy world without borders now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA stunning story has developed and it is thoroughly embarrassing Germany’s (naïve) policy of welcoming everyone and anyone, from anywhere, and with little border control to speak of.
As the world has come to learn of the mass gang-sexual-attacks by mobs of men in Cologne during the New Year’s Eve celebrations, what we have in fact witnessed is the Chernobyl of sexual assault on women. No one imagined this possible in a civilized country.
See here for background.
All across Germany
The Huffington Post Germany reports here the mass sexual terrorism against women was much more widespread than just an isolated incident in Cologne, rather it extended to places like Hamburg, Stuttgart, Bielefeld, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Berlin.
14 and 15-year old raped
Now, according to the latest media report, two young teenage girls, aged 14 and 15, were also raped by a gang of four men in the Rhine town of Weil – so reports German public broadcaster SWR. The two teenagers allegedly were the victims of “young men from Syria aged 16 – 20“.
Media kept lid on story for days
Amazingly it took the German mainstream media 3 to 4 days to even begin reporting the mass crime, sparking sharp public anger and accusations of a cover-up.
Major print and public broadcasting outlets resisted reporting the Cologne sex assault catastrophe – that is until mass outrage exploded on social media and at a few independent outlets. It was not until January 4 did the mainstream media finally abandon their blackout. Earlier, over months, the German public had been put under psychological pressure by the media and political leaders with thinly veiled threats of being labeled racist or extremist should anyone express criticism of the uncontrolled refugee policy.
Spiegel bullies a critic
For example the massive pressure not to express criticism was yet again plainly demonstrated just yesterday as Spiegel journalist Christina Hebel, who in a commentary here, compared conservative Andreas Scheuer of the Christian Socialist Union (CSU) to right wing extremists – just because he dared criticize the media’s hesitation to report the story and their resulting squandering of the public trust.
Police first claimed Cologne NYE had been “peaceful”

At police authorities in Cologne, so far 122 150 victims have filed reports of sexual assault, theft or even rape. As the scandal spreads, a chorus of accusations that the authorities ignored warnings and simply stood helpless is growing louder.
Bizarrely on the morning of January 1, after the mayhem had simmered down, Cologne police put out the unbelievable press statement claiming that the city’s New Year’s Eve celebrations had been “peaceful” when in fact it more resembled D-Day.

(Note: NTZ does not share the views of the person(s) who uploaded the video at Youtube)
It seemed no one was in a hurry or dared to tell it like it was.
To make things worse, Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker later put some of the blame for the mass sexual assault on the victim themselves, telling at a press conference women should avoid standing too close to strangers, or traveling alone in order to avoid being assaulted. She said:
There’s always the possibility of keeping a certain distance of more than an arm’s length — that is to say to make sure yourself you don’t look to be too close to people who are not known to you, and to whom you don’t have a trusting relationship.”
With that it seems the mayor is telling German women they are now expected to do their part and change their behavior so as to accommodate men who cannot control their urges. Her poorly thought out comments were roundly and harshly criticized.
Europewide, “rape capital” Stockholm, Sweden
The public outrage has become so intense that even left-leaning feminists, such as Alice Schwarzer, are blasting the German immigration policy. The far left retaliated, accusing Ms. Schwarzer of being a “right wing feminist”. Other feminists and activists had long warned trouble was brewing. The mass sexual assault – arguably the terrorism of women – is not an isolated incident taking place in Germany, but has swept across Europe, writes conservative news outlet Breitbart here. Stockholm Sweden today is being called the “rape-capital of the world” because the problem has gotten so bad.
The question remains, and is becoming increasingly urgent: Will Europe’s leaders finally take their responsibility and the fears of citizens seriously, and take real action, or will they let the extreme right exploit it to the max? Failure here is not an option.
Europe has reached a very critical historical crossroad.

The Belgian online Le Peuple here interviewed István Marko, Professor of Chemistry at the UCL, and a so-called climate non-alarmist, on what he thought of the results of the highly ballyhooed Paris COP21 climate summit and agreement.
Photo: www.uclouvain.be
Unrealistic and laughable
His assessment is devastating. He calls the COP21 agreement a “grand illusion“, a “resounding failure” and one of “wishful thinking” on the part of the rich countries. He calls the 2.0°C warming target “unrealistic” – never mind the 1.5°C warming target, which in the interview he called “laughable“.
No enforcement mechanisms
Markó calls the COP21 agreement an “obvious failure” because there is no mechanism forcing the signatory countries to do what they just ‘promise’. “Nothing is binding.”
Markó says the rich countries have engaged in “wishful thinking“.
When it comes to the $100 billion in annual payments to developing countries, “nothing in the 10 pages of the 31-page final report assures this is going to happen”.
Will it be loans or donations? Will there be an interest rate that will be applied? And if so, which? What happens in the event of of non-payment! There’s no organ of control”.
Markó says, “Nobody knows how the European countries are going to finance these amounts to be paid to poor countries”.
No CO2 emissions decrease
Markó also tells Le Peuple more on why the COP21 agreement is nothing short of a folly:

China can continue to emit CO2 without restriction up to 2030. These emissions would correspond to an increase of 140% over its 2005 emissions, and India 150% of its 2005 emissions. Other developing countries can emit CO2 as they see fit. No decrease in emissions!”
Text filled with “should” instead of “shall”
For Professor Markó it is indeed a mystery how any serious environmental organization holding the belief that man-made CO2 emissions are damaging global climate would be satisfied with such a powerless agreement, which we are now seeing as being nothing more than an illusion of a binding treaty. Come Christmastime when environmentalists unwrap the package, they will quickly realize they’ve been sold a fake.
Markó also finds it amazing that countries who endorse the agreement will be able to still withdraw after 3 years:
Yet once again, nothing is binding.” Remember that U.S. Secretary, John Kerry had announced before, that if there were the slightest binding commitment, the US Senate would refuse the agreement.
He adds that throughout the text conditionals were added everywhere: “should” instead of “shall“.
Schellnhuber’s delirium
On the 2°C target, Markó says it has “strictly no physical or scientific basis” and that it is “nothing serious“. It is a randomly picked number by Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which Markó calls “the green lobby in Germany” and “a voice of the Church of climate alarmism“.
Markó reminds that not even Schellnhuber believes the alarmism he so gravely preaches, citing a Spiegel interview where “he had confessed that even if warming exceeds 2°C, humanity would not suffer”.
For him it is a symbolic figure, for political purpose. The message has been dramatized and 2°C has become the difference between the death of the planet and our very survival! Delirium.”
COP21 ends, realities return
At the end of the interview Markó summarizes that COP21 has no useful or serious results other than slowing growth in developed countries and rendering no benefit to developing countries. The only good Markó sees from COP21 is: “it is over and we finally can return to the realities.”

================================================
Solar activity in September 2015 / The latest science before the Paris Climate Conference
Guest post by Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
In September our sun was quite active during its current solar cycle (SC) number 24: The observed sunspot number (SSN) was 78.1. The average for all the previous cycles this far into the cycle is 83.5, and so September of this cycle was 93% of the usual activity.

Fig. 1: Cycle 24 activity (red) compared to the mean (blue) and to the earlier and similar Cycle Number 5.
Comparing the individual cycles to each other:

Fig. 2: The summation of the monthly deviations from the mean value (shown by blue curve in Fig. 1) for each cycle, up to month 82 since the start of the cycle. Cycle 24 started in December 2008.
We currently find ourselves no doubt on the downside of the cycle (see Fig. 1). Very often the cycles do not differ that much from each other. The important negative anomaly from the mean activity was produced already during the first 5 years of its duration.
Some physics before Paris
[Reviewed by Nicholas Lewis]
The big question that beckons to be answered before Paris is: How will the climate develop by the year 2100? What can and should be decided by policymakers so that global warming does not exceed the 2°C limit compared to pre-industrial times over the next 84 years?
At this blog we examined and concluded time and again that the anthropogenic impact on climate has been massively exaggerated by the institutionalized scientists. In any case the uncertainties in the assignment of the anthropogenic climate impact has been poorly considered. Natural factors, such as solar activity, were major factors in the past and will remain so in the future. They not only left a mark with the minimal changes in total solar irradiance (TSI), but it is not appropriate to set the sun’s impact at zero – as the IPCC does – and then assign a massive weight to the anthropogenic effects in the 21st century. For example Schellnhuber in 2009 claimed there is “an extremely simple quasi linear relationship between the global mean temperature and the total CO2 amount that will be emitted into the environment over the next decades”. In the following analysis we will ignore our own doubts and will calculate using the numbers from the IPCC.
Here we use the numbers of the IPCC AR5 on forcing: Read here.
In Table 1.2 the numbers for forcing in W/m² for a variety of factors are given, for example carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, land-use, etc.. This year a paper by Stevens was published on this, in which he assigned a new figure to the forcing by aerosols – pegging it at about 50% of what was stated in the a.m. document from the year 2013. We have reported on this on a number of occasions, e.g.: here/.
The relationship between total forcings and the observed temperatures since 1950 assuming it behaves as a linear function of the forcings (the current aerosol correction has been accounted for):

Fig. 3: Temperature anomaly using the HadCRUT4 temperature series as a function of the sum of forcings as a measure for determined global mean surface temperature (GMST).

A mean “transformation” of 0.338°C per W/m² of forcing can be read with a significant scatter among the individual annual mean values. Our climate also varies internally, not controlled by the external forcings. That becomes evident when we look at the individual years with their differences from the shown mean value (the residuals):

Fig. 4: The residuals of the individual years, their smoothing using the 11-year Loess-Filter (blue), and the smoothed difference of the ocean heat content (red) of both hemispheres.
The thinner blue line in Fig. 4 depicts special climate events over the past 60 years. Pronounced are the impacts of volcanoes (cooling) in the years 1984, 1985 and 1992-1994 and the 1998 El-Nino (warming). The volcanoes are shown here to be strong deviations from the forcings because these numbers are not sensible for the desired preview (we do not know when and how strong a volcanic eruption until 2100 will be) and the volcanic forcing had little impact on the temperature of a single year in the past during 1950-2014. The volcanic events were concentrated up to 1995, the consideration of the full forcing would inscribe a (negative) bias to the sensitivity of the temperatures versus the forcings. Therefore we omitted this also from the consideration of forcings  from the past.
The ENSO event in the tropical Pacific also will not be considered in the preview because it is a natural internal variability. If one smooths the smaller events with a low-pass filter (bold blue curve in Fig. 4) a long-term pattern emerges. We get hints about its emergence from a paper by a team led by Alexander Ruzmaikin of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The team works on the hemispheric radiation variability of the earth and has determined that it, among other things, reflects the heat content of the upper 700 meters of the oceans. Also Fig. 4 confirms this as the smoothed deviations from the trend (bold blue) show a large similarity to the interhemispheric difference of the heat content of the world’s oceans (bold red). This, the paper determined in its Figure 7, has its origin foremost in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. There are also many details on this, e.g.: http://www.kaltesonne.de/.
Whoever wishes to get more information about developments in the Atlantic, the following diagram is recommended:

Here our observations of January 2013 are updated.
Back to our question
What can we expect of our climate in the year 2100 if we follow the IPCC’s line of thought and take into account the new findings out since 2013?
From Fig. 3 we read off a climate sensitivity to forcing of 0.338°C per W/m². From Fig. 4 we get a variability of approx. 0.2 °C over the midterm, coming from the Atlantic and non-predictable time-limited spikes of up to 0.3°C in single years. The rise in Fig. 3 comes from almost exclusively the forcing from CO2. From the literature it can also be derived that other forcings (from other greenhouse gases, such as methane, the sun etc.) will remain as a whole in the range of 1 W/m². The IPCC generated scenarios of the irradiative forcing until 2100, except an unrealistic high projection (RCP 8.5), here assume here a more or less solo role for growth by CO2 increase. We now have everything together for making a projection.
An increase of 2°C by 2100 for pre-industrial levels might contain about 0.15°C, (“heat in the pipeline”) stemming from the reduced heat uptake efficiency of the oceans due to their already happened warming. Attaining the 2°C target requires that the global mean temperature can fluctuate about this 1.9°C – 2.1°C value because of natural variability (see Fig. 4). Therefore we use only 1.75 °C ( 1.9 – 0.15°C) which is expected to result through the further CO2 warming. The forcing then is 1.75/0.34 = 5.15W/m². We should reserve 1 W/m² for the remaining forcings outside of CO2, and thus 4.15 W/m² remains for carbon dioxide. This forcing can be calculated back to the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere: approx. 600 ppm would be the limit value allowed in order to reach the 2°C target. That means a doubling of the CO2 share compared to 1900. From today on there remains another 200 ppm over the next 84 years, which means 2.4 ppm/year growth. Over the last 85 years the CO2 content rose approximately 93 ppm. The current mean rise since 2000 is very close to 2 ppm (see www.esrl.noaa.gov/png).
In any case in the second half of the century we have to succeed in slowly bringing the annual CO2 growth rate back to zero by 2100 in order to meet the 2°C target. That is achievable with little trouble. The only requirement is that the 600 ppm level in 2100 should not be exceeded. Also a growth in the forcing by other greenhouse gases over the 1W/m² limit would be counterproductive. This result was also reached in another paper by a team led by Yoichi Kaya of the Research Institute for Innovative Technology of the Earth in Kyoto: http:springer.com/page-1.  The summary of the paper states:
This implies that 2°C target would still be a feasible target.”
Just as the mainstream climate science does, in our derivation we set the prerequisite that the climate system behaves linearly, i.e. that temperature changes respond proportionally to the changes in the forcings. This is unlikely. We reported recently on a paper that described the mechanism for “regulating” temperatures (foremost in the tropics and subtropics). It is also in no way sure that the forcing data of the 2013 AR5 will be valid in a few years time. However, we should and must begin grappling with the big questions somewhere.
Summary
We can summarize: Also with a CO2 increase of the current magnitude over the next 30 years, and accompanied by a gradual decrease in the CO2 growth rate, the 2°C target will still be met – even applying the hypotheses of the IPCC. Continued future technological progress up to 2100 will certainly meet the challenges we face concerning energy shortages, keeping the atmosphere below 600 ppm CO2 content – and thereby preventing excessive warming (think how 85 years ago around 1930 neither computer technology nor modern energy saving machines nor energy production with today’s efficiencies were imaginable) – all this without having to adopt an economic kamikaze program in Paris.

We see many articles and posts about the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) as an excuse for carbon taxes, but nothing about the Social Benefits of Carbon (SBC). The very reason civilization is consuming fossil fuels and producing carbon dioxide is ignored. Carbon-based fuels drive civilization and have done so since man’s taming of fire. They heat and light our homes and places of business, transport us and our goods, and fuel industry. All that energy production has value. Ignoring this value is as insane as if you only entered checks in your checkbook and ignored deposits.
There is great argument about the value of the SCC. The amounts are estimates based on the costs of production and future pollution and impacts primarily, and range from a few dollars per ton of CO2 to a few hundred dollars, depending on the computation method. Here are the U. S. government’s most recent figures:

Table 1 from whitehouse.gov here.
But all these computations ignore the benefits attached to consuming carbon fuels. At first glance, it may seem difficult to put a value on benefits due to all the myriad ways that fossil fuels are used. Producing electricity is one use, and this was addressed in Boosting Per Capita Prosperity And Energy Consumption Is The Only Way To Care For Our Planet posted here in June 2013. But a more fundamental way to measure the prosperity that fossil fuels provide is to simply compare the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the per capita CO2 emissions. The plot below uses data from the World Bank found here and here. The data from 2011 was used because that year had the most complete data.

Figure 1 is a plot of emissions versus GDP for 189 countries for which the World Bank has data for 2011. Both axis are logarithmic scales. For a version of this graph with country labels and population, go to this link at GapMinder.
The outliers in Figure 1 are small countries with unusual circumstances, such as Luxembourg and Qatar (upper right). The United States is the dark blue dot at the upper right. The European countries are clustered to the left of the US. It is clear that a high GDP requires high emissions but it doesn’t answer the question as to the value of a tonne of CO2. The next plot answers that question by dividing the per capita GDP by the emissions per capita for each country and plotting that against per capita emissions.

Figure 2. The vertical scale is the per capita GDP per metric tonne of CO2 emitted, this is the  Social Benefit of Carbon in each country. The horizontal scale is the CO2 emissions per capita. The large blue triangle on the right is the U. S. Both vertical and horizontal scales are logarithmic.
In figure 2, the first 19 countries on the left are in Africa, with very small emissions per capita but high GDP relative to those emissions. The European countries on the right have high emissions but most also have high GDP relative to those emissions. The three lowest GDP dots with high emissions are “‘stan” countries in central Asia. The social benefit of carbon for the 19 African countries is quite high because they use very little carbon now and would benefit greatly from using more. The U. S. SBC is $2,924.84. The country-average SBC of all the points in figure 2 is $3,774.75. The Social Benefit of Carbon is ten to a hundred times the estimated Social Cost of Carbon in Table 1.

By Dr. Dietrich E. Koelle
 [Translated/edited by P Gosselin]

Fig. 1: Structure of the Milky Way (Wikipedia, NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt)
Drawing conclusions on the development of the Earth’s climate from climate change on Mars would be quite difficult because there is no concrete data from Mars. But it is considerably easier to do this in the opposite direction: The large climate changes on Earth that occurred  cyclically about every 150 million years are traced back to a long-term fluctuation in cosmic ray intensity, or simply the radiation variation as to the various cosmic dust density conditions as the solar system traveled through the spiral arms of our Milky Way galaxy.
It is known that the solar system orbits about the center of the Milky Way every 220 million to 240 million years at a distance of 25,000 to 28,000 light years from the center. The Milky Way’s diameter is roughly 100,000 light years.
These radiation intensity fluctuations repeatedly led to global mean temperature extremes here on Earth that ranged from 0°C (Snowball Earth) to 28°C, which saw palm trees in Antarctica (see Fig. 2).
Earth is currently in the middle of an ice age

Approximately 2.5 million years ago a new large ice age began. It is one that we are not really aware of because we happen to find ourselves in one of the 10,000-year relatively warm but brief interglacial periods, which we call the Holocene.
These roughly 10,000-year interglacials have been occurring about every 100,000 years over the past million years.If these extreme temperature fluctuations occurred due to changes in radiation intensity, then they also had to occur on the other planets of our solar system, for example on Mars.As was the case on Earth, this means that considerably higher temperatures would necessarily been the case there 100 million years ago (also 270 million years ago). These warm conditions would have permitted liquid water to exist on the planet’s surface.
Recently traces of such water have been detected on multiple occasions by NASA.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote about how wind park planners and the city councilmen who recklessly approve them may be held personally liable for damage to health that they cause, primarily through infrasound.  With locals wind parks, too often crony deals are involved and legitimate opposition gets brushed aside or squashed. The result is often a select few end up lining their pockets while the rest are left to suffer.
A few days ago the German language NWZ mobil here reported on a heated wind park controversy that is boiling over in northwest Germany, writing that “state attorneys are now opening investigations on the profiteers of big money wind energy and how planned wind parks are dividing communities“.
The NWZ mobil writes:
Wind energy makes some rich, the others sick, as tensions peak at the North Sea coast.”
The controversy swirls around opposition to a planned wind park expansion near the home of Wolfgang Mänzel in the village Stedesdorf.
NWZ mobil reports Mänzel at first was enthusiastic about wind parks near in his community, and even invested in the nearby “Citizens’ Wind Park Stedesdorf” nearby, with the hopes of reaping returns. But all that has since changed.
The returns on the investment have been disappointing and investors such as Mänzel have since realized that the business opportunity was never meant to make them rich at all, but rather was set up “to help raise the acceptance for wind energy out in the countryside by using financial incentives,” The NWZ mobil writes. In reality the terms of the investment scheme were all along designed to make a select group of planners and councilmen rich, but not the small investors.
Its no surprise that in Stedesdorf those really profiting the most are now trying to expand the wind park by another 5 turbines. But Wolfgang Mänzel and others feel they were misled by some of the councilmen. It turns out three of the them have a direct stake in the expansion project and stand to profit even more handsomely.  Now there are growing accusations of corruption and the town stands bitterly divided amid a thickening atmosphere of distrust and deep suspicion.

The NWZ mobil writes that wind energy critics and opponents now live in an atmospheres of threats and hostility. The NWZ mobil reports:
Wind energy is a multi-million euro business: high state subsidies, guaranteed for years, paid for by the power consumers.
Wind energy is in part a criminal business. Not only local politicians are profiting. The mafia launders money by investing in wind parks.”
To protest the seemingly self-serving projects, in October 2015 Mänzel and others founded a citizens initiative against the wind park expansion, and published an open letter to make the affair more public. The recent accusations of corruption have since led to authorities launching an investigation of the “Stedesdorf Wind Park”.
The NWZ reports:
At the state prosecutor’s office in Osnabruck, two anonymous reports of wrongdoing have been filed at the end of January against five partners. Now the state attorney’s office in Celle is investigating for possible bribes to parliamentarians.”
Welcome to the real world of German “green energy”.
In the meantime there has been some good news. NDR television here reports that the additional 5 turbines that had been planned to be added have been overwhelmingly rejected by local citizens, with 80% voting against them – though the vote is non-binding.

Piccard says, ‘What we have here is the future’.
That would be progress going backwards in high gear. Thomas reminds us early devices did the trip far more quickly: “The Graf Zeppelin in 21 days in 1929“, and “Someone could walk the plane’s route (somehow) in two years, not much longer than the flight time.”
Of course pilot and project pitchman Piccard does not see it that way, and promotes the months-long grounded plane as breakthrough technology:

If there ever was a symbol of green delusionism, Solar Impulse 2 is it.

The slightly negative linear trend in global temperature measured by RSS satellite (TLT) continues despite the El-Nino-driven warm 2015.

Source: www.woodfortrees.org trend
This flat trend has held since the end of 1997 and is closing in on two decades – catching a number of scientists by surprise.
The preliminary data from UAH and RSS shows that 2015 was the third warmest year since the measurements began in 1978, and thus did not set a new record. A reanalysis of the global 2m temperature from CFSv2 measured a positive deviation from the mean of 0.27 K, but put the year 2015 only in 6th place:

Note that the poles in the chart have been stretched out and so appear much larger in size than what they actually are. Source: What Causes El Nino Warmth?
This all means that more than half of the satellite measurement era has seen no warming whatsoever!

In Germany according to a DWD press release dated 30 December 2015, the mean temperature for 2015 was 9,9°C and so was the second warmest on record, tied with 2000 and 2007, despite the unusually warm November and December months, which were dominated by mild southerly winds.
Polar ice growth
A big surprise for many has been the ice growth measured in Greenland since 2014. Moreover the Greenland ice sheet has gown some 300 km³ since September 1, 2015 alone:

Top: The total daily contribution to the surface mass balance from the entire ice sheet (blue line, Gt/day). For comparison, the mean curve from the period 1990-2013 is shown (dark grey). The same calendar day in each of the 24 years (in the period 1990-2013) will have its own value. These differences from year to year are illustrated by the light grey band. For each calendar day, however, the lowest and highest values of the 24 years have been left out.” Source: www.dmi.dk/en/greenland-ice-mass-budget/.
It’s also worth taking a look at the surprising NASA-Study here!
The northern hemisphere in November 2015 saw a total of 36.25 million km² of snow cover. That’s about 2.3 million km² above the WMO 1981-2010 mean. It’s the 7th greatest extent since measurements began in 1966.

Northern hemispheric snow cover in November for the 2011 to 2015 five-year period set a new record since measurements began in 1966. The 40-year trend is strongly upwards. Source: http://climate.rutgers.edu/month=11.
In summary the global temperature, polar ice and snow cover trends show no warming taking place, but rather harbor strong signals of cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlmost 2 years ago I reported here on a comprehensive study conducted by the Austrian University of Graz showing vegans and vegetarians tend to have significantly more mental disorders and health issues than meat-loving people.
Photo credit: Alpha, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
Well, that post has been brought back the public’s attention – and how! Over the past couple of days it has taken off and gone viral, being shared or liked at Facebook over a quarter million times.
Obviously people have been asking why some environmentally active and veggie-leaning people are acting so weird, irrational and at times even hysterical, especially when it comes to climate change. Looks like nutrition may actually be one factor here – in addition to the sorrowful state of Western education and academia.
Nutrition is often a seriously under-estimated factor when it comes to our health – really! Being deficient in just one or two vitamins, and/or minerals or trace elements is enough to make any person seriously ill. Poor nutrition during pregnancy can lead to severe birth defects. Nutritional deficiencies are also often the root cause of mental illness and depression. Too often people totally under-estimate the role of nutrition in their health.
The now famous University of Graz study came up with some sobering findings:
1. Vegetarians are more often ill and have a lower quality of living than meat-eaters.
2. Vegetarians showed 166% higher cancer rates (4.8% to 1.8%).

3. Vegans had a 150% higher rate of heart attacks (1.5% to 0.6%).
4. Vegetarian’s show more psychological disorders than meat eaters.
5. They are a greater burden on the health care system.
6. Vegetarians have twice as many allergies as big meat-eaters.
I don’t want to discourage people from eating vegetarian diets, as these can be highly beneficial IF they include eggs, dairy products and fish on a regular basis. For example for people who suffer from obesity, the vegetarian diet can actually be therapeutic if not taken to an extreme – and done over a limited period, monitored by a competent physician.
However, people who are considering the vegan lifestyle – one that rejects the consumption of almost every animal-based food product – they absolutely need to be extremely wary. The draconian diet often FALSELY promises health. Most experts will tell you that veganism is a very risky and potentially dangerous diet – especially for children and pregnant women.
By nature the human organism, forged by some 3 million years of evolution, is an omnivore and thus is designed to consume, digest and metabolize both animal and plant-based foods. A balanced diet is imperative for maintaining good health. Deny this at your own risk.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Vermont news site Vermont Digger here presents a commentary by Vermont state Senator John Rodgers who represents my childhood home county of Orleans, and Essex county as well.
Photo: Industrializing Vermont’s idyllic landscape. Cropped from video by Green Mountain Power Corp.
Senator Rodgers has had it with industrial wind energy ruining his state’s environment, announcing:
I will join with the growing number of Vermonters who have concluded that industrial wind turbines do not belong in Vermont, period.”
As a consequence, in 2016 Rodgers plans to introduce a bill that would ban industrial wind turbines, sending them the way of the billboard. Rodgers position illustrates the rapidly growing resistance to industrial wind parks erected on Vermont’s idyllic Green Mountains.
“Devastating” impact
Recently nearby wind-parks in Sheffield and Lowell have driven the message home to local residents and tourists that the green energies aren’t green at all and that they are coming with a unexpectedly high environmental price. Rodgers, in his piece, calls the environmental impacts of wind turbines “devastating”.
Corrupt legislators, campaign finances for environmental ruin
Moreover Rodgers, a Democrat no less, accuses the Vermont legislature of political corruption:

We have legislators who write policy to serve the very utilities and energy developers that finance their campaigns.”
He also blasts industrial solar fields in Vermont, another state where the sun doesn’t shine at night and one which often sees snow 6 months a year. He supports restrictions on large-scale solar installations, which he says benefits no one except solar industry profiteers. He writes that covering farmland and forests with solar panels reduces the amount of land available to grow food.
No affect on climate
The Vermont state senator writes that even the Public Service Department acknowledges that Vermont green energy policies will have no affect climate change, yet that they severely damage the local environment. He calls on protecting the state’s forests and not industrializing them.
Vermont’s power is already carbon neutral – why ruin the landscape for nothing?
It should be noted that some 150 years ago Vermont was mostly deforested due to its early sheep farming.
Moreover some 90% of the state’s electric power has come from carbon neutral sources already!, such as Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant and hydroelectric power from Quebec. Vermont has far fewer than a million inhabitants and there is no sense whatsoever in ruining its landscape for something that will have absolutely zero impact whatsoever on the climate. It all boils down to green ideological showboating – one that comes with a terrible environmental heritage price.
Hopefully, more political leaders will follow Rodgers’s lead and think seriously about what they are wreaking upon the state’s beauty. As it stands, too many politicians have been governing under the influence of “green” dope and climate science BS. Unfortunately it looks like it’s going to take a massive environmental hangover before they sober up from all the climate insanity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Europe, especially Germany, diesel engines are quite popular. The oil-burning combustion motors get far better fuel mileage and the price of fuel in the country is some 20% cheaper than gasoline – thanks to lower taxes.
With fuel prices today at the lowest level they’ve been in quite some time, German motorists are once again enjoying the low-cost motoring and are thus more inclined to take extra trips with dem Auto. Lately the price of diesel fuel has even dipped below 1 euro per liter (about $4.30 a US gallon) – in heavily taxed Europe a real bargain compared to a just a few years ago.
But not everyone is happy about the low fuel prices. Yesterday Spiegel opined on the falling diesel prices, complaining that “the low-cost fuel is no reason to celebrate“, warning that “for the low cost diesel, we are going to pay a heavy price“. This is typical of the German media. As soon as something good happens, they have to find a way to rain all over it.
Why does Spiegel think this is going to cost a “heavy price”? The center-left flagship weekly thinks the extra driving that Germans will do as a result of the low prices is going to cause more emissions of dangerous “cancer-causing” fine particles and nitrous oxide, which in turn of course will cost “human lives”.
Ridiculously Spiegel uses smog-choked China as an example as to why Germans are going to die from higher emissions. In reality, German smog is only a small fraction of a small fraction of Chinese smog, and so Germans aren’t at all concerned about a few particles.
Those in favor of cheap diesel outnumber those against it by a margin of 2 – 1!

For now Germans are quite content with the latest diesel fuel price trend, just as an online poll of its readers that accompanies the story now shows. So far as of 8:20 p.m. CET, some 95,000 readers have answered their one-question survey question:
Diesel is cheaper than it’s been in a long time. What’s your opinion on this?
The result: Over 60% say that this is good news for motorists or that the fuel should be even cheaper.
Less than one third say diesel fuel should be more expensive. This is hardly good news for the environmental activists.
Overall even green-conscious Germans prefer low cost fossil-fuel diesel by a margin of 2 to 1! Of course this is not a scientific survey. Yet the results show that people are generally fine with the low fuel prices. Electric cars face yet another obstacle.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest dubious climate scare story just out involves a far-fetched thought-spiel that creates a scenario of what would happen if all the world’s fossil fuels were burned – that scenario all based on an inflated CO2 climate sensitivity and crystal ball quality science.
The theorized result would be the possible melting of Antarctic ice and a 120+meter rise in sea level – “over thousands of years“. Little wonder already a number of scientists have dismissed the report as wildly speculative and of no value.
Well, in an equally far-fetched scenario people should instead consider the grave consequences of what would result if NO fossil fuels were burned, i.e. the opposite of burning all the fossil fuels. What would happen if the supply of fossil fuels were suddenly cut off today in our modern and prosperous society? The consequences would be cataclysmic and would occur immediately, and not over hundreds or thousands of years.
First without fossil fuels a majority of the world’s power plants (powered by coal, oil and gas) would stop. This would lead to widespread, permanent blackouts. Industries and the their output of life-sustaining goods would grind to a halt. Household appliances would cease to operate, meaning perishables stored in our refrigerators and freezers would begin to spoil within a matter of days, if not hours. Water would cease coming out of the taps because the public water works would be idled by the power loss. Cooking, bathing and sanitation would stop. Toilets would become inoperable. Sanitation services would not take our refuse away. Garbage would pile up within days.
Would you be able to just drive to the supermarket and get the things you need? Traffic control systems and signals would switch off and traffic would turn into mayhem. Within hours cars and trucks would run out of fuel and stall, leaving millions of motorists stranded over tens of thousands of miles of streets littered with abandoned vehicles. Stranded motorists would be left to fend for themselves. Grocery store shelves, not being refilled by delivery trucks, would quickly be looted.

Entire information and communication systems would be dead, ATM machines would stop, lights and power at schools and hospitals would go out. The healthcare system would collapse immediately. Forget calling the authorities. Emergency vehicles would cease to operate because they would have no fuel. Police, fire and ambulances would not be able to respond to calls. Law enforcement would be paralyzed, which would lead to instantaneous anarchy and mayhem. Rapists, murderers and criminals would have a field day. Violent gangs would soon take over. Loved ones on business trips, vacations, universities, weekend trips would never be seen again because there would be no way for them to return, except by taking the perilous journey through the mayhem on foot. All air traffic would be grounded. Most would be stranded and left to fend for themselves.
Next imagine it’s wintertime with temperatures well below freezing and the wind outside is howling. Your home is without heat, lighting, electricity or water. How are you going to prepare your next meal, wash your clothes, bathe or stay warm? Immediately homes would turn cold and millions and frozen water pipes would burst. Millions of people would start chopping tress down to burn for heat to stay warm. In no time our skies would be choked by ash and particulates.
In the summer within hours millions would begin to suffer from hunger and dehydration. To comprehend the utter hell you would find yourself in, imagine what your next step would be when you find that your fridge is empty and there’s no more water and electricity? You’re hungry and thirsty, you’re craving for food and your children are sick. What are you going to do? Walk to the supermarket? These will be long since looted. Any meat and dairy products left at the markets will be rotted and the place overrun by rats and insects. To quench your thirst you might consider drinking the untreated water from a local stream. Good luck with that. You can go outside and make a fire to sterilize the water, but you’re hungry and there’s nothing to eat. Suddenly your dog or cat starts looking like a meal, or worse, you start looking like a meal for all the abandoned dogs now running stray. Humans would start cannibalizing, with the strong preying on the weak. Syria and ISIS in comparison would look like a Love Parade parade event!
The regions with nuclear power would be better off – at least at first – but not for long as they would soon would be overrun by a tsunami of millions of blackout refugees. Chaos would ensue. Society would break down into a free-for-all.
By now you get the picture. Hundreds of millions would perish within a matter days and weeks – killed by exposure, dehydration, starvation, disease or murder. Billions would die within weeks and months.
So what do you prefer? That scenario, or a sea level rise of 100 meters over 5000 years?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWinter carnivals are popular, and naturally organizers hope to get cold and snow to make sure they go well.
Years ago global warming activists were warning that the days of winter carnivals were numbered, and that snow would be soon a thing of the past. Winter carnivals faced cancellations due to missing snow and balmy weather caused by manmade climate change.
This year the predictions of cancellation have finally come true – at least in Plattsburg, New York, this weekend. According to organizers, its scheduled annual carnival has been canceled – not because of a lack of snow and warm weather, but rather because of extreme cold. See forecast here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust days ago news emerged that leading French meteorologist Philippe Verdier was reportedly sent on “forced holiday” from broadcaster France 2 for releasing book accusing top climatologists and politicians of “taking the world hostage” using deceptive data. Read the story here.

Philippe Verdier. Photo: www.change.org
The name of the book is titled is Climat Investigation and in it Verdier claims climate scientists have been “manipulated and politicised” and maintains that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) “blatantly erased” data that went against their overall conclusions, and that their climate models are inaccurate.
Monsieur Verdier now faces losing his job for holding such data-based dissenting views.
Laurent Fabius incites fear of “climate chaos”
One of the most troublesome aspects of the scandal is that top French politicians have been actively resorting to Orwellian tactics in an attempt to grotesquely distort the science and to incite irrational fear among French citizens. The Telegraph writes M. Verdier…
“…decided to write the book in June 2014 when Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, summoned the country’s main weather presenters and urged them to mention “climate chaos” in their forecasts.”

This is an absolute abuse of power, and must be regarded as intolerable.
Verdier fights back with a petition
But the French meteorologist is not backing off, and sees the move by France 2 as attempted punishment for practicing a legitimate freedom of expression and a violation of the spirit of open discussion that democracies are supposed to guarantee. He has posted the following petition:
Philippe Verdier, a journalist in charge of the weather service of the French public TV channels France Télévisions, is threatened in his job and his career for having published a non-conformist book about climate. Even if he emphasizes that he is not a climate skeptic, Philippe Verdier points out in his book all the erring ways of climate policies. He also criticizes the IPCC and its ideological views that have just nothing to do with science.
The origin of his book is Laurent Fabius’ explicit and recent attempt to get full support of all French weathermen prior to COP21, the international climate conference that will be held in Paris late November. Laurent Fabius is the French Foreign Minister and also the future president of this conference.
In January, citizens from all countries in the world stood up for freedom of speech, with « Je suis Charlie » as a motto. Time has come to stand up again. The Collectif des climato-réalistes call on you to sign this petition regardless of your opinion about climate change.”
Reader are urged to sign the petition and to urge as many others as possible to do the same.

He presents a fascinating statistic that tells us the alarmist claims being made today about higher and stronger storm frequency over the Atlantic are in fact a lot of hype and wild exaggeration.

Joe Bastardi’s chart showing that USA saw far more hurricane hits in the late 1800’s. Source: Screenshot from here.
The 30-year period from 1871 – 1900 saw 20 major hurricanes, i.e. 67% more than the 12 seen over the 1986 – 2015 period. Landfall points from 1871 – 1900 totaled 65, which is about 70% more than the recent 30-year period.

What more do you want?
Trump is right
Also Joe makes the very important point that in former times hurricane intensity was measured when they made landfall, and not while they were out to sea. Today modern instruments and satellites allow cyclones to be watched from birth to death, and very often these cyclones are stronger when they are over warm open waters. But as they approach land, they wind up intaking energy-sapping dry air form over the land and are weaker when they make landfall.
Also Bastardi confirms that Donald Trump was correct in his statement where he claimed hurricanes used to be stronger.
Bastardi does pour some cold water on hurricane frequency, claiming in his video that he doesn’t think hurricane variability is anything different than it was.

Share this...FacebookTwitterE.on, Europe’s largest power company, lost almost 7 billion euros last year (2015). A year earlier it lost 3.2 billion euros.
The German power giant was hit not only by low prices on the electricity exchanges, but the losses were also due to significant “impairment charges” as the company writes down the value of its conventional coal and gas power plant assets.

“Difficult times” says E.on Chairman of the Board and CEO Johannes Teyssen   Source : E.ON SE 
That sort of thing happens when a power company is forced by law to buy haphazard, money-losing solar and wind energy at exorbitant prices and sell it at a loss on the power exchanges. There’s no turnaround in sight.
What we are witnessing is the collapse of Germany’s power industry – thanks to the Energiewende (transition to green energies).
E.on CEO Johannes Teyssen spoke of “difficult times” at a press conference on Wednesday morning. Over the past two years the Essen-Germany-based company has lost over 10 billion euros!

Bloomberg reports here:
 ‘The general economic environment and the situation in our industry have deteriorated significantly,’ Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen told reporters on Wednesday in Essen.”
Unsurprisingly the massive losses stemmed in large part from the area of power generation, where sales fell 34%. The operation of gas-fired power plants is no longer profitable due to the low prices on the energy exchanges.
Worse, the low prices from excessive production are not even making their way to the consumers. Although generated power is sold at low prices on the exchange markets due to surplus production from wind and sun, consumers are getting no benefit. German consumers are now paying near record prices for electricity (approx. €0.29/kw-h). Often coal-fired power plants run idle as well. experts have warned that the Energiewende may cost German consumers a trillion euros.
Share prices of Eon have also taken a terrible beating. In early 2008 the price for a share stood near 50 euros. Today a share stands at a measly 8 euros.
Spiegel here calls the losses at Eon “dramatic”.
Already in 2013 The Economist warned of an impending disaster for Germany’s energy sector.

=======================================
The Sun in October 2015
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
In October, 2015, our mother star was less active than in September. The solar sunspot number (SSN) was 61.7, only 72% of what is normal this month into the cycle compared to the mean of the observed cycles since occurring 1755. In detail:
Fig. 1: Our current Solar Cycle 24, which started in December 2008, is shown by the red curve and is compared to the mean cycle (blue) and to the very similar solar cycle 5 shown by the black curve.
What really stands out are negative anomalies that occurred during the cycle ramp-up and the ensuing plateau phase. Until the 54th month the sun was only 47% as active as the mean. But later beginning at about month number 62 the current cycle followed along below the mean closely. Since then the current cycle has been tracing at about 73% of the mean value. Over the entire cycle so far the current cycle has been running on average at 56% of the mean. What follows is a comparison of all cycles:

Fig. 2: Comparison of all the cycles. The bars represent the SSN anomaly from the mean for 83 months into the cycle.

One clearly sees the activity hump in the middle of the 20th century, from SC 17 to SC 23. This was recently investigated at a conference at the end of October, 2015, which worked out the solar forcing for a new generation of climate models (CMIP6):

Fig. 3: Solar forcing for new climate models, source: Matthes & Funke 2015.
The contribution by Katja Matthes of the Geomar Center in Kiel, Germany and Bernd Funke of the Astrophysical Institute in Granada sees an increase of approximately 1 W/m² on average between 1880 and the level of 1950 to 2000 (light blue curve in Fig 3). Now a prediction until 2075 sees a drop in value to that of 1880 (grey in Fig. 3). One, however, does need to be careful with the forecast. The sun is a very dynamic star. Yet, the assumption that the solar irradiance is constant, which was the case in the older models (CMIP5 in light green), is being abandoned.
Today the solar forcing of the sun is assumed to be greater by a factor of 5 over what was assumed just a few years ago (e.g. Feulner & Rahmstorf 2010) when conventional climate science and also the IPCC accounted for a solar irradiance TSI variation of only 0.2W/m².
Clearly the sun is gaining more influence in the world of climate modeling, as it is getting neglected less in the new models. However we will not being hearing anything about these findings from the media during the upcoming Paris conference: There the sun will have no effect on our current climate. The only thing of any concern in Paris is trace gas CO2.

– IPCC-friendly group of climate activists withdraw video: Rahmstorf study no longer the scientific consensus
– New study by Durham University downgrades Rahmstorf’s flood scenario for North Carolina to a fairy tale
