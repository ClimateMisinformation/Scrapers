"Polluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections. The moves by the fossil fuel, motor, aviation, farming, plastic and timber sectors are described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. Environmental campaigners describe some participants in these industries as “coronavirus profiteers”.  Economic and energy leaders say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a safer, more resilient, world. However, such action has been lacking to date, they warn. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “When I look at different parts of the world I have not seen yet a major emphasis on clean-energy technologies.” He warned of mistakes similar to those made after the 2008 financial crisis when stimulus packages led to the biggest leap in carbon emissions in 50 years, four times greater than the reduction initially seen. “If we put the money in the right place, we can manage the [climate] risk, and have a much more modern, cleaner and safer energy system,” Birol told the Guardian. “But if you put the money in the wrong place we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets.” Rachel Kyte, at Tufts University, US, a former UN special representative for energy and former World Bank Group vice president, said: “Covid-19 puts our economies at a fork in the road. Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn’t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn’t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it’s dangerous.” Unlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery. Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the Green Deal at the European commission, said: “[Tackling the Covid-19 emergency] cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity’s most daunting challenges.” “Bailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.” The nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: “We know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.” Lord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: “The nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.” But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors. Michael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. “As governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy … no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.” Ben Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. “But so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.” The course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. “I think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.” Timmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was clear about the need to rebuild a different global economy. “Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMentioning the lethal “100-year, record-smashing” spring cold and snow spreading across Europe over the past month has for the most part been avoided like the plague by Germany’s mainstream media. The silence over the record cold and frost, which has killed thousands and cost billions, has been ear-ringing.
Yet some leading dailies are breaking ranks, and have begun to examine the phenomenon critically and openly.
For example veteran journalist Ulli Kulke at German flagship daily Die Welt today has stunned the rest of the German mainstream media with a piece titled Scientists warn of ice age.

German flagship daily reports that “scientists warning of ice age.” Logo: DIE WELT.
Kulke writes that recently a growing number of scientific publications have been appearing in leading journals, and that they have been challenging the simplistic “one dimensional CO2 explanation” for climate change and showing that even the unlikely “doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2050 would not have dramatic effects.”
Kulke writes:

Yet, papers with such content, even though they have passed the peer-review process, do not make any headlines. But they have been becoming much more frequent recently.”
Increasingly it seems more and more scientists are now seeing huge opportunity in overturning one of the most ballyhooed scientific hypotheses of modern time, funding be damned.
In the Die Welt piece, Kulke asks if the record cold and snow over much of the northern hemisphere “is just a coincidence“. The odds are increasing that it is not, and that it’s not for nothing that a growing number of scientists are becoming friendly to other explanations and that the body of evidence supporting a combination of explanations is taking shape quickly. Kulke writes that it is therefore no surprise that 2 Russian scientists have recently joined the ever more thunderous chorus of alternative explanations on what drives climate. He writes:
It’s probably no coincidence that ever louder scientific opinions warning of an imminent ice period are coming also from Russia. Vladimir Baschkin and Rauf Galiulin have recently recognized the ice age possibility in a study. Both biogeochemists – a discipline that also includes the study of the Earth’s atmosphere – have written a study for the Research Institute Vniigaz of the Gazprom concern, an address of course that cannot be said is free of lobbyists. However, their arguments are underpinned by findings that are gaining more and more acceptance from independent science: solar activity is weakening considerably – to an extent that was last seen several hundred years ago, the Little Ice Age, according to scientists.”
Kulke writes that not only is the CO2-science for explaining climate change one-dimensional, but that also only looking at changes in solar irradiance is completely inadequate. The sun’s fluctuating magnetic activity and its impact on the Earth’s atmosphere, direct and indirect, though not well understood, are proving to have a far greater influence on the Earth’s climate than many are willing to admit. This is all being backed up by leading research institutes such as CERN in Geneva and the Danish National Space Institute of Denmark.

"Recovery from coronavirus must reckon with climate change. The current and urgent focus properly needs to be flattening the curve and saving lives. Yet even as this overriding priority absorbs us, governments now need to be thinking about how to support the strongest possible recovery as we emerge from this crisis.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, underscores we are in both a health and economic crisis. In dealing with the former we cannot lose a generation to the latter. Focus on recovery must be on maximising economic growth and jobs, and ensuring this includes everyone. This was the guiding star that steered the international response to the global financial crisis. I was advising the prime minister Kevin Rudd at that time and saw first hand just how much foresight, coordination and effort was required for success. This is much worse, and so will demand so much more. Reckoning with climate change will support a strongest possible recovery. The threat of climate change that is driving global action against it has not gone away. Indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic is a harbinger of climate disasters to come and the resilience we need to build into our systems – including health – to deal with what we know will be the adverse impacts of climate change. We know that unless we address this challenge, we will all be worse off; and the longer we take in addressing the challenge, the worse it will be. Just as Covid-19 requires us to act now to save lives in the next few weeks, climate change requires action now to avert a future global catastrophe. The logic of climate action has increasingly applied to global economic activity since the Paris agreement and must continue to underpin the investment decisions governments make going forward. Decisions that support the strongest possible recovery in growth will help to shape the future of the Australian economy. We must ensure these pathways to the future do not lock-in those that lead to damaging dead-ends: higher emissions and less climate resilience down the track to our economic, environmental and community disadvantage. Borrowing, as we are, from our kids to fund the billions in recovery stimulus, we cannot further burden them with such dead-ends. Significantly, climate related investments in many cases will offer the best prospects for economic growth and jobs. On that basis alone they should be prioritised. The OECD report Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth demonstrated this in detail for the G20 in 2018. For example, they provide options for major infrastructure investments which should be a bedrock of government stimulus for recovery: clean energy and new transport systems, more sustainable homes and buildings, improved agricultural practices water and waste management. In short, if banks will not finance new coal-fired power in Australia but will lend for renewable energy and storage, which would you tend toward, and where then are the growth and jobs, and best place for stimulus? Corporates are increasingly working this out. There were a slew of announcements over summer largely subsumed by our preoccupation with drought, bushfires and pandemic. They show business banking on climate smart investment for growth. The most significant example was BlackRock announcing a game-changing move to place sustainability at the centre of its investment approach because the returns to investors will be greater. BlackRock manages over US$7tn of assets, meaning other large asset managers will follow, as happened days after the announcement when State Street – managing US$3tn – went the same way. As corporates are now integrating climate change as core business strategy, so should governments as core economic strategy, not least for recovery. We know where such investments can be made. They are not hypothetical, whether outlined in CSIRO’s excellent technology roadmap for a low-emissions Australian economy, or Ross Garnaut’s recent excellent book on the growth opportunities Superpower: Australia’s Low Carbon Opportunity or last week’s inspiring report by Climate Works on de-carbonising Australia’s future, or presumably in the government’s forthcoming low-emissions technology roadmap for Australia. We are not short on ideas, including on climate resilience. An obvious starting point could be a nation-building stimulus investment around our decrepit energy system. By now the federal and state governments have a much stronger grasp of what we need for success, encouragingly evident on the recent $2bn federal-New South Wales government package for better access, security and affordability. Turbocharging this with a stimulus package for more renewable energy and flexible storage of all sorts (including hydrogen), accompanying transmission and security technologies for our electricity grid, and investment in dramatically improving energy efficiency would – literally and figuratively – power our economy forward. Not just for the growth and jobs in this sector alone but in the scope provided to power other sectors for growth, such as electrifying transport across the country – which stimulus could also spur. In the aftermath of our drought and bushfires, another obvious area for nation-building investment is our land sector. Farm productivity can be dramatically improved by precision agriculture and regenerative farming technologies while building resilience to drought. New sources of revenue for farmers can be created through soil carbon and forest carbon farming – with carbon trading from these activities internationally set to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade. These solutions and sources of growth and jobs can be harvested now with a little government support, keeping farmers on their land and regional communities thriving. In these times of despair this prospect holds out great hope. Showing it is not a dream, the EU has already said its recovery stimulus will invest in climate for growth and jobs. We should too.

"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air. Widespread travel restrictions around the world have slashed demand for air travel, with more than eight in 10 flights canceled. But there is a disparity in the US – while the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported a 96% slump in passenger volume, to a level not seen since 1954, this hasn’t been matched by the number of flights being scrapped.  Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.” This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America. In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people. The aviation industry accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions, although this is concentrated among the small fraction of the world’s population that regularly flies. The reduction in flights is expected to reduce pollution levels, with emissions from the sector dropping by almost a third last month, the Financial Times has reported. However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis. “You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.” The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights. The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it. According to Airlines for America, an industry group, more than a third of the US fleet, about 2,400 aircraft, have been parked, with airlines burning through cash at more than $10bn a month as cancellations “far outpace” new bookings. Planes have gone from “load factors” of 80% in January to just 11% in April. “The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail. Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.”  A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint. The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet. Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”. • This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to replace the main image with one that was more relevant to the focus of the article."
"BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investors in banks and fossil fuel companies, has been hired by the EU to work on potential new environmental rules for banks. Campaigners raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given BlackRock’s widespread financial interests in sectors that could be directly impacted by new environmental rules.  The European commission, the EU’s executive arm, said this week that BlackRock had beaten eight other bidders on a contract to study how the EU could best integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its banking supervision. BlackRock is the world’s largest investment manager, with $7.43tn (£5.97tn) in assets under management on 31 December, before the coronavirus pandemic caused a global market rout. The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world’s biggest companies. Analysis by InfluenceMap for the Guardian found that BlackRock in October controlled shares in fossil fuel companies worth $87.3bn that held 3.27bn barrels of fossil fuel reserves. BlackRock is a top-three investor in all eight of the world’s largest oil companies, and a top-10 investor in the 12 most systemically important banks in the world. Katrin Ganswindt, a climate and energy campaigner at Urgewald, a non-profit environmental and human rights organisation, said: “Appointing BlackRock as advisor to the European commission on environmental, social and governance factors seems a bit like letting the fox guard the henhouse. On top of being the world’s largest investor in fossil fuels, they are also among the leading global financiers of the weapons industry. “We are baffled as to why the European commission didn’t think there would be a massive conflict of interest with this choice.” The commission will pay BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) arm €280,000 (£244,000) for the study, according to a contract award notice published on the commission’s website – equating to only 1.3% of the $24m pay given to the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, in 2018, or 0.007% of the company’s $4.5bn operating profits in 2019. However, decisions made by European banking regulators on ESG issues could have significant financial effects on the companies whose shares BlackRock holds. For instance, looser restrictions on bank lending to companies fuelling the climate crisis could profit both oil companies and lenders. BlackRock itself has been strongly criticised for blocking progress on environmental issues. Guardian analysis of data from ProxyInsight found that BlackRock opposed or abstained on 82% of climate-related shareholder resolutions at the companies whose shares it managed between 2015 and 2019, far lower than many rivals. However, in 2020 the company has taken significant steps to make environmental sustainability a core part of its business. In January it said it would divest from companies that made 25% or more of their revenues from coal, as well as pledging to start using its voting power to force companies to disclose climate risks. A European commission spokesman said contract was awarded “in full and strict compliance with the applicable EU procurement rules, including those on the eligibility of tenderers and the prevention of any potential conflict of interest”. BlackRock’s tender was better than competitors, and it will form only one input in the EU’s policymaking, the spokesman added. A spokesman for BlackRock said its FMA arm functioned separately to the investment management unit. He said: “We are honoured that BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory has been selected to perform an analysis to inform the European commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, deploying our expertise and capabilities in advising public-sector clients on structural trends, including the transition to a low-carbon future.” • This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to the European commission’s suggested fee of €550,000. In fact, the fee paid to BlackRock will be €280,000."

The United Nations has outlived any usefulness it ever promised but could not deliver. It is now chock full of delegates who are anti-USA and anti-Israel who want to pillage the economic resources of the west through migration and climate change funding. 



1\. **Through migration.**



[ _Whaleoil_](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/thursday-nightcap-332/) posted a video interview by Mark Steyn with previous American presidential candidate Michele Bachmann about the American experience. Bachman **estimates 25% of the GDP of some Latin and South American countries comes from the United States**.



The United Nations use illegal migration as a tool to fulfil their agenda to redistribute western wealth. The notion of **using migrants to pillage western welfare** was a new concept to me.



 **The United Nations believes migration is beneficial** and are moving forward with legislation to promote legal migration, but Bachman talks about the economic benefits **illegal migrants also receive** from the United States.



“They [the UN] encourage people to come into the west – into the United States – because they know there will be immediate access to the welfare states.“



“Damn what our laws say. There will be immediate access to the welfare state and I’ve asked the presidents of Latin American countries, South American countries – what percentage of your GDP is from, ah remittances – money that is earned in the United States and sent back home.”



“And **for many of them a fourth of the entire GDP comes from remittances from the United States**. So, whether that’s from earnings – **legal or illegal** – or whether that’s from **welfare state remittances** , it’s coming from the US and it’s streaming out of our country.”



Steyn argues the money would be better directed into improving third world economies to remove the incentive of illegal migration to the US and points out that **non-Americans can easily remit funds overseas,** whereas Americans sending funds overseas would be “subject to IRS scrutiny for the next 20 years, but **apparently if you are non-American you can take money and send it anywhere** on the planet”.



In theory, disincentivising migration by improving third world countries sounds attractive. But in practice, passing funds through the hands of the corrupt governments responsible for economic failure in the first place is a huge, almost insurmountable hurdle.



Bachmann resides in Minnesota, home to the largest population of Somalis outside Somalia and home of the Somali state-funded childcare scandal that broke in 2018.



“So, a number of Somalis have set up day cares, whether it’s in their homes in businesses outside of their home, to such an extent that the ah, the number that’s being reported were that a hundred million dollars in a year’s time has transited through the Minneapolis St Paul airport, in cash, in roller bags, going to Somalia.



So, a hundred million in cash coming out of these day cares and so… because **Minnesota is the most generous welfare state of all 50 states.** There is nothing too good for… for the welfare recipients in Minnesota, by the tax payers of Minnesota.



We’ve made it so easy, in fact, that we have apps for smart phones for people who utilise this system, and so **a day care provider can sit and just ping this system for non-existent children in the day care – and that’s being done**. In fact there’s a story that one woman had left the United States with her roller bag filled with cash on her way to Somalia and she was sitting in an $800 a night hotel room in Nairobi pinging on the app, the Minnesota app, for more fake kids in her day care and we’re paying all this money.”



Bachmann alleges the funds were used for terrorist activity but Minnesota’s legislative auditor released a report this year that **confirmed “widespread child care assistance fraud** ” but failed to confirm a connection between the state’s Child Care Assistance Programme and al Shabab or other terrorists. This does not mean the connection does not exist, it just means the review could not find it. But the scam was expensive.



“Jay Swanson, the manager of the CCAP investigators, said he believed [**$100 million was roughly accurate**](https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2019/03/what-we-learned-from-the-audit-of-minnesotas-child-care-assistance-program-no-suitcases-full-of-cash-but-plenty-of-baggage/). But he also had an expansive view of fraud that goes beyond what is typically prosecuted in criminal proceedings. His attention focused on roughly 100 child care centers and he assumed lax supervision by employees was fraud, as well as overbilling. “Therefore, in Swanson’s opinion, all of the CCAP money paid to those centers in 2017 — approximately $108 million — should be counted as fraud,” the report says.”



2\. **Through Climate Change Funding**



“One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole,” said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015.



So, what is the goal of environmental policy?



 **“We redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy,”** said Edenhofer.



Helen Clark paved the way for successive NZ governments, including our sycophantic UN loving CoL.



[Nominations close this 28 July](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/deadline-approaching-climate-change-commission-nominations) for our very own “independent” Climate Change Commissioner who will ensure the UN agenda is closely adhered to.

Last weekend’s “three amigos” summit put President Obama’s trade identity crisis on full display. On the one hand, he praised open markets and again vowed to resist protectionist impulses. On the other hand, Obama’s Canadian and Mexican counterparts gave him an earful about US policies harming trade between the three nations.



Such is the state of US trade policy, and nowhere are Obama’s current problems more evident than in the Administration’s new trade enforcement initiative. Announced last month, the program bolsters the efforts of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to snoop in other nations’ closets and ferret out illegal restrictions to U.S. exports.



But while increasing foreign market access for U.S. goods and services is a laudable goal, until the United States gets its own (glass) house in order, the administration’s plans will be ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.



The White House’s new trade enforcement initiative can be whittled down to three “S“s: more searching, more shaming, and more suing. USTR has promised to expand its targeting of foreign barriers to U.S. exports, to increase diplomatic pressure on trading partners to remove these barriers, and, where diplomacy fails, to bring more cases to the World Trade Organization.



USTR Ron Kirk justified the decision to make trade enforcement a “centerpiece” of American trade policy on the fact that “we need access to foreign markets.” In that sense, he’s right: expanded market access for U.S. farmers, manufacturers and service providers is critically important to the future success of the U.S. economy. Ninety‐​five percent of the world’s consumers live outside America’s borders, and fledgling economies provide especially fertile ground for the seeds of U.S. business. Thus, efforts to ensure that other nations abide by their trading commitments and keep their markets open have been, and should continue to be, an important part of U.S. economic policy.



The United States has some very valid market access concerns. Mischief abounds in this difficult economic climate. But enforcement can only be a centerpiece of American trade policy when the United States meets its own international obligations. Why will countries respect America’s rights in the global trading system when we so commonly and brazenly disrespect their co‐​equal rights?



The quick answer: they probably won’t.



China probably won’t end its baseless restrictions on U.S. pork exports (supposedly to prevent the “swine flu”) while the U.S. maintains similarly groundless restrictions on Chinese poultry imports (supposedly to prevent the 2004 avian flu). Indeed, China has already filed a protest with the WTO over the chicken issue.



Canada probably won’t agree to better police its (allegedly) subsidized lumber market when the United States freely subsidizes its auto sector without regard to global trade rules, and confounds Canadian businesses’ ability to bid on U.S. infrastructure projects with indecipherable “Buy American” restrictions. In fact, Canadian municipalities have already responded with “Don’t Buy American” laws — hardly the ideal political environment for new U.S. enforcement demands.



South Korea probably won’t change onerous automobile emissions standards that keep American cars and trucks out of its market when the United States maintains a 25% tariff on foreign truck imports, sits on a U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement that was signed in 2007, and keeps Mexican trucks off of U.S. roads for equally dubious environmental reasons that have been found to violate NAFTA. (Not to mention those auto subsidies!)



Of course, when the diplomacy fails, there’s always litigation. But compliance with adverse rulings from the WTO — the only global body handling trade disputes between governments — is purely voluntary. Nations found to have violated global trade rules can accept retaliatory tariffs against their exports instead of opening their markets. The United States is a big believer in this “alternative,” refusing to implement multiple WTO rulings against its bloated agricultural subsidies, its biased antidumping law, and its discriminatory gambling restrictions. Of course, this non‐​compliance has serious costs to U.S. companies whose exports face new retaliatory duties, and to the consumers in those now‐​closed foreign markets.



Governments that the U.S. brings to the WTO are likely to follow in our footsteps. So after the administration’s new diplomacy fails and it resorts to WTO litigation, a “victory” in Geneva will most likely mean less market access around the world, not more. And the big losers will be American consumers.



The WTO also will lose out. Because the trade body has no enforcement powers, a fundamental motivation for nations to comply with adverse rulings is to maintain the integrity of the trading system. Non‐​compliance is supposed to be a last resort. So when the United States and other countries increasingly take this route, the system suffers.



In explaining the administration’s “new approach to trade,” USTR Kirk stated, “If they know we are holding a magnifying glass up to their actions, they’ll be less likely to break the rules.” Unless the Obama Administration first turns that magnifying glass inward, its new trade enforcement plan will be a failure — one that could harm American consumers, contract global trade flows and further marginalize the WTO.



That’s not a new approach worth taking.

"Ancient woodlands and flower-rich meadows have disappeared to make way for agriculture and urbanisation, but attempts are being made to reverse the decline using “green” farming projects. The question is, are they working? Known as agri-environmental schemes, under these farmers are paid to manage the land in ways that are more conducive to wildlife. They also bring benefits to the farm: encouraging species of birds and insects that control crop pests, and attracting more pollinators for flowering crops.  But trying to establish how effective these schemes are involves taking measurements by walking through fields – a laborious and time-intensive process that’s impossible to do on a large scale. Instead, we have found a way to recruit bees to do the work for us. Each of the tens of thousands of bees within a hive is a little information-gathering machine that flies, rather than walks, similar sorties through the fields on our behalf collecting information. A bee that has found a good source of nectar or pollen will tell her nestmates, and she does so by using “waggle dance” language, a figure-of-eight move that indicates to others the distance and direction from the hive of flower patches that are of value to them. Our research published in the journal Current Biology eavesdrops on this waggle dance communication between bees, so we can tell which areas they value for sources of nectar and pollen. Even though each bee knows only a fraction of the landscape, the colonies as a whole cover a lot of ground: bees from our study surveyed about 94km2. By combining the bees’ selected areas with the location of agri-environmental schemes we can establish which of those human efforts to improve the landscape impress pollinators. And what do the bees prefer? We need to account for how bees rank a source of food. For both pollen and nectar, we know that foragers’ willingness to dance for the source increases with the quality of the treasure, whether that’s sugar-concentrated nectar or the protein-rich pollen. The worker bees out collecting also consider the distance to the food: can they get sufficient food from the corner store to not warrant travelling to the large supermarket many kilometres away? After accounting for the time and energy spent flying several kilometres back and forth, a flower patch considered high quality if near the hive may make for a poor meal if located further afield. So we too had to take the distance into account in our analysis and counteract it by giving greater weight to dances that indicate locations at greater distances. The University of Sussex lies at the northeastern boundary of Brighton, so bees from the hives on campus have access to urban areas and open fields, and those fields that include agri-environment scheme areas. Perhaps the crown jewels in this landscape are Castle Hill National Nature Reserve to the southeast and Ditchling Beacon local nature reserve to the northwest.  After making allowances for distance, it turns out that the university campus bees ranked these first and second in preference. Overall, they preferred land managed under the UK agri-environmental schemes called Higher Level Stewardships, under which farmers set aside land and field margins on which to grow wildflowers and plants for the long term. Interestingly they seemed averse to land managed under another scheme, the Organic Entry Level Stewardships. So what do the bees choices tell us? The nature reserve areas most visited by bees are managed mainly to attract butterflies and moths, but as wildflower-rich chalk grasslands they are also attractive to honeybees. Clearly the conservation efforts pay off, as they provide pollinators with food which might be sparse in areas of more intensively managed rural lands.  The fact that bees prefer the nature reserves is proof that honeybee hives are capable of finding and indicating areas we suspect are good. The bees also liked some areas managed under agri-environmental schemes, which shows that the money given to farmers to manage their land with wildlife in mind is well spent – at least as far as bees are concerned. Hopefully, if our study is replicated at other locations we might learn more about which specific sets of plants or styles of land management benefit them most. Our study shows that bees, due to their large foraging range and ability to carefully evaluate the quality of food available are good indicators of landscape quality. Studying where honey bees forage can reveal where benefits can be had for other insect pollinators too. Watching the waggle dance could be used where building projects are underway, to ascertain the quality of land that may be lost. How useful is the land that might be lost to bees if the Thames Estuary Airport is built? Should we build that football stadium next to a nature reserve? Can the planting of flower-rich margins lessen our impact? Our method gives ecological consultants a tool to answer these and similar questions – we just have to listen to the bees."
"Boston has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities. Now Boston faces its most existential threat yet – the rising seas. Ironically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston’s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise – in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities. The economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis. “It is an unfortunate quirk of timing,” admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site. City authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 – a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston. The seeds of Boston’s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston’s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands. The core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline – a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world’s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, according to the World Bank. The sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide. Developers in Boston are attempting to stare down this challenge, however. Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated. But Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it – an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor’s first “living shoreline” – a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides. You get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor. Seawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown. “We’ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,” Iselin said. “In four or five years you’ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape. “I think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it’s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.” The developers haven’t left too much to chance – Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator. These adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible. A more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m. These new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the “perception of gentrification is very real”, Iselin conceded. Boston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis – its Climate Ready Boston plan sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms – but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements. The city has had one near miss – Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won’t be so lucky next time. “Where I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient – all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,” said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group the Harborkeepers who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. “The question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?” Originally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston’s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston’s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries. “Boston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants – Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,” Ayed said. “That’s still the case but it’s changing. I don’t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can’t. I probably won’t be able to ever afford it.” Ayed said that Lendlease “deserves a lot of credit” for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she’s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt. “The bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,” Ayed said. “The whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.” Boston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn’t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city’s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved. The task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America’s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground. “As we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,” said Christopher Cook, Boston’s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them. “Success is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can’t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won’t have been successful.” Even for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this? Big cities like Boston can muddle through a lot of these questions themselves but the vast US coastline faces a hopefully mismatched response to the swelling seas. There is no overarching federal government strategy to deal with sea level rise, a phenomena that’s on course to displace an astounding 13 million Americans, according to a University of Georgia in Athens study, with the Trump administration dismantling the few federal requirements to build with the climate crisis in mind. “The challenge is enormous, so much so that it could be paralyzing,” said Cook. “We’ve taken on challenges over time, though, and this is just the next stage in this. “But we do need strong federal leadership – frankly we needed it 10 years ago. Washington DC needs to focus on protecting coastal cities, because a lot of them don’t have the flexibility we do.” This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis December for much of Germany and Central Europe has been a pretty cold month so far, with lots of snow and cold weather. At least that was the case until this past weekend when a warm southerly air mass swept across Germany and elevated temperatures well above normal, just in time for Christmas.

Yesterday, Christmas Eve, the mercury climbed to 18.9 °C in Freiberg in southern Germany – a new national record for the date. Spiegel writes that it was even warmer in Munich – but unofficially:
The thermometer at one measuring station at the university showed 20.7 °C. However, the German Weather Service (DWD) pointed out on Tuesday that this was not one of its official measurement stations. The reading measured in Munich will not be included in the official statistics of the DWD.”
Yet that didn’t stop the media from running with the reading as if it were an official record. Everywhere they reported the unofficial 20.7°C reading as a new record. For example online weekly Die Zeit here reported the 20.7°C reading as if it had been an official high (and good enough to qualify for the Die Zeit “Science” section):
With 20.7°C, a national temperature record high for Christmas Eve was measured since the beginning of the instrumental record.”
Indeed it would be interesting if a reader photographed that unofficial university station. Who knows what heat sources may be nearby. And I guess the media think that the German Weather Service can be just ignored nowadays.

Once again Die Zeit demonstrates an overzealous tendency of not checking the facts before printing, read here. No matter, the unofficial reading, which had never been accepted by the German Weather Service, was good enough for the broader German mainstream media to declare as the new record – and yet another sign of man-made climate change.
Record cold in Russia claims over 120 lives
Not surprisingly, much of the media refuses to report on the record cold gripping Russia, Siberia and large swaths of Asia, i.e. an area thousands of times larger than the isolated southern regions of Germany.
Spiegel, however, covers the massive northern hemisperic cold here, with an online piece titled: “Record cold in Russia claims more than 120 lives”. Read latest Russian cold here!
To be fair, Die Zeit reports on the record cold in Russia, but buries the story in the “Weather” section. Real propaganda meisters they are. I had to use their “search” function to find it.
At Die Zeit, weeks of record cold over a large swath of the northern hemisphere, with hundreds of lives lost, is less newsworthy than one unofficial record warm day in the city of Munich.

"Can the world’s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis? With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years.  Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere. Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a $150m research and development program to build the reef’s resilience to future warming. Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: “It’s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years’ time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.” On its own, the project – called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program – is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef. It’s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they’re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder. Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs. The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation – it’s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches: Shading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures; Stabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification; Helping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse. So what’s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time? In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, led a trial of equipment that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air. The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets. The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds. Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below – perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching. Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress. Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: “It’s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach. “We are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.” Other methods under this “shading and cooling” category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas. “This is a race against time,” he said. “If we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris [climate] targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future – but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.” Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what’s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre. Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs. There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover. Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation. Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales. Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C “then there is so much we can do” across all the approaches. “It’s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,” he says. “At 3C the reef will look very different – it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn’t give up.” Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons. “It’s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,” he says. One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in “slicks” and drop them in places that need help to recover. Harrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, “it didn’t matter if 99% [of the larvae] drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.” “Because the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.” Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs. Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae. Combining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs “more scope for growth under warming conditions”. “We think we can get an increased tolerance [of corals] of just a few degrees. Ultimately, unless the political leadership round the world enables a realistic approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing the rate of climate change under control, the system will become so overwhelmed we won’t be able to use these corals. “We are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change. There’s a large group of people around me who feel we can’t wait for action. We have to work out what we can do now.”"

What are the police paid to do? An illegal roadblock is installed and the police leave it in place. A senior citizen removes it to go about his lawful pursuits and the protestors call the police. Madness!



A Redfield retiree ripped down an Extinction Rebellion blockade so he could drive through.



Brian Salt, 73, usually drops his friend Lynne Mattin off for her evening cleaning shifts at a barristers’ chambers in Broad Street without trouble.



But this week he encountered a road-block on Newgate when trying to drive his camper van to Ms Mattin’s workplace at 5.40pm.



Extinction Rebellion (XR) has closed the route with a banner and signs each day this week as part of a bid to raise awareness of the ‘climate emergency’.



Mr Salt says activists have repeatedly refused to let him pass each evening, meaning Ms Mattin, 65, has had to walk about a quarter of a mile to work.



“She was in tears from the pain,” Mr Salt said. “She has a false knee and she can’t walk long distances.



“I tried to tell them this but they didn’t listen. It’s disgusting. Any sympathy people might have had for the protesters is gone.”



He says things have “turned nasty” each time he has tried to get through, so he decided to “have a bit of fun” just before 8pm yesterday (July 17).



Mr Salt continued: “I tried to do it nicely and it didn’t work. So when I went back to collect Lynne after her shift, I ripped down the banner and moved the signs.”



He laughed as he recalled: “They were shouting, ‘Call the police, call the police.’ I told them it wasn’t a legal road closure.



“I will repeat it the next time I drive Lynne to work. I am quite willing to get arrested. I am open about it.”



Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Extinction Rebellion have been approached for comment.

How delicious! Mike is going to sue the gummint for climate change. They either agree with him and pay out or they argue that he is wrong on all counts – which he is – and have to admit that the whole thing is a charade.



The Treaty of Waitangi promised that the Government had a duty to actively protect Maori interests. One Iwi leader says that the impending catastrophe of climate change means they have failed to meet that standard.



Mike Smith, chair of the Climate Change Iwi Leaders Group announced on Tuesday that he was suing the Government because “the Crown is failing to protect all New Zealanders, but especially Maori, from catastrophic effects of climate change”.



“Maori are particularly vulnerable to climate change, being disproportionately represented amongst the poor, who will be the hardest hit,” he said.



Mike is right. The poor will be the hardest hit. Not by the climate crisis but by taxes and EV subsidies and higher electricity prices and ETS charges at the petrol pump and so on.



The Crown lawyers will have a hard job following the government logic of solving the climate crisis via ever-increasing taxes to offset something that is not happening while simultaneously arguing that these taxes are not going to impact the poor.



He said that traditional resources, including fisheries, would be affected by ocean acidification, and that flooding would damage coastal communities. 



There is no ocean acidification that is going to affect fisheries, but if the Crown lawyers argue that, they will have to get some truthful scientists to prove that the alarmist ocean acidification statements are nonsense. 



There is no flooding of coastal communities due to the climate crisis. Sea levels are rising 1-2 mm/year, as they have done for the last 100+ years of recorded measurement. But if the Crown lawyers get experts to argue that fact in court they will be undermining the climate emergency nonsense.



[…] He wants the courts to declare that the Crown will be in breach of duties owed to Maori unless it reduces total greenhouse gases by half by 2030, and to zero by 2050.



What a shame that Marsden, and the others who drafted the Treaty on behalf of the English and Maori in 1840, did not think to include in either version of the Treaty document an absolute limit on CO2 levels and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.



He filed proceedings in his personal capacity, citing the interests of all Maori.



The filing argues a breach of duty under the Treaty of Waitangi and the Bill of Rights Act. 



  
All power to you, Mike, I have my popcorn ready.

Candidate Barack Obama was widely seen as running on a peace platform. More recently President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace for supposedly offering a new international approach. Yet he is considering a major military escalation in Afghanistan.



Instead, the president should rethink Washington’s objective. The conflict has become his war. He should not ask, is Afghanistan winnable? Rather, the right question is what should the U.S. attempt to achieve? The goal should be to advance American security, not build an Afghan state.



The president need not rush his decision. Hawkish demagogues who entrapped the U.S. in an unnecessary war in Iraq hope to do the same in Afghanistan. For instance, Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R‐​Wyoming) claimed: “the lack of decisiveness about how to best proceed is emboldening our enemies and endangering our troops and friends.” The worst policy, however, would be to mimic the foolish decisiveness of President George W. Bush.





After eight years, Washington has not created the answer in Kabul.



Afghanistan was President Bush’s “good war,” in which Washington ousted the ruling Taliban for hosting al‐​Qaeda. But he quickly lost interest in Afghanistan, shifting Washington’s attention and resources to Iraq. Conflict in Afghanistan has raged for eight years–longer than the U.S. spent fighting World Wars I and II combined–consuming nearly 900 U.S. and 600 allied lives, as well as $220 billion. The Afghan people, too, have suffered greatly.



Yet “victory” looks ever more distant. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that the situation in Afghanistan is “deteriorating.” The government barely functions; drug money pervades the otherwise moribund economy. The number of estimated insurgents, Taliban attacks, and allied casualties all are rising. Barely a third of the territory can be said to be under the central government’s (very loose) control, and even large urban areas are no longer safe. Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s supporters engaged in ostentatious and widespread electoral fraud.



Indeed, the election imbroglio highlights the administration’s challenge. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel declared: “The result, for us and for the president, is whether, in fact, there’s a credible government and a legitimate process.” But that question has been answered–in the negative. The initial vote was marred by widespread irregularities; the fraudulently reelected president accepted a run‐​off only because the foreign military powers keeping him in power demanded one; no one imagines President Karzai losing even if Abdullah Abdullah reverses his decision to boycott the poll. A forced coalition/​national unity government would offer little more legitimacy.



President Obama termed the war one of “necessity” and in March added 21,000 combat troops to the 47,000 Americans already stationed in Afghanistan. (Another 37,000 allied, largely NATO, forces are on station, though often where they are not needed.) Now the president’s hand‐​picked commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, is pushing for upwards of 80,000 more personnel, with 40,000 apparently the “minimum” acceptable in his view.



The administration is worried about the political implications of escalation and is considering a compromise–adding some troops, but fewer than desired by Gen. McChrystal. However, pursuing expansive objectives without providing the necessary resources would be the worst policy. Commented _Washington Post_ columnist Eugene Robinson: “This game’s been going on for eight years. It’s time to raise or fold.”



But raising would not guarantee success. The allies initially deployed 60,000 personnel in Bosnia, a much smaller territory in which conflict had ceased. At its maximum Russia had 118,000 troops in Afghanistan, which proved to be too few. Even an extra 80,000 troops–which the U.S. does not have handy to deploy in Afghanistan–would not be enough. Under traditional counterinsurgency doctrine, Afghanistan, with 33 million people, many of them living in remote villages amidst rugged terrain, warrants 660,000 allied personnel. Nor is NATO reinforcement a realistic option. President Obama, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Gen. McChrystal all have pushed for more assistance, but garnered few commitments and even fewer boots on the ground. Europeans have far less stomach for continuing the war than do Americans.



The critical issue is Washington’s objective. The U.S. long ago achieved its goal of displacing and weakening al‐​Qaeda (despite the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden) and ousting the Taliban government which gave the organization refuge. That success persists despite recent Taliban gains. National Security Adviser James Jones estimated fewer than 100 al‐​Qaeda members are operating in Afghanistan, and said they have “no bases, no ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies.”



Ousting the Taliban was simple compared to creating “an effective and representative government,” in the words of Marin Strmecki, formerly at the Pentagon, or “a national representative government that is able to govern, defend, and sustain itself,” according to four scholars at the Center for American Progress, or “a credible Afghan partner for this process that can provide the security and the type of services that the Afghan people need,” in Rahm Emanuel’s words. Such a partner doesn’t currently exist and is no where close to existing.



Everyone uses the old adage that Afghanistan is the “graveyard of empires,” but outside powers never have had much success in imposing their will on the Afghan people. Nation‐​building is difficult enough: only in Germany and Japan, with ordered societies and democratic traditions, has the U.S. had unambiguous success. Third World states have proved largely impervious to Western attentions.



Afghanistan is no different. Afghanistan “worked” during the mid‐​20th century under a monarchy which understood the limits of its power. The regime respected the poor, traditional, autonomous tribal‐​based society which it purportedly ruled. And, most important, there were no foreign military occupiers.



Social engineering by Washington would be difficult in the best of circumstances. Afghanistan’s challenges are daunting. Observed the _Economist_ magazine: “The country’s mountains and deserts are forbidding; its tribal make‐​up bewildering; and, after three decades of war, its communities broken, poor and ignorant. Well‐​meant actions often have unintended effects: fighting can create more insurgents than it kills; foreigners are blamed for attacks that hurt Afghan civilians; and schemes to win people over can deepen antagonism.”



Afghanistan hosts 20 ethnic groups. Even the Pashtuns are divided into 50 tribes. This is not a society traditionally welcoming to outsiders, let alone foreigners. Afghanistan has become the world’s largest opium producer. Finally, Afghan society has been badly deformed by three decades of war.



After eight years, Washington has not created the answer in Kabul. Matthew Hoh, a former Marine Corps officer who recently resigned from the State Department, explained: “Like the Soviets, we continue to secure and bolster a failing state, while encouraging an ideology and system of government unknown and unwanted by its people.” Ralph Peters, a columnist who backed the Iraq war, criticized protecting “an Afghan government the people despise.”



The inadequacies of the Karzai regime are manifest and multiple. The International Crisis Group pointed to “a highly centralized constitutional order in which the legislature has been denied the tools to check an overbearing executive, and a neglected judiciary, which contributes to the climate of impunity and corruption fuelling the insurgency.” Malalai Joya, vilified by fundamentalists for daring to run for parliament and promote women’s rights, complained: “Your governments have replaced the fundamentalist rule of the Taliban with another fundamentalist regime of warlords.”



Then there is the recent flagrant election fraud, which, wrote Hoh, “will call into question worldwide our government’s military, economic and diplomatic support for an invalid and illegitimate Afghan government.” Karzai’s allies claim that the Afghan president has learned from the experience, but what has he learned? If he can get away with rampant fraud, whether or not a second poll is held, he likely will become even less tractable. U.S. escalation will be seen as support for the existing regime, not for the sort of idealized system Washington claims to support.



No intrinsic strategic importance justifies attempting to construct a genuine Afghan state. Boston University’s Andrew Bacevich explained: “No serious person thinks that Afghanistan–remote, impoverished, barely qualifying as a nation-state–seriously matters to the United States.” Afghanistan’s importance primarily derives from its impact on nuclear‐​armed Pakistan, whose largely ungoverned border territories provide a haven for both Taliban forces and what remains of al‐​Qaeda.



Blogger Paul Mirengoff contended that “Ceding Afghanistan to [America’s main] enemy would have serious adverse implications for Pakistan.” The _Washington Post_ worried: “success by the [Taliban] movement in toppling the government of either country would be a catastrophe for the interests of the United States and major allies such as India.” Others predict a veritable regional disaster if the U.S. withdraws.



However, a semi‐​stable, semi‐​workable Afghan state doesn’t necessarily work to Pakistan’s advantage. First, how would it affect Islamabad’s most serious security concern–the regional balance with India? Pakistan strongly supported the Taliban regime pre‐​9/​11 for a reason. Second, Afghans enjoying the benefits of peace might not welcome jihadists and terrorists, encouraging the latter to remain in Pakistan’s largely autonomous border provinces.



Most important, Pakistan seems more likely to be destabilized by an endless, escalating conflict than a Taliban advance. Islamabad’s vulnerabilities are obvious, with a weak civilian government facing a complex mix of poverty, instability, insurgency, and terrorism.



Unfortunately, the war in neighboring Afghanistan exacerbates all of these problems. Argued Hoh: “Our presence in Afghanistan has only increased destabilization and insurgency in Pakistan.” First, the war has pushed Afghan insurgents across the border. Second, cooperation with unpopular U.S. policy has reinforced the Zardari government’s appearance as an American toady. Ever‐​rising American demands further undercut Pakistani sovereignty and increase public hostility.



From Pakistan’s perspective, limiting the war on almost any terms would be better than prosecuting it for years, even to “victory,” whatever that would mean. In fact, the least likely outcome is a takeover by widely unpopular Pakistani militants. The Pakistan military is the nation’s strongest institution; while the army might not be able to rule alone, it can prevent any other force from ruling.



Indeed, Bennett Ramberg made the important point: “Pakistan, Iran and the former Soviet republics to the north have demonstrated a brutal capacity to suppress political violence to ensure survival. This suggests that even were Afghanistan to become a terrorist haven, the neighborhood can adapt and resist.” The results might not be pretty, but the region would not descend into chaos. In contrast, warned Bacevich: “To risk the stability of that nuclear‐​armed state in the vain hope of salvaging Afghanistan would be a terrible mistake.”



Washington is left with only bad options. One is to continue trying to “fix” Afghanistan. Gen. Stanley McChrystal argued: “A strategy that does not leave Afghanistan in a stable position is probably a short‐​sighted strategy.” Moreover, said Gen. McChrystal, American strategy must “earn the support of the people,” which will win the war “regardless of how many militants are killed or captured.”



Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations even suggested that “Poor governance is an argument for, not against, a troop surge. Only by sending more personnel, military and civilian, can President Obama improve the Afghan government’s performance, reverse the Taliban’s gains and prevent al-Qaeda’s allies from regaining the ground they lost after 9/11.” In short, failing to create a functional state after eight years of war means Washington should double down, pushing more lives and money into the growing pot.



America’s well‐​disciplined and well‐​trained forces can do much, but not everything. Hoh observed that no “military force has ever been tasked with such a complex, opaque and Sisyphean mission as the U.S. military has received in Afghanistan.” Even if better deployed in more heavily populated areas, the odds of reasonable success in reasonable time at reasonable cost seem long at best.



The point is not that the majority of Afghans love the Taliban. But many dislike the Karzai government, local warlords, and/​or allied forces. The costs of “winning” such a complicated game almost certainly would outweigh the benefits of even the most optimistic projections. As Peters bluntly states, “the hearts and minds of the Afghans not only can’t be won, but aren’t worth winning.” More likely than victory would be years of war, persistent insurgent activity, thousands more American casualties, hundreds of billions of dollars more outlays, persistent regional instability, and ultimate U.S. withdrawal.



What are the alternatives? The status quo offers little hope of reversing the Taliban’s gains. Concentrating allied troops in the cities might offer greater urban security but would concede most of the country to the insurgency. Accelerating training and equipping of the Afghan army and police would yield positive results only if the resulting forces proved to be competent and honest, as well as competently and honestly led.



The better policy would be for Washington to begin drawing down its combat forces. The outcome might be Taliban conquest and rule, but equally likely is continuing conflict and divided governance amongst competing political factions, ethnic groups, and tribes. The resulting patchwork would be tragic, but the fighting would no longer be inflamed by outside intervention.



Would adverse consequences extend beyond the region? The _Economist_ hyperbolically fears that “defeat for the West in Afghanistan would embolden its opponents not just in Pakistan, but all around the world, leaving it more open to attacks.” However, jihadists are most likely to attack Westerners when their grievances are ongoing. Groups based in Amman, London, Madrid, and Riyadh as well as America are more likely to act if the American government is killing more rather than fewer Muslims in Afghanistan.



Moreover, escalation, followed by additional years of conflict and then ultimate defeat would multiply the harm to America’s reputation. The Soviet Union made this mistake. Author Victor Sebestyen reviewed the minutes of meetings between Politburo and military officials and reported: “The Soviets saw withdrawal as potentially fatal to their prestige in the cold war, so they became mired deeper and deeper in their failed occupation.” Even reformist Mikhail Gorbachev dithered out of fear of the impact on Moscow’s image before finally withdrawing Soviet forces in 1989.



The most serious argument against withdrawal is that al‐​Qaeda would gain additional “safe havens.” Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute argued that “Afghanistan is not now a sanctuary for al‐​Qaeda, but it would likely become one again if we abandoned it.” Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration’s special envoy to South Asia, contended: “without any shadow of a doubt, al‐​Qaeda would move back into Afghanistan, set up a larger presence, recruit more people and pursue its objectives against the United States even more aggressively.” Preventing this is “the only justification for what we’re doing,” he insisted.



Yet there is no evidence that al‐​Qaeda has moved into territory currently governed by the Taliban. Even Taliban‐​controlled Afghanistan would not be a genuine safe haven. Noted Stephen Walt of the Kennedy School: “The Taliban will not be able to protect [bin Laden] from U.S. commandos, cruise missiles and armed drones. He and his henchmen will always have to stay in hiding, which is why even an outright Taliban victory will not enhance their position very much.”



Indeed, anti‐​terrorism expert Marc Sageman observed in recent congressional testimony: “there is no reason for al‐​Qaeda to return to Afghanistan. It seems safer in Pakistan at the moment.” Other options include other failed or semi‐​failed states, such as Somalia and Yemen. The defuse jihadist movement which has organized most of the terrorist plots since 9/11 has found adequate safe havens even in Europe.



No wonder Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations admitted, while calling for continuing “a war effort that is costly, risky and worth waging–but only barely so,” that preventing al‐​Qaeda from moving back into Afghanistan was “the weakest argument for waging the kind of war we are now waging.” The U.S. doesn’t have the resources necessary to wage war everywhere terrorists might conceivably seek a safe haven and need not do so in any case.



The administration should adjust its policy ends. Washington’s principal objective should be protecting U.S. security. The _Washington Post_ ’s David Ignatius railed against adopting “a more selfish counterterrorism strategy that drops the rebuilding part and seeks to assassinate America’s enemies.” But the U.S. government’s overriding obligation is to protect U.S. citizens, and that means focusing on al‐​Qaeda rather than the Taliban, forestalling and disrupting terrorist operations against America. Doing so requires sharing intelligence widely among affected nations, squeezing terrorist funding networks, utilizing Special Forces on the ground, employing predator and air strikes–judiciously, given the tragic risk of civilian casualties, which both raises moral issues and fuels anti‐​American sentiment–and cooperating with various Afghan forces and the Pakistani government.



In contrast, it is not necessary to build a functional state in Kabul allied with the U.S. Noted Sageman: “The proposed counter‐​insurgency strategy in Afghanistan is at present irrelevant to the goal of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al‐​Qaeda, which is located in Pakistan. None of the plots in the West has any connection to any Afghan insurgent group, labeled under the umbrella name ‘Afghan Taliban’.” In Afghanistan Washington should tolerate any regime or group, or combination of regimes or groups, willing to cooperate in preventing terrorist attacks.



Obviously, policymakers disagree on the likelihood of success of such a political strategy. One unnamed anti‐​terrorism official told the _Washington Post_ that the prospects of political reconciliation are “dim and grim.” Other analysts contend that only major battlefield victories would encourage Taliban forces to surrender.



Yet history suggests that accommodation is possible and certainly worth pursuing. After all, the Karzai government has made deals with warlords and narcotics producers alike. Washington once worked, reluctantly to be sure, with the Taliban regime to combat drug production. There are indications that the Taliban was angered by al-Qaeda’s 9/11 assault on the U.S. Moreover, a number of Taliban commanders defected in the early years after American intervention.



Thus, Washington should attempt to split the Afghan insurgency. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton once equated al‐​Qaeda and the Taliban, but more recently admitted: “Not every Taliban is an extremist ally.” In fact, the Taliban mixes hard‐​core militants and disaffected residents. Arsalan Rahmani, once Islamic affairs minister in the Taliban government and now a member of the Afghan parliament, explained: “Some are fighting to go to paradise, but among the Taliban leaders most want peace. Afghanistan is their homeland and they want peace here.”



The distinction is widely recognized. _Newsweek_ ’s Fareed Zakaria wrote: “It is unclear how many Taliban fighters believe in a global jihadist ideology, but most U.S. commanders with whom I’ve spoken feel that the number is less than 30 percent. The other 70 percent are driven by money, gangland peer pressure or opposition to Karzai.” Similarly, the _Boston Globe_ quoted an American intelligence official who contended that only ten percent of insurgents were Taliban ideologues, while “Ninety percent is a tribal, localized insurgency.”



Even Gen. McChrystal advocated going “pretty high up” to give even Taliban commanders “the opportunity to come in.” He added that Pashtuns “have always been willing to change positions, change sides. I don’t think much of the Taliban are ideologically driven; I think they are practically driven. I’m not sure they wouldn’t flip to our side.”



Washington will need to display both knowledge and nuance, admittedly too often in short supply, to exploit Taliban differences. However, being out of power apparently has left the Taliban even less well‐​disposed to bin Laden & Co. Explained John Mueller of Ohio State University: “There are reports that Omar’s group has made clear its rupture with al‐​Qaeda in talks with Saudi Arabia.”



Thus, the Taliban may well focus on its own interests. Mullah Mutawakkil, once a minister in the Taliban government, believes a deal is possible: remove bounties on commanders, release insurgent prisoners held at Bagram air base, and accept Taliban rule in Afghanistan’s southern provinces in return for a commitment not to allow use of Taliban‐​controlled territory in attacks on the West.



This would not be a radical policy, since Washington already has ceded certain areas to warlord control. Insurgent leaders know well that denial is less costly than control: Washington could launch targeted strikes against any al‐​Qaeda operations and oust any regime, Taliban or other, which allied itself with terrorists. This approach also would demonstrate to the Muslim world that the U.S. is targeting terrorists, not Islamic governments. In contrast, warns Mutawakkil: “If the Taliban fight on and finally became Afghanistan’s government with the help of al‐​Qaeda, it would then be very difficult to separate them.”



Currently joined with the Taliban are opportunistic warlords such as Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and Jalaluddin Haqqani. Washington should appeal to differences among uneasy allies and offer to buy off–or lease–the more venal opposition.



An essential aspect of this strategy, however, is withdrawing allied troops, since many Afghan fighters are determined to resist any foreign occupiers. A continuing occupation, no matter how well‐​intentioned from our perspective, will generate “more casualties, irritation and recruitment for the Taliban,” in the words of Nicholas Kristof.



In fact, the longer more U.S. forces remain, the harder more insurgents will resist. In 2007, for instance, 27 often feuding groups coalesced in Pakistan in response to U.S. airstrikes. In Afghanistan the population has not turned on the Taliban the way Iraqis turned on the al‐​Qaeda. Lt. Col. Daniel L. Davis, who served in both Afghanistan and Iraq, advocated a U.S. withdrawal over the next 18 months: “Many experts in and from Afghanistan warn that our presence over the past eight years has already hardened a meaningful percentage of the population into viewing the United States as an army of occupation which should be opposed and resisted.”



Unfortunately, there are limits to Washington’s ability to ameliorate this result. Argued Hugh Gusterson, of George Mason University: “The Pentagon will try to minimize the insult through cultural sensitivity training and new doctrines that emphasize befriending the locals, but they will fail because it’s in the very nature of counterinsurgency that occupying forces must be intrusive to be effective. And when you have thousands of foreign troops being shot at, accidents and atrocities happen. The more such troops you have, the more accidents and atrocities you get.”



There remains the emotional case for escalation. Army Sgt. Teresa Coble complained to the _Washington Times_ : “We would not be honoring the lives of the troops who died if we left here without finishing our mission.” But what is the mission? One should mourn those whose lives were sacrificed by their government for any policy which failed. However, al‐​Qaeda has been largely defanged. The failure to create an Afghan nation is one of policy, not personnel. It would not honor American servicemen and women to needlessly toss away even more lives to continue this failed policy.



It would be especially foolish to embark upon a campaign of escalation if it is not sustainable over the long‐​term. And escalation is not. After nearly eight years of war, the American people are losing faith–not in the necessity of killing or capturing terrorists, but in the dream of remaking Afghanistan. The latest CNN poll indicates that six of ten Americans oppose sending more troops to Afghanistan. Nearly half want to reduce manpower levels or even withdraw all troops. A majority also believes that Afghanistan has turned into another Vietnam.



Advocates of years more of costly war for dubious gain argue that the public _should_ support their policy, but that is irrelevant. The president must base U.S. policy on what the public likely _will_ support. Else his strategy will be doomed from the start.



In 2002 Barack Obama warned against fighting a war “without a clear rationale and without strong international support,” and that an invasion of Iraq would yield: “a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, and with unintended consequences.” That is happening in Afghanistan. In fact, one could imagine bin Laden hoping to ensnare the U.S. in a no‐​win war in Afghanistan. Seth Jones and Martin Libicki of the Rand Corporation noted that “combat operations in Muslim societies” are “likely to increase terrorist recruitment.” Indeed, parody has become truth. “Reported” the _Onion_ : “According to sources at the Pentagon, American quagmire‐​building efforts continued apace in Afghanistan this week, as the geographically rugged, politically unstable region remained ungovernable, death tolls continued to rise, and the grim military campaign persisted as hopelessly as ever.”



Of course, the desire of many Washington policymakers to improve the lives of Afghans is genuine. Most Afghans want peace and many Afghans desire American aid to better their land. Given enough resources and time, courageous and dedicated U.S. personnel could conceivably succeed in remaking Afghanistan. But the chances are slim while the cost in lives and treasure inevitably would be high–too high.



Getting out of Afghanistan won’t be as easy as getting in. The administration should develop a strategy to steadily reduce rather than increase America’s military presence. Combat forces should be fully withdrawn. The U.S. should focus on counter‐​terrorism. The time and manner of getting out should reflect potentially changing circumstances. But withdrawal should be Washington’s ultimate objective.



An independent America was born of a rugged determination by common folk to govern themselves. It should not surprise modern Americans that many Afghans feel the same way. Despite the persistent delusion in Washington that the rest of world desperately desires to become America’s next attempt at social engineering, most Afghans are not waiting for U.S. advisers, diplomats, and soldiers to show them a better way. To the contrary, many are ready to fight to follow their own way.



Their determination presents the president with a momentous decision. The administration should narrow the Afghan mission. Washington’s objective should be disrupting al‐​Qaeda wherever located, whether Afghanistan, Pakistan, or elsewhere. On occasion that will warrant military action, but more often other tools will be required. Even with the finest military on earth the U.S. government cannot do everything. Reconsidering American strategy in Afghanistan is an important way for Washington policymakers to acknowledge the limits of U.S. power. Changing American priorities in this way would be a giant step by President Obama towards actually earning a Nobel award bestowed more out of future hope than past achievement.

The Green Party published an advert mocking Simon Bridges and his accent.



The Green Party has deleted an ad attacking Simon Bridges because its members were not happy.  
The ad paints National Party leader Bridges as a used car salesmen at “Simon’s Imports”, using old footage of the National Party leader dubbed by an impersonator highlighting Bridges’ thick accent. 



Hey, I know that many of you don’t like Simon Bridges and that you think he is weak and ineffectual. But isn’t the Green Party the party of the moral high ground? The party that doesn’t get involved in gutter politics? The party that always plays the ball, not the man? **The party that always treats its fellow members in the House with respect,** even if they don’t agree with them?



Yeah, right.



“Oh look, do you like cars, I like cars,” it begins, before mocking Bridges’ climate change policy and low poll ratings.  
 **“Prices are down, emissions are down, my polling is down,” the video says, in the style of a car advertisement.**



Disgraceful. 



Bridges said the ad was amusing and it showed National’s attacks on the [Government’s feebate](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/114068301/government-proposes-massive-feebate-car-scheme-that-would-make-cleaner-cars-up-to-8k-cheaper-and-dirtier-cars-more-expensive) scheme to lower emissions were working.   
“The reality is, we’re holding the Government to account on their taxing of New Zealanders, they’re holding me to account on my accent”.  
He drew attention to the fact Labour [had also rolled-out its first attack ads](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/114424810/jacinda-ardern-remains-relentlessly-positive-despite-negative-facebook-ad-about-simon-bridges) since the election this Parliament.   
**Green Party co-leader James Shaw, who authorised the ad said other people hadn’t found the ad as funny as him.**



Good on Simon for taking it in his stride. I really don’t like the Greens, but James Shaw is the one that everyone holds up as the good guy. Well, he just lost that title as well.



Earlier on Tuesday, he told media the ad highlighted National’s own negative campaigning in a funny way.   
Shaw said it used humour to call attention to National’s ads, which he likened to those used by Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 US Presidential election.   
“We’re being meta about it,” he said.   
**Shaw said the party was not trying to mock Bridges’ accent.**



Errr… yes, you were James. How could you be doing anything else?



 **“We had to hire an actor who could accurately depict his accent,” he said.**  
His fellow co-leader Marama Davidson said the ad was “quite funny”, and agreed the party was not trying to mock Bridges’ accent. 



But you hired an actor who could accurately depict his accent…



The nastiness of this government continues. In the meantime, watch out for another puff piece about our Dear Leader tomorrow. There is a poll due out this weekend.

"**The mayor of Leicester has apologised for ""an error of judgement"" after it was revealed he broke lockdown rules twice by visiting his partner.**
Sir Peter Soulsby admitted visiting Lesley Summerland and staying at her house overnight before government guidelines allowed it.
The Sun on Sunday published pictures of the former Leicester South MP fitting a window to Ms Summerland's home.
Sir Peter said ""far more influential people"" had flouted the lockdown rules.
At the beginning of lockdown, England's deputy chief medical officer warned against partners living in separate households meeting up.
For that reason, Dr Jenny Harries said couples might wish to consider testing ""their strength of feeling"" and moving in together during lockdown.
However, Sir Peter, a 71-year-old Labour politician, said that would not have been practical as he was continuing to work and his partner of five years needed to be ""available to support her family"".
The widower said the couple had been separated for five weeks but then ""Lesley became ill"" with a recurring condition that was not related to coronavirus.
He said he spent three nights at her home at the end of April - the peak of the pandemic so far in the UK.
He spent a further four nights to ""secure the property"" by fixing a window at the front of her house in May.
Speaking to BBC Radio Leicester, he said he apologised for the error of judgement and admitted ""it was setting a very bad example"".
However, he added: ""I don't think anybody would claim that there was anything in my behaviour that ran any risk whatsoever of spreading the virus.
""It can be certainly interpreted as against the spirit of the lockdown, if not against the regulations.""
He said he had been ""ready to apologise"" unlike ""some of the high-profile people who are far more influential in setting policy about this than I am"".
In March, Sir Peter reiterated government advice by telling residents to stay at home and only go to work if their job was considered essential.
Leicestershire Police said officers spoke to Sir Peter at a police station yesterday and ""advice was given in relation to the government guidelines"".
The force said since the allegations related to potential historical breaches of lockdown restrictions, no further police action would be taken.
It said the decision was ""in keeping"" with how any report of a historical breach would be dealt with.
Leicester Conservatives described Sir Peter's breach of the regulations as ""clear hypocrisy"" and called on councillors and MPs to demand his resignation.
City councillor Lindsay Broadwell, Labour, also tweeted: ""This merits a resignation in my book.""
Sir Peter said he hoped his fellow councillors did not ""rush to judgement"".

"**A business is hoping to revamp hundreds of used bikes to be given as Christmas presents to children of families hit by the coronavirus pandemic.**
The family-run Staffordshire Waste Recycling Centre has given away about 60 cycles since setting up its recycle project, Bikes for Life, this month.
Phil Preece, from the Stoke-on-Trent firm, said: ""It is a joy when you see a child come and select a cycle.""
His son Calvin added the city had been ""hard hit"" by the pandemic.
""It is not a wealthy area and obviously now being stuck in tier three is really going to put demands on people,"" he said.
He was ""shocked"" by the poverty in the city when he saw people ""queuing up for food parcels"" when the firm helped community group Middleport Matters deliver food earlier this year.
""It's heartbreaking really,"" he said.
""I've got children myself and I would hate to think that I couldn't get them a bike, but some children will get nothing this year.""
He hoped the project, which will also donate bikes to adults and scooters, will ""carry on"" into 2021.
They have also had requests from about 20 children's homes, charities and refuges and hope to donate 600 bikes by Christmas.
About 180 bikes have been donated so far with most needing ""a few bits and bobs done"" or a clean-up, he said. Many had been left in garages after children had outgrown them.

by Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Germany’s Energiewende [energy transition over to renewables] is being watched closely in foreign countries. Already bets are being made on whether the expensive experiment is going to work. Meanwhile increasing numbers of international experts are expressing serious doubts. In the March 20th print edition of German national daily Die Welt, Daniel Wetzel reports on a survey by the World Energy Council in an article titled “The Energiewende is an international flop”. An online version of the report is now available and bears the watered down title: “Other countries disdaining the Energiewende”:
Worldwide doubt about the success of the German Energiewende is growing. International experts are sure that the German economy is weakening. This is the finding of a survey from the World Energy Council. […] A rapid short-term shutdown of nuclear power plants along with unlimited subsidies for renewable energies: In Germany this has been viewed as the silver bullet for energy policy since the Fukushima accident. However in Europe and globally, there’s hardly a nation that views the German ‘Energiewende”’ as worth copying. These are the findings of the German section of the World Energy Council in 23 member countries, made exclusively available to Die Welt. […] The rising doubt is possibly related to the unexpectedly rapidly rising electricity prices in Germany, which are having a dissuasive effect. Stotz believes: ‘Obviously one has to be able to afford an energy transition.’ (Read more at Welt Online).

In a commentary appearing at Die Welt titled, “Germany, the odd one out”, Daniel Wetzel pleads for more prudence, and rejects climate alarmism as the most important argument for an Energiewende:

Also the necessity to rapidly end the use of fossil fuels no longer appears as urgent as it was just a few years ago. Indeed, in the meantime, fear of climate change appears to have evaporated worldwide. Global warming has been taking a break for over 10 years, and politicians in many countries appear as if they would rather await a good explanation for this phenomenon before again making the fight against climate change a high priority. Quite apart from this: one other large industrial country has just succeeded in reducing its per capita CO2 emissions to levels of the early 1960s. The best in the class when it comes to climate politics is the USA. Thanks to fracking technology in natural gas drilling, they have been able to switch off dirty coal power plants.”

There are no clouds in the central Oregon sky today, but we are nonetheless living in dim times. With active wildfires on all sides of my home, we have some of the worst air pollution in the world.



It’s hard not to feel apocalyptic right now. In just four days, around 3 percent of western Oregon has burned, destroying hundreds of homes and other structures and forcing 80,000 people to evacuate. The good news is that it was not 500,000 people as reported in the media, but still, 80,000 is a lot, and many no longer have homes to return to.



I’ve been monitoring wildland fire policy for more than two decades, and this is the worst I have lived through. Still, this is far from a record year: though there have been lots of fires in the Northwest and northern California, fires are below average in southern California and much of the rest of the country.



One reason why we have seen bigger fires in recent years is that the Forest Service and other agencies have changed their firefighting tactics. For example, the Beachie Creek Fire near us was started by lightning on August 16. Located in a steep, inaccessible part of the Willamette National Forest, it smoldered on about 10 acres for ten days or so, then slowly increased over the following ten days to around 775 acres, then blew up, burning 132,000 acres in one ten‐​hour period–meaning it torched three acres per second–destroying hundreds of homes and killing at least two people.



A few decades ago, the Forest Service would have dropped smokejumpers by parachute on August 16 or 17 and had them directly attack the fire. But too many burnovers killing entire crews has rightly made the agency more protective of the lives of on‐​the‐​ground firefighters. Instead, it risks the lives of helicopter and air tanker pilots, five of whom have already died this year, having them dump water and fire retardant on the fires. During three weeks, they spent well over a million dollars doing this on the Beachie Creek Fire with dubious results.



Even when fires don’t escape, the tactics today emphasize indirect attack, meaning backfires, instead of direct attack. The result is that far more acres are burned, many of them lit by the firefighters themselves. Thus, based on acres burned, we can’t really draw conclusions about whether climate change or other factors beyond our control is resulting in more fires.



There are several major schools of thought about fire policy. One is that climate change has made fires worse and so we need to stop using fossil fuels and completely change our lifestyles to reverse this. I don’t buy this, as both the historic and prehistoric record (using things like soil profiles and tree ring analysis) indicate that an average of about 1 percent of the West has burned every year for thousands of years. After accounting for changes in firefighting tactics, I don’t see any indication that more acres are burning today because of climate change.



(On the other hand, and contrary to many climate‐​skeptic web sites, we can’t use the historic fire record to conclude that climate change isn’t happening either. The record shows that far more acres burned in the 1930s and 1940s than in the last few decades. What the record doesn’t say is that, in those years, the Forest Service opposed prescribed burning, which was widely practiced in the South, so it spitefully counted all acres of prescribed burning as wildfires.)



A second school of thought is that the 75 percent reduction in federal land timber sales between 1990 and 2000 is the problem, and if only we could increase timber cutting the forests would be healthier. The difficulty with this view is that timber cutting actually leaves forests more vulnerable to fire as it removes the big wood that isn’t very flammable and brings the fine wood and needles down from high in the air to the ground, where it is very flammable.



A third school of thought is that more than a century of fire suppression has allowed fuels to build up in the forests, making them more vulnerable to fire. This school calls for widespread fuel treatments, either physically removing the brush and small trees or burning them in place. In fact, wildland firefighting was never successful enough to have a significant impact on forest fuels. A Forest Service report several years ago concluded that the vast majority of western forests have not been ecologically changed by fire suppression.



The Forest Service currently spends $430 million a year on fuel treatments and Department of Interior and state agencies spend even more. Yet all the fuel treatments in the world aren’t going to save your house if firebrands from a lightning‐​caused fire seven miles away are blown by 50 mile‐​an‐​hour winds to your cedar‐​shake roof, which is what happened to many homes in Oregon last Monday.



My own view is that people in the West have to recognize that we live in a fire zone where roughly 1 percent of the natural landscape is going to burn each year no matter what we do. Instead of blaming these fires on public or private forest managers, we need to take responsibility to protect our own property and not rely on the Forest Service or other adjacent landowners to protect us.



That means the roofs and other parts of our our homes and other structures must be made of fireproof materials such as asphalt shingles, not cedar shakes. The walls can be wood, but our landscaping needs to follow defensible space or firewise principles so that, if it catches fire, it won’t generate enough heat to light structures on fire. The homes themselves should be at least 100 and preferably 150 feet apart so that, if one catches fire, the radiant heat from that fire doesn’t light up its neighbors.



Research by Forest Service fire scientist Jack Cohen has shown that such defensible space is both necessary and sufficient to protect structures from wildfire. It’s necessary because all the prescribed burning in the world won’t save your home if a burning ember from a lightning‐​caused fire 8 miles away lands on your lovely cedar‐​shake roof. It’s sufficient because it will protect your home even if neighboring forest landowners don’t do any prescribed burning or other fuel treatments at all.



This also means changing land‐​use policies adopted in California and other western states that promote dense housing. Urban‐​growth boundaries and zoning codes that mandate numerous homes on each acre even on urban fringes are asking for those homes to burn in wildfires. Cities need a buffer of low‐​density homes on one‐​acre lots to protect them from wildfires, and the lack of such a buffer is one reason why so many homes in Napa and other northern California counties have burned in the last few years.



If all homes and other structures in the wildland‐​urban interface met defensible‐​space standards, much of the $430 million that the Forest Service spends each year on hazardous fuels would not be needed, nor would much of the $2.5 billion or more that it spends on fire suppression.



Incidentally, the evacuation of 80,000 Oregonians should also alert transportation planners of the importance of having a good road network. Too many states and cities are trying to reduce road capacities. It’s called a “road diet” and it makes key evacuation routes unnecessarily congested. In 2018, a road diet in Paradise, California was blamed for the deaths of several people who were burned in their cars when they were stuck in traffic.



Before the Beachie Creek Fire blew up, the Forest Service posted a photo of two agency employees watching helicopters ineffectually dump water on the fire. The photo was titled “A Teachable Moment.” I hope the lesson we learned is that we need to take care of our own property and not depend on the government to protect us from natural wildfires that are beyond anyone’s control.

"The state of the British summer has always been a constant source of fascination and irritation, if only for its fickle nature. Now the latest prediction is for more heavy summer downpours. Our study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows the first evidence that summer downpours in the UK could become heavier with climate change. We used a very high-resolution model more typically used for weather forecasting to study changes in hourly rainfall. Unlike current climate models, this has a fine resolution and is able to realistically represent hourly rainfall, so this allows us to make these future projections with some confidence.  What we found was that summers are likely to become drier overall by 2100, in a warming climate. But our results suggest that when it does rain, it will be heavier in short outbreaks. In particular, intense rainfall with the potential to cause serious flash flooding (more than 30mm in an hour) could become a more common occurrence, increasing in frequency by several times. What the study provides is a much more complete picture of how UK rainfall may change in the future. Climate models generally work at coarse resolutions, using grids of around 12km square or larger. These have been able to accurately simulate winter rainfall, which generally comes from sustained, long-lasting periods of rain from large-scale weather systems. These models point toward wetter winters, with the potential for greater daily rainfall in the future. But summer weather is harder to predict using such coarse models. It is changes on an hourly basis that are important, as rainfall tends to come in short but intense bursts during the summer – as seen during the Boscastle flooding of 2004 and “Toon Flood” in Newcastle in 2012. So far climate models have lacked the resolution to accurately simulate the smaller-scale convective storms (intense showers formed by rising air) which cause this type of rain. To deal with this issue, our study uses the most high-resolution model ever used before in long climate simulations to examine rainfall change, based on a 1.5km square grid (the same as the UK Met Office Weather Forecast model), leading to much higher accuracy. We ran this model to simulate two 13-year periods, one based on the current climate and one based on the climate at the end of the century under a high-emissions scenario (the IPCC’s RCP8.5 scenario). The simulations were so computationally intensive that it took the Met Office’s supercomputer – one of the world’s most powerful – about nine months to run the simulations, and even then we could only run the model for the southern half of the UK, about as far north as Manchester. The simulation showed increased hourly rainfall intensity during winter, consistent with the simulations for the future provided by coarser resolution models and previous studies looking at changes on daily timescales. However the finely grained model also revealed that short-duration rain will become more intense during summer, something that the coarser model was unable to simulate. This finding is of major importance due to the potential for flooding: a threshold of 30mm per hour is used by the Met Office and Environment Agency Flood Forecasting Centre as guidance to indicate likely flash flooding, and our results suggest this may be exceeded more often (up to five times) and over a wider area in the future. Our findings are only the results of one climate model and we need to wait for other centres to run similarly detailed simulations to see whether their results support these findings. However, an increase in summer storms in a warmer, moister environment is consistent with theoretical expectations, and with the limited observational studies we have of hourly rainfall to date. This work is part of the joint Met Office and NERC-funded CONVEX project. The next steps are to see if the results are consistent with observations and predictions of hourly rainfall from climate models in other parts of the world, to be undertaken by the European Research Council-funded INTENSE project jointly run by Newcastle University academics in collaboration with the UK Met Office and other leading international scientists."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week’s newsstand, print-edition of FOCUS magazine (February 25, 2013, No. 9/13) has a 2-page interview with leading German climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch (HvS) titled: Climate Scientist Against Panic Spreading.

Hans von Storch
The sub-heading of the FOCUS article on page 92 reads:
Scientist Hans von Storch goes hard in his own way: He accuses climate science of hype and ‘methodical failure’.”
Here he is speaking about the IPCC scientists. The interview coincides with the official release of his latest book “Klimafalle“, which will hit the bookshelves tomorrow.
HvS says the focus of the climate issue is too much on the alarmists and those who claim it’s all humbug. His book attempts to move the discussion to the centre.
There’s little doubt that man-made CO2 emissions have caused the globe to warm since the industrial revolution, he tells FOCUS, but not all scientists say sea levels are going to rise 2 meters by the year 2100 and that hurricanes are getting more frequent.
He says the climate issue needs to be debated, and warns scientists against acting like they are the “keepers of the truth”.
At the center of the magazine’s 2-page spread are two juxtaposed images: the left one shows the divergence between the observed global mean temperature and the IPCC projections; the right image shows Chancellor Angela Merkel with Prof Han-Joachim Schellnhuber standing in the background. The text under the juxtaposed images reads “indeed the global mean temperature has stagnated for years” and that HvS’s book Die Klimafälle “criticises the alarmist view of the PIK” (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research).
HvS has always been critical of scientists interfering in the political process. FOCUS asks HvS if Chancellor Merkel ought not have a climate advisor, to which HvS replies:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Just a single advisor? No.”
FOCUS then asks HvS about efforts by scientists to intimidate any media critical of alarmism, a practice Stefan Rahmstorf is infamous for:
That is a not taking one of the most important institutions seriously, namely the media. Anyone who behaves like that obviously views himself as the judge who knows how media reporting is supposed to be.”
FOCUS then describes the IPCC’s embarrassing Himalayan error, asking HvS how it is that some scientists can claim to be infallible? HvS attributes it to a “circle-the-wagons mentality” within the climate science community, and even blames the political discussion in the USA “which has a very aggressive skeptics’ scene that extends all the way into Congress and has influence on policy-making.”
On the 15-year temperature stagnation, HvS still does not believe it disproves in the AGW theory, but concedes:
As the scientific community, we were just not prepared for the temperature not rising for a decade as CO2 concentrations rose. We had not thought enough about the possibility of falsification. […] We concentrated too much on looking ahead and said: Great! Everything fits our explanation. For many colleagues asking questions was frowned upon because this ‘could provide the climate skeptics with ammo‘. And that is a methodical failure.”
On Mojib Latif’s prediction that Central Europe would soon hardly see snow, HvS says criticism of the models here by skeptics is “completely legitimate” and adds:
Us climate scientists oversold. We said we had to announce the basic truth, and not to overload the people with too many details. Thus the problem arose because climate science did not understand its own role.”
In summary, HvS, a warmist, is calling for a fundamental correction in the way climate science goes about its business.
But one ought not think that HvS criticizes only the alarmists, he has plenty of criticism for the skeptics in his book as well.

When the elites are all singing from the same hymn sheet is precisely the time when ordinary folk should be turning their bullshit detectors right up to 11. “Conventional wisdom” was not coined as a positive description. Instead, as Mark Twain put it, “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect”.



The same roster of elite finger-waggers and tub-thumpers who regularly flock together in a squawking mass, to tell the rest of us what to think about gay marriage, Brexit, Trump and climate change are congealing once again to try and browbeat Australians into bowing to their superior morality and wisdom on the issue of constitutional recognition and an “Indigenous Voice” to parliament.



Not everyone, least of all among Aboriginal Australians, is buying it.



However, before we debate how, and in what form a ‘Voice’ might be implemented, we need to discuss some important aspects.



The first matter of concern, who was representing me when the all big decisions were being made?



Suspiciously, the very people who are advocating for this dangerous and all-encompassing change were the ones to hand-pick some pet “advisers”.



Going back to 2017 when the First Nations National Constitutional Convention was held at Uluru, the representatives in attendance were invited by nominees of the Referendum Council; and not elected by Indigenous people.



Much of the media attention has ignored the fact that there were and still are dissenting – and unheard – Indigenous voices throughout the entire process…



Well, that’s just silly. Everyone knows that all Aboriginal people think alike, and – purely coincidentally – agree with everything the inner-city green-left says.



Secondly, for far too long Aboriginal people have been portrayed as being one homogenous group of people who all think the same…We don’t have one voice and we never have.



Aboriginal Australia was never a single, united “nation”, but a patchwork of clans, tribes and language groups, all alternately allied or hostile to their neighbours, and all with their own agendas.



To try to put them all in the one basket and to treat them as if they are all the same is a grotesque denial of their rights to see themselves as different and distinct linguistic and cultural groups, with their own distinct histories of contact with Europeans and experience of colonisation.



We would not want to send Tiwi and Warlpiri to Tasmania to sort out their problems for them and we wouldn’t expect Palawa to come to the NT to sort out the problems of remote communities. Each of these groups are the only ones who can solve their own problems in their own unique way.



As journalist Stan Grant has acknowledged, being asked to “identify” as “Indigenous” is being asked to effectively disown half of his family. Enshrining such racial division in the constitution means awarding some family members more or fewer rights than others, purely on the basis of the identity they choose.



And what of our non-Indigenous loved ones and relatives. A clear majority of those who identify as Indigenous now have children with those who don’t. In the southern cities of Sydney and Melbourne, over 80% of Indigenous people are coupled with non-Indigenous partners and have children. Roughly the same percentage of their children identify as Indigenous.



Do our non-Indigenous loved ones have no say in the future of their own children and grandchildren?



There is also the glaring issue of the corruption and mismanagement that plagued previous “Indigenous Voice” organisations like the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, disbanded by bipartisan agreement in 2005. Even today, the lion’s share of “indigenous” funding flows to oddly pale-skinned city dwellers while remote communities remain squalid hell-holes.



Thirdly, as Indigenous people, we all know that those with powerful positions within our communities tend to have most of the resources and most of the control. Those who have managed to take advantage of the plentiful resources available in the Aboriginal industry have done so without effecting much change for the most vulnerable.



Do we imagine that a ‘Voice’ will empower the marginalised or will it entrench those who already maintain control of the resources that flow into Aboriginal disadvantage?…Will yet another bureaucracy such as a legislated ‘Voice’ simply give more power to those who haven’t yet demonstrated that they can solve the critical issues our marginalised Australians are faced with?



  
Or is that actually the point?

It just doesn’t get any better than this. The Occupy Wall Street Mob had a “Climate Justice Day” scheduled for today. I don’t think they figured on a “Nightmare on Wall Street” irony like this.

I notice Bill McKibben isn’t there. Strange how he talks a big game about climate and weather events becoming more extreme, but when the going gets tough… well you know. No mention of this comedic slap in the face by nature on the 350.org website.
Here’s the record statement from NOAA/NWS:

"**The government has been criticised over its decision to make the North East of England subject to tier three measures.**
Bars and restaurants will stay closed and can only serve takeaways when the national lockdown ends on 2 December.
Darlington Council leader Heather Scott said it would be difficult to move into tier two within a fortnight, due to week-old data being used to assess Covid rates.
The government said the restrictions were ""essential"" to control the virus.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he understood why people were ""frustrated"" but defended the decision, saying it would drive down the virus until a vaccine is available.
A review will be carried out on 16 December.
""While we were informed... they would look at the numbers once a fortnight, the data is actually a week behind,"" Ms Scott told BBC Radio Tees.
""We only received our tests yesterday [Thursday] so we have got to roll those out and the data will be taken from next week.""
She said she would be delighted if they could get into tier 2,North East tier 3 decision criticised but it will be very difficult.
Hartlepool Council leader Shane Moore said local leaders should have been consulted.
""I think it's disappointing but not a surprise and it's not a surprise because government ministers were itching to put us into tier three before the lockdown, but the difference there was local leaders had a bit of a say in the matter and we were pushing back on it,"" he said.
Joe Franks, owner of The Open Jar restaurants in Norton and Hartlepool, said it was ""another negative result"" for the hospitality industry.
While he praised support during the first lockdown, such as the furlough scheme which has been extended until March 2021, he felt the industry was being ""hung out to dry"".
""We class ourselves as one of the cleanest places to go,"" he said.
""Tables get wiped down - that's not because of Covid, that's just what restaurants have done, since restaurants have been restaurants.
""When was the last time you saw someone walking around Tesco wiping trolleys down to use before all of this was going on?""
Mr Franks called for more support to help businesses which would be unable to open under the new tier system.
A government spokesman said a ""wide-ranging package of financial support worth Â£280bn"" was in place nationally to help firms over the next few months.
He added: ""We understand the pressure businesses are currently under, particularly the hospitality industry. These restrictions, which are reviewed every 14 days, are essential so we can control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives.""

"The Covid-19 epidemic is ravaging our tattered healthcare system and shredding our economy. In the past month, over 22 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, compounding the fear that unemployment could breach 32% absent massive public action. This is an unmitigated human disaster, recalling the horrors of the Great Depression. And it gets worse. We’re also facing the climate emergency. Immediate relief is necessary – but not sufficient. To tackle all these crises at once, we need a Green Stimulus that creates jobs and lifts up communities in ways that also slash carbon pollution, increase resiliency, and develop a just, modern economy. No one can predict when Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump will turn their full attention to economic recovery. But behind the scenes, the planning has already begun. It’s not a question of whether we spend big on stimulus, but what kind of stimulus. And while Republicans will decry anything “green”, we can win the argument. But much of what we propose already has bipartisan support, from polling to pending legislation. Climate change is about to supercharge the coronavirus emergency. In April, California’s wildfire season will start. Restrictions on work caused by the pandemic will make it harder for firefighters to conduct controlled burns that steer fires – and smoke – from homes. Californians’ lungs could face Covid-19 and unusually intense smoke at the same time. A third of the country also faces serious flood risk through the spring. And in summer and fall, forecasters predict “above average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States”. We’re already seeing this catastrophic convergence elsewhere: In Ecuador, a muted government response to flooding in indigenous communities, for fear of spreading the virus; in Fiji, devastated by Cyclone Harold this week, 19 confirmed coronavirus cases are casting doubt on how to rebuild. Here too, we will need to find ways to do the needed relief work without deepening the pandemic. Amid all this suffering, the case for bold moves to tackle the miseries of inequality, Covid, and climate at once will get clearer. Moreover, green stimulus is the only option for a smooth transition to the 21st century green economy. The era of dirty energy is ending. Even the conservative CBNC analyst Jim Cramer has warned investors that oil stocks are no longer safe investments, as society is increasingly repudiating fossil fuels. Giant investors like Blackrock are gradually winding down their investments in carbon. And at the European level, and in countries like Germany and South Korea, a green stimulus-based recovery is becoming the consensus choice, with investments in efficiency and clean energy seen as obvious drivers of economic reconstruction. Here in the US, green stimulus is easily the best way to create good jobs through public investment. According to a 2011 World Bank study, $1m invested in the oil and gas in the United States creates just five jobs, compared to 17 jobs per million dollars invested in energy-saving building retrofits, 22 jobs for mass transit, 13 for wind, and 14 for solar. Kammen’s research and that of other institutes all concur that investment in a modern green economy is a more efficient job creator than the fossil sector. The longer-term vision of the green stimulus is a more rewarding, lifelong career of dignified green work. We should also invest in Stem education for all children and create apprenticeship programs in vulnerable communities, matched with new careers for workers to enter. And by directly investing in frontline communities, following best practices in California, we can bring technologies like solar and battery storage to neighborhoods that have been scandalously left out of the clean energy boom so far. Plus, these same nimble, local solutions make neighborhoods more resilient to extreme weather. Local storage and nested microgrids make the power system, including healthcare facilities, more reliable during disasters. We’d be making environmental, economic, and social improvements in the same places, at the same time. And we should speak of green investments in concrete terms. Polling conducted by Data for Progress in March finds majority support for massive green spending overall. More interesting is the finding of even greater support – including majority Republican approval – for specific public green investments, like electric buses, retrofits to low-income housing, and renewable energy. Strip away abstract rhetoric, and the substance that we’re advocating is incredibly popular. For these reasons, we recently joined nine other experts in social and climate policy to write a letter to Congress outlining a menu of policy options for a Green Stimulus. Our proposals span eight sectors of the economy. But fundamentally, a Green Stimulus is about mobilizing massive public funds – say, $2tn to start – in specific green investments to create high-quality jobs and improve the quality of life, especially in low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, which have suffered the most disinvestment and pollution in recent decades. It seems counterintuitive, but the timing for such a Green Stimulus is perfect. Bridge-loans and advance payments on public green purchases of goods like solar panels and electric vehicles for public use would stabilize firms’ and workers’ finances. Announcing initiatives like a Climate Conservation Corps would give young people eager to work jobs to apply for, and plan to start. And desk workers across the economy could get on Zoom and do paperwork to make green projects shovel-ready the minute it’s safe to break ground. (Indeed, a major reason the 2009 Obama stimulus faltered was months wasted on paperwork.) Each of us has lived through climate-fueled disasters – in Cohen’s case, Hurricane Sandy, and in Kammen’s, last year’s devastating wildfires. We agree with the environmental justice advocates who argued then that disaster recovery shouldn’t be about trying to bounce back to how things were before the disaster. We don’t want to bounce back to a January 2020 economy when half the country lived paycheck to paycheck; unchecked carbon pollution endangered our future; and racial inequalities made people of color so vulnerable to disease. Rather, by deploying a Green Stimulus that centers workers and communities, we can bounce forward together. Daniel Aldana Cohen is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2, and is a co-author of A Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal Daniel Kammen is professor at the University of California, Berkeley, coordinating lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and former Science Envoy for the United States Department of State This story is a part of Covering Climate Now’s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

"**Quizzes rather than board games are one of the recommendations from scientists for a Covid-safe Christmas.**
Earlier this week, the government announced up to three households will be allowed to form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December.
But the government's scientific advisory committee, Sage, warns coronavirus could easily spread during the festive relaxation of the rules.
They say people should still weigh up if an event could be postponed.
If not, meeting online or outdoors where the risks of transmission are lower, could be a better option.
But if you do go ahead, they say, it's important to include everyone taking part in drawing up a plan for how to manage the event.
They highlight the particular importance of involving women in the decision-making.
The document says: ""Women carry the burden of creating and maintaining family traditions and activities at Christmas.
""Messaging should be supportive of women adapting traditions and encouraging those around them to share the burden and to be supportive of any alterations to adapt for Covid-19 restrictions.""
The advisers recognise that negotiating these arrangements may ""create tensions"".
But they suggest a series of measures, ranging from minimising the numbers getting together to keeping events brief to avoiding physical contact.
Maintaining social distancing, keeping surfaces clean and opening windows to allow in fresh air are all highlighted.
There are also practical suggestions:
But there's a warning that no single measure will guarantee that Christmas is risk-free.
Scientists warn that, within households, one infected person can pass the virus to as many as 50% of the rest.
And they say that the spread of the disease could multiply as the newly-infected people return to their usual lives after the break.
In one paper, the advisers spell out that ""this is not a theoretical risk"".
They point to earlier research into how other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia increase as older family members are exposed during the school holidays.
That's why they conclude that cases are set to rise.
""The prevalence could easily double during a few days of the festive season, with further multiplicative increases as new infections go back to their ""routine"" networks.""
Another document published by Sage makes clear that most coronavirus infections happen during prolonged indoor gatherings of people who are familiar with each other.
That creates what's called an ""intimacy paradox"" in which we let our guard down because we don't see our loved ones as a potential dangers."

INTRODUCTION
I’ve written numerous posts that describe the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), what the PDO represents, and, just as important, what it does not represent. For those new to the PDO and for those needing a refresher, refer to An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3.
IceCap recently published a post about the PDO. One of the illustrations in that post confirms a point I have been making: that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperatures of the North Pacific. And I’ve added a few additional comments and clarifications about the IceCap post.
In my post An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3, the discussions of the PDO patternwere about the spatial pattern. But the word pattern can also be time-related and, therefore, it could pertain to the PDO’s “behavior in time”. A recent discussion on a blog thread gave me the impression that the multiple meanings of the word pattern could be the cause of some of the confusion about the PDO.
Also, much of the post An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3discussed and illustrated the fact that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies of the North Pacific. There is another factor that may lead to some of the continued misunderstandings about the PDO. The PDO data is standardized. This could greatly exaggerate the magnitude of its variations. Could the standardization also inflate its perceived importance?
I had also wanted to include the errors in the SkepticalScience post It’s Pacific Decadal Oscillation . The SkepticalScience post was obviously written by someone who never plotted the Sea Surface Temperature anomalies of the North Pacific, who misunderstands how the PDO is calculated and what it represents, and who misunderstands or elects to misrepresent climate oscillations. But this post is long, so I’ll present the Skeptical Science errors in a separate post.
THE ICECAP PDO POST
Figure 1 is a screen cap of the opening of Joe D’Aleo’s post about the PDO at IceCap. I’ve included the screen cap because if you were to click on the post title Is the PDO real or a skeptic inventionat IceCap the link does not bring you to the post; it links to a .pdf document titled “THE PDO.” Most of the IceCap post and the linked .pdf document appear to be the same, but their opening paragraphs and the titles are different.

Figure 1

That aside, most of the IceCap post is intended to confirm the existence of the PDO, which is something I don’t dispute. If you’ve watched any of the SST .gif animations or videos I’ve prepared, the positive and negative PDO spatial patterns are very visible. And they should be; the PDO spatial pattern is the most prevalent of the many that form in the North Pacific SST anomalies. The IceCap post also mentions using the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in weather forecasts. Since there are a number of papers that describe weather patterns associated with the PDO, I imagine the PDO data is a useful index for meteorologists.
But one of the points that I have illustrated and discussed a number of times is that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature anomalies of the North Pacific, north of 20N. The IceCap post includes a group of PDO- and ENSO-related maps, Figure 2. And those maps actually illustrate that the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies of the North Pacific.

Figure 2
I’ve modified the illustration, Figure 3, by highlighting the area used to calculate the PDO data and by covering the rest of the maps with text. The PDO is not calculated from the SST data south of 20N, so all of that additional visual information exaggerates the surface area represented by the PDO.

Figure 3
My text in Figure 3 reads: In The Positive (Warm) Phase Map Of The PDO Shown Above Left, The Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly For The North Pacific North Of 20N Appears To Be Negative. That Is, The Negative SST Anomalies Cover A Greater Surface Area And They Are More Intense Than The Positive Anomalies. The Opposite Holds True For The Map On The Right-Hand Side. How Then Could A Positive (Warm) Phase Of The PDO Raise Global Surface Temperatures, And Vice Versa?
Someone is bound to note that the IceCap post does not mention that the PDO has an impact on Global surface temperatures. Agreed. Their post doesn’t. This part of my discussion is about the common belief that the sign of the PDO dictates whether global temperatures rise or fall. Since the sign of the PDO does not represent the Sea Surface Temperature of the North Pacific the belief is unfounded.
In past posts, I’ve presented that there is an inverse relationship between the PDO and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Anomalies of the North Pacific. This can be shown with a graph that compares the PDO data and the difference between the SST anomalies of the North Pacific north of 20N and global SST anomalies. For simplicity sake, we’ll use the term “North Pacific Residual” for the data that’s calculated as the North Pacific SST anomalies minus the Global SST anomalies. Refer to Figure 4. We’ll use the North Pacific Residual in the comparison graph because one of the steps taken to calculate the PDO is to subtract Global SST anomalies from the SST anomalies of each 5 degree by 5 degree grid of the North Pacific north of 20N. Both datasets in Figure 4 have been smoothed with 121-month running average filters. Other than the agreement between the multidecadal variations in the two curves, there are a couple of things to note about the graph. First, the PDO data has been inverted; that is, it’s been multiplied by a negative number. Second, the PDO data has also been scaled by a factor of 0.2. That was an arbitrarily chosen round number I used to bring the variations of the PDO down into line with the North Pacific Residual data. But let’s look at the scaling in another way: the multidecadal variations in the PDO data are five times higher than the actual variations in the North Pacific Residual data in that graph. One might conclude the PDO data exaggerates the actual multidecadal variations in North Pacific SST anomalies. More on that later.

Figure 4
Figure 4 is taken from the post An Inverse Relationship Between The PDO And North Pacific SST Anomaly Residuals.
The SST anomaly data for the North Pacific is part of the Global Surface Temperature data, but the PDO data is not. This inverse relationship between the PDO and the SST anomaly data of the North Pacific directly contradicts the assumption that a positive (warm) PDO is responsible a rise in global temperatures or that a negative (cold) PDO is somehow responsible for a drop in global temperatures.
The IceCap post attempts to resurrect the argument that there is no clear evidence that ENSO drives the PDO. IceCap bases their brief discussion on a quote from the 14-year old Mantua et al (1997) paper “A Pacific interdecadal climate oscillation with impacts on salmon production.” The IceCap post reads, “The authors made no claim as to which (PDO or ENSO) was the chicken and which the egg.” And IceCap includes a quote from Mantua et al (1997):
“The ENSO and PDO climate patterns are clearly related, both spatially and temporally, to the extent that the PDO may be viewed as ENSO-like interdecadal climate variability (Tanimoto et al. 1993; ZWB). While it may be tempting to interpret interdecadal climatic shifts as responses to individual (tropical) ENSO events, it seems equally conceivable that the state of the interdecadal PDO constrains the envelope of interannual ENSO variability.”
That paragraph from Mantua et al (1997) appears to contradict a paper they reference. Mantua et al (1997) calculate the PDO using a method that was presented in Zhang et al (1997) ENSO-like Interdecadal Variability: 1900–93. In Zhang et al (1997), the PDO was identified as “NP”, and they use Cold Tongue Index SST anomalies (CT) as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) proxy. Zhang et al (1997) note:
“Figure 7 shows the cross-correlation function between CT and each of the other time series in Fig. 5. The lag is barely perceptible for TP and G and it increases to about a season for G – TP and NP, confirming that on the interannual timescale the remote features in the patterns shown in Fig. 6 are occurring in response to the ENSO cycle rather than as an integral part of it…”
It would be difficult for the PDO to drive ENSO if ENSO leads the PDO by a season and if the PDO spatial pattern is a “response to the ENSO cycle rather than…an integral part of it.”
In the 14 years since Mantua et al (1997) was published, there have been a number of papers that confirm that ENSO drives the PDO. In ENSO-Forced Variability of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Newman et al (2004) also found that the PDO lags ENSO. They describe cell d of their Figure 1 as:
“ENSO also leads the PDO index by a few months throughout the year (Fig. 1d), most notably in winter and summer. Simultaneous correlation is lowest in November– March, consistent with Mantua et al. (1997). The lag of maximum correlation ranges from two months in summer (r ~ 0.7) to as much as five months by late winter (r ~ 0.6). During winter and spring, ENSO leads the PDO for well over a year, consistent with reemergence of prior ENSO-forced PDO anomalies. Summer PDO appears to lead ENSO the following winter, but this could be an artifact of the strong persistence of ENSO from summer to winter (r = 0.8), combined with ENSO forcing of the PDO in both summer and winter. Note also that for intervals less than 1yr the lag autocorrelation of the PDO is low when the lag autocorrelation of ENSO (not shown) is also low, through the so-called spring persistence barrier (Torrence and Webster 1998).”
And the first sentence of the Conclusions of Newman et al (2004) reads (their italics):
“The PDO is dependent upon ENSO on all timescales.”
My post An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3 included the same discussions of those two papers under the heading of DOES THE PDO DRIVE ENSO? 
A more recent paper, Shakun and Shaman (2009) “Tropical origins of North and South Pacific decadal variability” also confirms that the PDO is an aftereffect of ENSO. In addition to the PDO, they use the acronym PDV for Pacific Decadal Variability.
The Shakun and Shaman (2009) Conclusions read:
“Deriving a Southern Hemisphere equivalent of the PDO index shows that the spatial signature of the PDO can be well explained by the leading mode of SST variability for the South Pacific. Thus, PDV appears to be a basin-wide phenomenon most likely driven from the tropics. Moreover, while it was already known PDV north of the equator could be adequately modeled as a reddened response to ENSO, our results indicate this is true to an even greater extent in the South Pacific.”
These papers confirm my statements from past posts that the PDO is an aftereffect of ENSO. And that brings us to the two tables from the IceCap post, which I have merged into one graphic, Figure 5. IceCap introduces the tables by stating:
“During the positive phase see the dominance of more frequent, stronger, longer La Ninas and the positive PDO mode, more frequent, stronger and longer El Ninos.”
There is an obvious error in that sentence. It should begin with “During the negativephase…”

Figure 5
Now I do realize that IceCap has not stated that the positive PDO is responsible for the more frequent, stronger and longer El Niño events and vice versa, but they implied it. And that contradicts the papers above. Since the PDO is an aftereffect of ENSO, a period when El Niño events dominated would cause the PDO to be positive, and vice versa for epochs when La Niña events dominate.
A SIMPLE DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE PDO SPATIAL PATTERN IS FORMED
To reinforce the discussion above, the following is a simple explanation of the processes that cause the PDO spatial pattern during ENSO events.
A positive PDO spatial pattern is characterized by SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific that are higher than the SST anomalies in the central and western North Pacific. That positive PDO pattern is created by the response of the North Pacific SST anomalies to an El Niño event. Changes in coupled ocean-atmosphere processes, resulting from the El Niño, can cause an increase in the SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific. Since the El Niño causes a reversal of trade winds in the western tropical Pacific, less warm water than normal is spun up into the western and central North Pacific (an area called the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension or KOE), and SST anomalies of the western and central North Pacific drop. The initial drop in the western and central North Pacific is also driven by the changes in coupled ocean-atmosphere processes that are caused by the El Niño. The reverse holds true during a La Niña in the eastern North Pacific. For the western and central North Pacific during a La Niña, the leftover warm water from the El Niño also gets spun up into the KOE, adding to the warm waters being brought there by the increased strength of the trade winds, both of which raise SST anomalies there.
There are differences between the PDO and an ENSO proxy such as NINO3.4 SST anomalies from time to time. (NINO3.4 SST anomalies are a commonly used proxy for the frequency and magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events.) The reason for this is that other factors can impact how the North Pacific SST anomalies respond to ENSO events. These other factors include shifts in sea level pressure in the North Pacific and a phenomenon called The Reemergence Mechanismalong the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension (KOE). Aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions should also account for some of the differences between the PDO and an ENSO proxy, though I have never seen this discussed in any papers.
CAN THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF THE WORD PATTERN ADD TO THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE PDO?
The Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and OceanJoint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO) Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) webpage is a primary source for PDO information and data. Two maps are used by JISAO to illustrate the spatial patterns that can exist during the warm and cool phases of the PDO, Figure 6. I’ve highlighted the area of the North Pacific represented by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. It is the area north of 20N, and only that area. The word “pattern” in the opening paragraph on that webpage refers to the “spatial climate fingerprint” of the North Pacific north of 20N, not the multidecadal variability of its data. As discussed previously in this post, when the PDO data is positive (warm phase), the SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific are warmer than those in the western and central North Pacific, and when the PDO is negative (cool phase), the SST anomalies in the eastern North Pacific are cooler than the SST anomalies in the western and central north Pacific.

Figure 6
Farther down on the JISAO PDO webpage, the PDO is described as:
The “Pacific Decadal Oscillation” (PDO) is a long-lived El Niño-like pattern of Pacific climate variability. While the two climate oscillations have similar spatial climate fingerprints, they have very different behavior in time.
Again, the word pattern is being used to describe spatial characteristics of the SST anomalies.
As discussed in An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3An Introduction To ENSO, AMO, and PDO — Part 3, the phrase “El Niño-like pattern” does NOT mean that the North Pacific (north of 20N) has a separate El Niño-like event.It refers to the fact that a typical El Niño event creates a spatial pattern in the North Pacific where it is warmer in the east than it is in the central and western portions, and a typical La Niña event will create the opposite pattern, cooler in the east than it is toward the center and west of the North Pacific.
Figure 7 is a time-series graph that compares the PDO and NINO3.4 SST anomalies (a commonly used proxy for the frequency and magnitude of El Niño and La Niña events). Both datasets have been smoothed with a 121-month filter. Keep in mind that the NINO3.4 SST anomalies represent exactly that, the SST anomalies of an area of the tropical Pacific called the NINO3.4 region, which is bordered by the coordinates of 5S-5N, 170W-120W, while the PDO does not represent the SST anomalies of the North Pacific. The PDO is a statistically manufactured dataset. As illustrated, the multidecadal variations in the PDO and the NINO3.4 SST anomalies are different. Both vary from positive to negative in the mid-1940s and rise from negative to positive in the late 1970s, but the NINO3.4 SST anomalies have an extra period of positive values in the 1960s. As discussed earlier in this post, the reason the PDO has a different “behavior in time” is because the PDO is also strongly impacted by other factors, including sea level pressure and volcanic eruptions.

Figure 7
In summary, on the main JISAO Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) webpage, the word pattern always refers to the “spatial” characteristics of the North Pacific SST anomalies, not its behavior in time.
THE WORD PATTERN CAN ALSO BE TIME RELATED
The second illustration on the main JISAO Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) webpage is a time-series graph of the PDO data. It was missing from the website as I prepared this post. But there are copies posted at other websites. Refer to Figure 8.

Figure 8
On their PDO Index Monthly Values webpage, JISAO uses the phrase “the pattern of variability” to describe the PDO’s “behavior in time” or the periodicity of the PDO data. Refer to the description of the dataset at the top of the page. It reads (my boldface):
Updated standardized values for the PDO index, derived as the leading PC of monthly SST anomalies in the North Pacific Ocean, poleward of 20N. The monthly mean global average SST anomalies are removed to separate this pattern of variability from any “global warming” signal that may be present in the data. 
The uses of the word pattern are different, and their intents are different. Does the use of the word pattern in both instances add to the confusion about the PDO? I don’t have the answer. I’m asking the question. Clearly, the use of pattern in the JISAO description of “The ‘Pacific Decadal Oscillation’ (PDO) is a long-lived El Niño-like pattern” relates to its spatial characteristics. Likewise, the word pattern in the JISAO description of their maps, “Typical wintertime Sea Surface Temperature (colors), Sea Level Pressure (contours) and surface windstress (arrows) anomaly patternsduring warm and cool phases of PDO,” refers to the same thing, the spatial pattern.
Note: I mentioned above that there are no El Niño or La Niña events in the North Pacific north of 20N. I have shown, however, that there are secondary releases of heat in the North Pacific from the warm waters left over from an El Niño. These secondary releases of heat from the North Pacific occur along the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) and they occur during La Niña events that follow major El Niño events. Refer to The ENSO-Related Variations In Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) SST Anomalies And Their Impact On Northern Hemisphere Temperatures.
DOES THE PDO DATA EXAGGERATE ITS RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE?
Figure 9 compares the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data and NINO3.4 SST anomalies. The scales are similar and that might lead one who is unaware of the differences between the two datasets to believe the two “signals” are similar in magnitude. That’s wrong for a number of reasons. First, the NINO3.4 SST anomalies represent the SST anomalies of an area in the equatorial Pacific, but the PDO data does not represent the SST anomalies of the North Pacific. The PDO data is a statistically manufactured dataset that represents an abstract form of the SST data there. Second, the NINO3.4 SST anomalies are presented in Deg C. The PDO data is not. The PDO data has been standardized.

Figure 9
Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no PDO data available online that has not been standardized. So to illustrate the PDO data before standardization, one would have to duplicate the process JISAO uses to create it. Two of the three SST datasets JISAO uses are obsolete and the differences between those older datasets and the current spatially complete datasets are significant, so the results could be very different. And we really do not need to go through all of that trouble to show that the PDO exaggerates the variability of the North Pacific SST anomalies. We can show that other ways.
The inverse relationship between the PDO and the North Pacific Residual was illustrated in Figure 4. And as you’ll recall, the North Pacific Residual was calculated by subtracting Global SST anomalies from North Pacific SST anomalies, north of 20N. Both datasets in Figure 4 were smoothed with a 121-month running-average filter and the PDO data was scaled and inverted (multiplied by -0.2) to bring its variations into line with the North Pacific Residual data. For the next illustration, Figure 10, let’s leave the PDO data in its raw monthly form, and only invert (multiply by -1) the North Pacific Residual data. That is, we won’t scale either dataset. As shown in Figure 10, the actual variations in the North Pacific Residual are miniscule compared to those of the standardized PDO data.

Figure 10
The standard deviation of the North Pacific Residual data is 0.177, so to standardize that dataset we divide it by that value, or multiply it by its reciprocal of 5.65. Refer to Figure 11. Note how well the inverted and standardized North Pacific Residual data (using a different SST dataset, HADISST) captures the underlying multidecadal variations of the PDO data.

Figure 11
And we can detrend the North Pacific SST anomaly data to also show how the PDO exaggerates actual North Pacific Sea Surface Temperature variability. Again in this example, both datasets are in their “raw” form, and the detrended North Pacific SST anomalies are inverted (multiplied by -1.0). The PDO data as shown in Figure 12 greatly exaggerates the actual variations in the detrended North Pacific SST anomalies.

Figure 12
To standardize the detrended North Pacific SST anomalies, we’ll divide the data by its standard deviation (0.182), or multiply it by its reciprocal of 5.5. Once again, as shown in Figure 13, much of the multidecadal variability of the PDO can be captured by inverting and scaling the adjusted North Pacific SST anomalies.

Figure 13
Whether we present the North Pacific SST anomalies detrended or as a residual, the PDO data exaggerates the actual variations in North Pacific SST anomalies by a factor of at least 5.5. This may also lead to some the misunderstandings of the effects of the PDO on global temperatures.
CLOSING
The PDO is a useful index. Based on the IceCap post, it is used by meteorologists for weather predictions. The early papers about the PDO discussed its impact on salmon production, so it is also useful in those endeavors. But the PDO cannot be used to explain epochs of global warming or cooling because the PDO does not represent a process through which the North Pacific could raise or lower global temperatures.
This post also illustrated how the PDO data is inversely related to North Pacific SST anomalies and how the PDO data greatly exaggerates the actual variations in the Sea Surface Temperatures of the North Pacific.
In a follow-up post, we’ll discuss the error-filled SkepticalScience post It’s Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA newly published paper by Nicola Scafetta of Duke University takes a look at sea level rise, particularly acceleration and deceleration in relation to ocean cycles: Multi-scale dynamical analysis (MSDA) of sea level records versus PDO, AMO, and NAO indexes. Climate Dynamics, in press.
Photo right: Prof. Nicola Scafetta
Professor Scafetta examined tide gauge records scattered over the globe that go back 300 years and compared the data to ocean cycles PDO, AMO and NAO indexes. He found some interesting results, to put it mildly.
According to the abstract of Scafetta’s paper:
Tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly from positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO oscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60–70 year natural oscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records.”
Moreover in the paper’s conclusion Scafetta writes that the tide gauge records were found…(my emphasis)
…to be characterized by significant oscillations at the decadal and multidcadal scales up to about 110-year intervals. Within these scales both positive and negative accelerations are found if a record is sufficiently long. This result suggests that acceleration patterns in tide gauge records are mostly driven by the natural oscillations of the climate system.”

No mention here of anything man-made. His conclusion also states (my emphasis):

In fact, although during the last 40–60 years positive accelerations are typically observed in tide gauge records, as found by Sallenger et al. (2012) and by Boon (2012), also during 40–60 year intervals since the beginning of the twentieth century equivalent or even higher positive accelerations are typically observed. On the contrary, at these same time scales, negative accelerations are observed during the middle of the twentieth century. This pattern demonstrates the influence of a large multidecadal 60-year natural cycle, which has been found in climate and solar/ astronomical records by numerous authors (e.g: Klyashtorin et al. 2009; Jevrejeva et al. 2008; Chambers et al. 2012; Scafetta 2010, 2012a; Scafetta and Willson 2013; Ogurtsov et al. 2002; Soon and Legates 2013).”

The argument that man’s fingerprint can be found in global sea level rise over the last century is looking weaker than ever (ignoring contribution by groundwater extraction on land). Sea level rise began its steady hike in 1850 when the world began to thaw naturally in the wake of the Little Ice Age. Periods of acceleration and deceleration coincide with oceanic cycles and have nothing to do with CO2 concentrations, let alone man.
The following chart is Figure 2 of the paper and is for illustrating the relation between the AMO and New York’s tide gauge record:

The federal government imposes a mandate to blend corn ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s gasoline. This “renewable fuel standard” or RFS produces a range of negative effects, as discussed in this study at DownsizingGovernment.  




The “10% Ethanol” sticker you see at the gas station indicates that the government is subverting your free choice and raising your driving costs to benefit corn farmers. The government has decided that corn farmers are more important than you are.   
  
  
President Trump has supported the ethanol mandate, and he recently acted to increase the harm by allowing greater use of a 15 percent ethanol blend.   
  
  
A _Washington Post_ editorial today describes why that move is misguided:   




For more than a decade, the United States has pursued the foolhardy energy policy known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. Thanks to legislation passed by a Democratic Congress and signed into law by a Republican president, George W. Bush, in 2007, the RFS illustrates the sad‐​but‐​true principle of Washington life that bipartisanship is no guarantee of wisdom. In a nutshell, the RFS required the nation’s petroleum refiners to blend ever‐​increasing quantities of biofuels, chiefly ethanol, into gasoline, purportedly to promote energy independence and fight climate change.   
  
  
Never mind that the United States has meanwhile become a major oil exporter, due to a production boom. Never mind that the environmental harms of ethanol arguably outweigh its benefits, because it takes massive amounts of energy to distill ethanol from corn — and massive amounts of fragile farmland to grow that crop. Never mind that diverting resources into corn production for ethanol raises the price of food. Never mind all that, because 39 percent of Iowa’s corn crop goes to create nearly 30 percent of all U.S. ethanol. And Iowa is a swing state with six crucial electoral votes and a first‐​in‐​the‐​nation presidential caucus; whatever Iowa wants, Iowa gets, from politicians of both parties.   
  
  
Hence President Trump’s announcement, on the midterm‐​election campaign trail in Iowa, that he would, in effect, double down on this decreasingly justifiable policy. Mr. Trump declared that the Environmental Protection Agency will draft regulations allowing the year‐​round sale of motor fuel containing 15 percent ethanol, as opposed to the 10 percent limitation in effect for several months a year because of air‐​pollution concerns related to summertime atmospheric conditions. This would incentivize gas station owners to install pumps capable of delivering the fuel, thus boosting ethanol sales.   
  
  
The point is to rescue Iowa corn farmers from adverse market conditions, which include lower prices because of retaliation from trading partners against Mr. Trump’s tariffs. The more fundamental problem is that, at its inception, the RFS assumed that ever‐​rising U.S. gas consumption would permit refiners to absorb huge amounts of ethanol. In fact, the year after Congress adopted the bipartisan RFS legislation, the U.S. economy went into a recession, causing a collapse in the number of miles Americans drove and the amount of fuel consumed per capita. Only last year did consumption return to pre‐​recession levels.   
  
  
Refiners face high and rising costs when they are forced either to mix more ethanol into their motor fuels or to buy offsetting credits known, obscurely, as Renewable identification numbers (RIN). Plagued by volatility and manipulation, the market for RIN has turned into a major headache for smaller refiners, which often seek waivers of the ethanol blending requirement. The entire system adds enormous bureaucracy and complexity to the fuel market, with little or no benefit to consumers. E15, as the 15 percent ethanol blend is known, might cost less per gallon, but because of its lower energy content, motorists would probably get poorer mileage and have to fill up more often.   
  
  
The petroleum industry has promised a lawsuit to stop Mr. Trump’s plan. While we hesitate to take sides between agribusiness and Big Oil, in this instance public policy clearly favors the latter.

The federal‐​spending avalanche just pushed the government’s debt over $12 trillion, and Congress will soon have to vote on raising the legal debt limit. Spending has soared so high that 40 percent of this year’s budget will be funded by borrowing. The massive flow of red ink is prompting centrist legislators to rally around an ingenious plan to steer a big new tax hike through Congress.



The plan is for a bipartisan task force to design a large deficit‐​reduction package that would be fast‐​tracked through the legislative process to ensure a swift up‐​or‐​down vote in the House and Senate. In the House, more than 80 members have signed onto the idea, and in the Senate some members want to tie the creation of a task force to the upcoming debt‐​limit vote. Senators Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) are leading the charge, and they are backed by former heads of the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office.



In recent hearings, Senate Budget Committee chairman Conrad said that “everything would be on the table” for his proposed task force, including “tax reform” to meet the “revenue challenge we face from an outdated and inefficient revenue system” that is “hemorrhaging revenue.” Such a task force suffers from three fatal flaws.





The real solution is to change the incentive structure in Congress to encourage frugal behavior on a sustained basis.



The first is that the resulting tax increase would be on top of all the other tax increases on the table, including the scheduled rise in income‐​tax rates in 2011 and possible increases to fund health‐​care and climate‐​change legislation.



The second is that CBO’s long‐​term projections reveal a spending catastrophe, not a “revenue challenge.” As the economy recovers, revenues will rise to their historical norm of about 18 percent of gross domestic product and then keep on growing, even without any legislated increases. On the other hand, spending is expected to skyrocket from 21 percent of the economy in 2008 to at least 40 percent by 2050, or more if a new federal health plan is enacted. If Congress tried to raise taxes to match this soaring spending, the economy would enter a death spiral of declining growth and a shrinking tax base. Tax increases would be economic suicide in a global economy where American workers and businesses are already struggling to compete. Indeed, we should cut tax rates, particularly on capital, to generate the higher labor productivity and greater entrepreneurship we need to support the huge costs of baby‐​boomer retirement.



The third fatal flaw of a fiscal task force is that the government’s spending addiction cannot be cured in a one‐​shot treatment. If task‐​force proposals to cut spending were actually enacted, members of Congress would immediately go to work to reverse them. If a task force cut farm subsidies, for example, farm‐​subsidy supporters such as Senator Conrad would simply add them back in the next farm bill.



The real solution is to change the incentive structure in Congress to encourage frugal behavior on a sustained basis. One idea is to shake up congressional committees, which are the hubs of special‐​interest‐​spending pressures on Capitol Hill. Today, members get on certain committees — and stay on them for decades — because such positions give them the ability to direct federal dollars toward programs that benefit their states (or programs that they’re emotionally attached to).



Consider that the head of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Blanche Lincoln (D., Ark.), is from a heavily subsidized farming state and that she proudly boasts of her family’s farming heritage. Obviously, Lincoln and other members in similar situations aren’t going to balance federal taxpayers’ interests with those of program recipients in a neutral and dispassionate manner.



The solution to this conflict of interest is to have random assignment to all committees in the House and Senate and to impose term limits on committee membership. That would disrupt entrenched lobbying relationships on Capitol Hill, and it would populate committees with at least some members who could take an independent and critical eye to committee business.



Another way to change congressional incentives and encourage spending restraint is to enact a legal cap on the growth in the overall budget. Under a cap, Congress could not increase total annual outlays by more than the growth in some economic variable such as personal income, perhaps averaged over five years. If it did, the administration would be required at the end of the year to determine the amount of the excess and cut programs across the board to meet the cap.



It’s true that Congress could rewrite or suspend such a statutory cap if it didn’t want to comply with it down the road. But a cap would be a high‐​profile symbol of budget restraint for taxpayers to rally around and defend. It would be easy for concerned citizens to understand a law that said that the government’s budget shouldn’t grow faster than the average family’s budget.



Supporters of a task force argue correctly that we need new budgetary procedures to control exploding deficits. But rather than a one‐​time deal to raise taxes and provide probably temporary spending cuts, we need permanent changes to congressional rules and incentives. We should start by shaking up the pro‐​spending structure of committees and then cap the budget to force the trade‐​offs needed to avert the coming debt disaster.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately climate scientists have been telling us that cold weather is now evidence of warming, hard winters and big snowstorms, too.
Well, it turns out that the current global temperature stagnation is also now strong evidence of global warming. At least that’s what climate modeller Prof. Reto Knutti writes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich blogsite in a piece titled: “Climate is (not) taking a break”, where he twists himself into a complex pretzel to explain why there’s been a global temperature stagnation. Hey, our models actually predicted it!

Prof. Knutti leads the Climate Physics group at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich. It focuses on climate modeling. See his publications here. Photo credit: Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich; Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science.
In his blog article he starts by claiming that the stagnant temperature of the last 15 years: “…is nothing unusual: Also during the 20th century there were periods of stagnation, and even cooling. Even climate models show such behaviour – also for the future. So they do not contradict the long-term global temperatures.”
It wasn’t long ago that climate scientists were claiming things were “worse then we thought” and that the climate was careening out of control. Now that the climate is not changing at all, they are suddenly saying they aren’t surprised at all, and are even starting to claim their models had projected it.
Knutti even takes it a step further. In his piece he even tries to have us believe that the stagnation is actually evidence of warming! You see, from dozens of models, he managed to find one or two that foresee periods of stagnation interrupting the overall warming. He writes:

Not surprised…
Since the beginning of the 1970s, the global temperature has risen strongly. However in the last 10-15 years the trend has flattened out considerably. Depending on the year used as a starting point, the trend is practically zero. This is what temperature curves from the different institutes show. Even when there are some slight variations between the curves, they all show the same pattern [1].
The fact that the global temperature rise has stagnated does not contradict long-term climate change. To the contrary: Also in the future we have to anticipate short periods of stagnation or cooling. In principle, the science is not surprised by this finding. This is because such short-term temperature behavior also occurs in climate models (see chart). And that, by the way, in the same models that postulate an anthropogenic temperature increase over the long term.”
I placed the emphasis on “To the contrary” because it tells us that Knutti is claiming that because there is a stagnation today, and the models said there would be, the longterm-warming trend for the next 100 years has to be right. Such is the science of a climate modeller.
Here’s the chart he refers to, along with the text below it:

“Global temperature change in simulations from climate models from CMIP5 for the historical period (gray) and for various scenarios. Each line depicts a simulation. The observed data are depicted in black. As an example, one simulation, marked yellow, shows especially strong warming until the year 2000 and then followed by a period without warming over 20 years.”
Because the yellow model has it right, it has to mean that the modelled warming is correct – Knutti is suggesting. This is as preposterous as science could ever get. From dozens of models, he cherry-picks the one or two that support what he wants to believe.
One scientist has pointed out to me that there’s even a model that doesn’t show any warming until 2050. He wrote in an e-mail: “There is even one model curve which has hardly any warming until 2050. That must be their fall-back rescue anchor. If temperatures in 2050 are like today’s, then they will still claim they were right.”
So what’s the cause of the current stagnation?
Knutti proposes a variety of explanations: “Aerosols or also land-use. Then there are natural factors, like volcanos erupting or solar activity and internal fluctuations (weather). They all vary – and with it the annual temperature increase.”
Knutti also adds that the sun and El Nino phenomenon perhaps play a role in the stagnation. About temperature stagnations he even says: “They are to some extent a type of extreme event of the future.” And thus are evidence of climate change?
Of course, we don’t think for a minute Knutti himself actually believes the rubbish he is spewing above, i.e. stagnation supports the CO2 warming theory. At the end of his essay he even makes a confession, and opens the door to the possibility CO2 may be completely exaggerated:
It could be that the temperature reacts less strongly to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere than assumed (over-estimated climate sensitivity). Or to put it in another way: The climate models may be over-estimating the warming. The global temperature of the last 10-20 years is pointing in that direction, however it is precisely the models with the higher senitivity that are simulating the mean climate the best.”
PS: Here’s a chart of CMIP5, h/t a reader. Where’s the predicted stagnation?

There are really only two reasons to discuss greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide) in the context of dietary guidelines in the U.S., and yet the USDA and HHS did neither in their _Scientific Report_ of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC).



The first reason would be to discuss how the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 — a result primarily of the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy — is a growing benefit to plant life. This is an appropriate discussion in a dietary context as atmospheric CO2 is a fertilizer that promotes healthier, more productive plants, including crops used directly as food for humans or indirectly as animal feed. It has been estimated that from the atmospheric CO2 enrichment to date, total crop production as increased by 10–15 percent. This is a positive and beneficial outcome and one that most certainly should be included in any discussion of the role of greenhouse gases emissions in diet and nutrition — but is inexplicably lacking from such discussion in the DGAC report.



The second reason to discuss greenhouse gas emissions in a diet and nutrition report would be to dispel the notion that through your choice of food you can “do something” about climate change. In this context, it would be appropriate to provide a quantitative example of how the dietary changes recommended by the DGAC would potentially impact projections of the future course



of the climate. Again, the DGAC failed to do this. We help fill this oversight with straightforward calculation of averted global warming that assumes all Americans cut meat out of their diet and become vegetarians — an action that, according to the studies cited by the DGAC, would have the maximum possible impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus mitigating future climate change. Even assuming such an unlikely occurrence, the amount of global warming that would be averted works out to 0.01°C (one hundredth of a degree) by the end of the 21st century. Such an inconsequential outcome has no tangible implications. This should be expressed by the DGAC and mention of making dietary changes in the name of climate change must be summarily deleted.



We recommend that if the DGAC insists on including a discussion of greenhouse gas emissions (and thus climate change) in it 2015 Dietary Guidelines, that the current discussion be supplemented, or preferably replaced, with a more accurate and applicable one — one that indicates that carbon dioxide has widespread and near‐​universal positive benefits on the supply of food we eat, and that attempting to limit future climate change through dietary choice is misguided and unproductive. These changes must be made prior to the issuance of the final guidelines.

"The record rainfall and persistent storms of winter 2013-14 caused serious flooding throughout the southwest of England, with breached defences, loss and damage to agricultural land, homes and businesses. A report by Deloitte as the waters receded in April put the cost at £1 billion pounds. Now a parliamentary select committee of MPs has published its report with recommendations for the way flood defence and drainage is funded and managed – many long overdue. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee argues that funds to maintain flood defences are inadequate, calling for a single fund that would allow flexibility between capital and revenue expenditure in any year for this vital area. The committee also recommend Defra give the impact of flooding of agricultural land higher priority, awarding what some would see as greater and overdue recognition to the social and economic aspects of the rural farmland areas. While extra funding has come from the government to protect and recovery flooded farmland, this is mostly money reallocated from other programmes in fairly opaque ways.  There are also demands for clarification of the responsibilities for maintenance and dredging of channels shared by landowners, the local Internal Drainage Boards, and the Environment Agency. Pilot schemes to give more responsibilities for channel maintenance to local landowners should be extended, with funding provided for channel maintenance by the drainage boards to be retained so that it can be handled locally.  The committee is unequivocal about the need to prevent any further losses to frontline staff. At the time of the floods, the Environment Agency was in the process of shedding many hundreds of staff due to government funding cuts. The floods caused a rapid review of this plan, with frontline flood management posts to be retained – at least for this financial year. The committee’s calls for “reassurances” from Defra are backed up by stating that, regardless of budget constraints “the avoidance of flood events that devastate communities should, as far as is possible, take priority over cost-cutting”. It is clear that the committee has particular sympathies with those rural communities affected by the floods, and sees channel dredging as a way of preventing the most devastating effects of flooding. The committee understands this is not a solution that will be useful everywhere, but they recommend that local land owners and drainage boards are allowed to keep channels clear by dredging.  But as part of its role, the Environment Agency is required to assess the benefits of capital investment and maintenance of flood defences, prioritising that which provides the greatest protection for the least money. As I have noted before, total flood defence is a myth: floods happen and will continue to happen and areas at risk cannot be defended in all cases. And so some spending prioritisation is required.    This raises the issue as to how far society as a whole should be responsible for protecting those who choose to live or base their businesses in flood risk areas. It’s understood that the existence of flood defences tends to promote further development in areas already at risk. This is not only an urban phenomenon – farmers in the Somerset Levels lost livestock and winter crops sown in land flooded because the defences were overtopped, land it was only possible to use because of the defences. But dredging the channels there will perhaps cost more than the value of what was lost, even if for the people concerned the impact is just as devastating. This is one reason why there will always be a preference towards protecting more built-up areas, because the benefits of investment in flood defence will be greater.  Not only can we not repel every flood, it’s even been suggested recently that the national benefit from flood protection, in terms of savings due to damage avoided, might have been overestimated. But there have been benefits.  Only 7,000 properties and businesses were affected by flooding last winter, while 1.3m were protected, compared to the 55,000 properties flooded during the 2007 floods. While the two events are not directly comparable, there were communities on some major rivers such as Bewdley on the River Severn that were flooded in 2007 but protected last winter due to investment in defences, permanent or otherwise.  On the other hand, some communities might have experienced flooding aggravated by flood defences elsewhere. The people in Wraysbury and Dachet on the River Thames, for example, feel flooding there was made worse last winter by the Jubilee River, designed to divert water away from Windsor, Eton and Maidenhead and built at a cost of £84m. This is just one example of why flood risk management in a river basin needs to be integrated, not considered only on a local basis. Otherwise excluding water from some areas upstream will increase the risk of areas downstream. The same applies to dredging. Dredging tidal rivers, including parts of the channels in the Somerset Levels, should be done with particular care. Greater channel capacity will, in that case, also allow the high tides to move further upstream and back up more of the water that is being expelled down the rivers. Where a discharge peak coincides with a extreme high tide, this could increase the risk of overtopping embankments.  Dredging will also have a significant impact on the river ecology. The Environment Agency has a responsibility under the 2003 Water Environment Regulations to improve all rivers towards a healthy ecological status – a requirement that may well conflict with dredging a channel. The select committee’s report says nothing about such conflicting requirements, nor how they should affect investment by society as a whole. It has nothing to say about assessing cost-benefits of such investments. It has nothing to say about integrated management, preferring local management instead. And it says nothing about taking steps to prevent further development on flood plains, focusing only on improving and maintaining defences. It seems there are more lessons to be learned from the winter floods of 2013-2104 than the committee have recognised in this report."
"**The NHS's former cancer director is concerned England could see the first decrease in survival rates for decades because of the Covid pandemic.**
In England, 60% fewer patients with suspected cancer were seen in April compared with the same month in 2019.
Prof Sir Mike Richards told BBC Politics East the drop ""will have an impact on cancer survival rates"".
NHS England said while some people were put off coming forward for checks, the NHS message was ""do not delay"".
Sir Mike, who was national cancer director in the Department of Health between 1999 and 2013, said it was too early to put a figure on what the overall effect on cancer survival would be but he said ""what we do know is that over the last 20, 30, 40 years, cancer survival rates in this country have been going up year on year"".
""There is obviously a concern that may actually go down again in the year 2020. But we won't know that for some time,"" he said.
""We know cancer has been hard hit during the pandemic. As soon as the first wave hit, patients weren't coming forward to their GPs so they weren't getting referred to hospitals.
""Diagnostic services were also hit. Surgery was much more difficult.""
Things have picked up since then, he said, and added: ""Instead of the steady rise that we have seen it is possible we could see some decline.""
Colin Allison, 64, from Swardeston in Norfolk, has a brain tumour touching his upper spine.
In February, he went to his GP with symptoms but because of Covid he could not get a scan until July.
""They phoned me a few days beforehand and said 'we're cancelling all routine MRIs',"" he said.
""But I said 'it's not routine - I've got symptoms coming back of a brain tumour'.""
As Mr Allison waited for a scan, symptoms such as double vision worsened. He said he was now waiting for an operation.
""Yes, Covid-19 can be life threatening,"" he said. ""But how many people are dying from cancer this year?""
The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it had increased its MRI capacity after some diagnostic services were hit by the first wave of the pandemic.
It said it was investing Â£8m to replace its CT and MRI scanners with newer imaging equipment and added: ""We would welcome Mr Allison contacting us so we can look into his concerns.""
Fear of catching Covid-19 made the over-65s in particular reluctant to see their GPs during the initial stages of the outbreak, and cancer was most common in older age groups, Sir Mike said.
But he praised the way the NHS had ""done a great job"" to recover from that first wave, with latest data indicating cancer services were getting back to normal.
""In this country in any case we are behind other countries in our cancer survival rates, so there is a major catching up job to do on that anyway,"" he said.
""A lot of that is about making sure patients can get diagnosed earlier.""
He highlighted the shortage of scanning equipment in a recent report for NHS England. ""The figures are very stark,"" he said.
It showed that in 2017 England was at the bottom of a table of 23 developed countries for CT (Computerized Tomography) scanners per 100,000 population.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review on Wednesday announced extra investment in diagnostic equipment as part of a Â£6.3bn increase in NHS spending for 2021-22.
An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""Cancer survival rates are at a record high in England and the number of people being treated for cancer is now back to usual levels of activity.
""The NHS message to the public has always been clear - do not delay, help us to help you by coming forward for care.""

The civil unrest following last week’s police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, followed by the sniper attack on police officers in Dallas, has sparked a new bout of public concern over the hardships of Black America. Those hardships include significantly higher violent crime victimization, higher joblessness, higher poverty, and lower income than the general U.S. population.   
  
  
Previous moments of such concern have prompted politicians to respond with the standard, tired slate of policies that supposedly would “empower” and “lift” African Americans. All too often, those policies mainly empowered government employees and vendors, while the gap between Black America and the rest of the country remains. By the time the policy failures became obvious, public and political interest had waned, and little else happened until new headlines brought new concern.   
  
  
Perhaps this time will be different, and policymakers will try some different ideas that might actually help. Cato offers many recommendations for reforming education, criminal justice, and the social safety net that would especially help black Americans.   
  
  
To those, add this simple, seemingly counterintuitive recommendation: _repeal the minimum wage_.   
  
  
Though some politicians deny it, the link between the minimum wage and unemployment is well established; denying that empirical research is akin to denying the research on climate change. Among the findings is that the minimum wage’s detrimental effects fall hardest on young black males: the same group that suffers some of the worst hardships of Black America. Perhaps if they had greater opportunities to take starter jobs that would give them both income and the work experience that leads to better‐​paying jobs, they’d have a better chance to escape violence and poverty. (Meanwhile, far too many young African American males are pushed into the black market, where they earn sub‐​minimum wages for dangerous work.) Indeed, the empirical work suggests that there’s a direct causal relationship between the minimum wage and crime.   
  
  
Repealing the minimum wage for the sake of black youth would be a great piece of historical closure. The minimum wage was established, in part, to push blacks and women out of jobs that progressives believed should go to white family men. The economic struggles of African Americans today reflect, in part, how well the progressives’ plan worked.

Jacinda is off to Tokelau this weekend. 



New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will visit Tokelau this weekend. 



It’s the first trip to the territory by a prime minister since Helen Clark in 2004 and comes as part of the government’s Pacific Reset strategy.  
Announcing details of the trip on Monday, Ms Ardern acknowledged 15 years was a long time.  
“Tokelau’s remoteness and perhaps difficulty in accessing it has meant that it’s not had the attention that it deserves. Particularly as it is at significant risk of devastating impacts linked to climate change.” 



Jacinda Ardern said she will visit Tokelau’s three atolls and discuss priorities on climate change, health, education and culture.  
She will be there until 1 August. 



  
It sounds like a bit of overkill for a tiny, remote island in the Pacific. It may be a long time since anyone has visited, but surely that is because there is little reason to visit, right?



Well, no. Not so if you are Jacinda Ardern. The following excerpt is from March 2018.



Jacinda Ardern’s father Ross Ardern will step down as the High Commissioner to Niue when his tenure ends in May, **and has been posted to Tokelau.**  
The position in Niue would be taken over by diplomat and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade agriculture development manager Kirk Yates.



  
Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said the administrator’s role was to ensure appropriate public services were delivered to New Zealand citizens living in Tokelau, and to help manage the relationship between the two countries.  
“Mr Ardern’s experience as a High Commissioner, his extensive understanding of the Pacific, and distinguished career with New Zealand Police make him an ideal candidate for this role and I have no doubt he will make a major contribution to the relationship between New Zealand and Tokelau,” Peters said. 



  
So she is spending 6 days in the Pacific, celebrating her birthday, over the weekend. 



So which angle shall we take on this? We could start with the ‘jobs for the boys’ angle, as Ardern Senior was appointed to the role in May last year. 



Or we could go with the fact that this time she really is using the RNZAF 757 for what is obviously a personal trip, to get some family time and do very little… which is pretty much all she does anyway.



Can you imagine the howls of rage if John Key had done this? Even if this is a genuine diplomatic trip (which I really doubt) it is all about the look of the thing. She ought to know not to time her trip to coincide with her birthday, which is obviously family time.



But you have to have a competent media to drive that particular point home. And, as our media won’t call her out on this, we will.



Happy birthday, Jacinda. I wish you no ill will personally, but I hope there are not ‘many happy returns’ for you as prime minister. I’d like a prime minister that does some work, for a change.



If we had a decent media and a proper opposition, she would not be getting away with this.



After all, she was holidaying in the Cook Islands only last week. Seriously, how many holidays does this woman need?

"**While it may sound ""somewhat implausible"", Welsh house prices have risen recently despite the pandemic, according to the Principality.**
The building society puts it partly down to people looking for bigger homes with more space as they adjust to the ""new normal"" of working from home.
Rises are set to continue in 2021, according to house price index Zoopla.
It predicts sale values will increase by 2% in Wales, compared to 1% across England.
The Principality's chief risk officer Mike Jones said fears over jobs and the economy may make first-time buyers reluctant to ""put a first step on the ladder"".
But overall, he believes the furlough extension and schemes such as mortgage deferrals are two factors keeping the sector buoyant.
""It is also potentially the desire for a lifestyle change for some who, during lockdown, have realised that it is possible to work from home, avoiding the necessity to travel to work on a daily basis,"" he added.
""The demand for larger homes with additional space, including outdoor areas, has consequently risen however, and with little new supply coming to the market, prices also rose rapidly.""
When Wales' first lockdown ended in June, house prices rose by 3% across Wales' 22 local authority areas to Â£196,165.
The Principality's house price index for July to September showed sales rose by 2.2% compared to the quarter before - however, they were down by 58% on the same period in 2019.
In September, six local authority areas reached a new record average price - Bridgend (Â£190,948), Cardiff (Â£247,030), Carmarthenshire (Â£172,708), Gwynedd (Â£198,279), Newport (Â£213,660) and Powys (Â£222,992).
Apart from Cardiff, they are all among the council areas with the highest proportion of detached or semi-detached homes, indicating to the Principality the rise is being driven by people looking for spacious homes suited to lockdown living.
The highest increase was in Gwynedd, where house prices rose by 14.6%, with the price of an average detached home rising from Â£250,000 to Â£280,000 - this was pushed up by the highest sale of the year for Â£1.2m.
Mr Jones added: ""Covid is likely to have dented consumer confidence and fears over job security may mean that many prospective buyers will be reluctant to either put a first foot on the housing ladder, or indeed take a step up.""
However, he said help-to-buy schemes and the creation of affordable homes ""gave cause for optimism"" looking ahead.
Zoopla predicts Wales will record the strongest house price growth of all UK areas next year, partly due to pent-up demand because of a longer lockdown earlier in 2020.
Director of research and insight Richard Donnell called it a ""rollercoaster year"" that was ending on a strong note, with house price growth hitting a three-year high and set to increase further.
""There are some challenges ahead as the country battles the impacts of the pandemic on the economy and day-to-day life,"" he added.
""The impact on the housing market is less than in previous downturns as sales volumes have already fallen in recent years and affordability levels are far from over-stretched.""
Monmouthshire Building Society's chief operating officer Dawn Gunter called it an ""unpredictable year"" but agreed coronavirus had changed how many people view their home.
""Lockdowns have also meant members have spent more time than usual at home, with the home becoming both a personal and professional space,"" she said.
""Lots of people took the time to consider what the future looks like, how their home environment supports a positive work-life balance, whilst also considering its location and surroundings.""
She also said the building society had seen ""a surge in first-time buyers"", adding: ""We know the average age of a first-time buyer is now in their 30s, so 2020 may have been the target year to buy a first home for many."""

You couldn’t make it up. The **MAGICC** calculator was developed by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research under funding by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the acronym stands for the **Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change** ).



And they expect us to take them seriously?



This has not been developed by a bunch of derranged ‘deniers’; no, these are ‘proper’ scientists from the gummint.



This calculator estimates just how little warming would be averted for various reductions in CO2. A very large component missing from the argument against the climate catastrophe crowd is just how little the rise in temperature would be averted by the draconian measures that are proposed. 



You can download it or play online [here](http://www.magicc.org/).



Some boffins somewhere have run the calculations for the USA with these results (truncated):



Wikipedia says New Zealand is responsible for 37 Mt CO2 and Connecticut was the closest state to that number.



James and Jacinda’s grand plan is going to bankrupt the nation, but after the gas runs out, we will warm ourselves with blankets of smug, knowing that we have stopped a temperature rise of 0.0003C by 2050 when we are “Zero Carbon”. After that it will be a runaway success of 0.0007C by 2100.



Wow! Just WOW! I am so thrilled to be alive at this time to be able to do my small bit for preventing this **climate emergency**.



I was going to bake a cake and light some candles to celebrate but then I realised that my cake candles would raise the global temperature by more than 0.0003C and ruin the whole thing.

Share this...FacebookTwitterKlimaretter, the German catastrophe-obsessed warmist site that dedicates itself to “rescuing the climate”, has a story today of the ongoing bloodbath in the German solar industry, here.
Engineering giant Bosch issued a press release in English here, where it reports that a cooling global economy has slowed the pace of growth of the Bosch Group.
But the real damage has come from its solar arm: “a likely one billion euros of impairments and losses in the difficult photovoltaics business had a significant effect on the earnings situation”.
According to klimaretter.de, Bosch’s solar arm posted an operating loss of 450 million euros in 2012. In addition, the solar arm took unplanned special depreciations totaling about 600 million euros. Therefore the losses totalled more than 1 billion euros in 2012 alone. That comes on the heels of “impairments” of 560 million and 425 million euros in 2011 and 2010 respectively.
Klimaretter.de adds:
According to Bosch, the solar arm is currently worth zero euros.”
It goes without saying, the company’s 2000 solar workers now face an extremely precarious future. Already one plant in Erfurt was shuttered at the end of the year.
Instead of focusing on saving the planet from an imaginary climate catastrophe, one that is generated by dubious models concocted by environmental kook physicists, klimaretter.de perhaps ought to focus more on real issues, like rescuing German jobs by promoting sensible policies.

Thanks to a knowledgeable commenter, **Bryan** , on Backchat the other night, [this map](https://teara.govt.nz/en/zoomify/33583/confiscation-map-1869) was drawn to our attention. It is most informative.



The text under the map says:



This **historical map** shows tribal boundaries and the areas that were **confiscated from Maori during the 1860s**. The blue boundaries have been added in modern times to identify the areas in which the confiscations took place. It notes that Waikato, the domain of the Kangitanga (Maori King movement), had 1,217,437 acres (492,679 hectares) confiscated.



  
Let’s zoom in a bit:



Well, that’s inconvenient! 



What does the SOUL protest website have to say about this land?



In 2014 Auckland City, using the Special Housing Areas Act, designated 32 hectares adjacent to the **Otuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve** (OSHR) as a special housing area (SHA. **This land, known as Puketapapa, was confiscated ‘by proclamation’ under the New Zealand Settlements Act in 1863** as part of the colonial invasion of the Waikato that drove mana whenua of South Auckland from their lands ahead of the settler armies. 



  
These protesters may have other valid reasons why they want the land protected:



It is important to understand that this land is a crucial part of one of the last remnants of the archaeologically rich stonefields landscape across Auckland and, as a natural component of the adjacent but legally separate OSHR, it holds the stories of the earliest inhabitants of our country. The OSHR protects the places where the first Maori gardeners lived and worked using the stones and the microclimates they created to grow their Pacific Crops. SHA62 similarly is one of the last surviving places where the land and stone walls used by Maori for growing new crops such as wheat and European vegetables for the Auckland markets prior to 1863, still exists. It is of special significance in that here the ancient and more recent gardens stand next to each other. These places are even rarer than the stonefields were at the time of the creation of the Otuataua Stonefields Historic Reserve. 



  
But, according to history recorded at the time, ‘confiscation’ of Maori land by Pakeha is not a valid reason. Revisionist history might want to claim something else but it seems that the facts are the opposite of what is being claimed by the rent-a-mob shambles in South Auckland.

Poll now closed. Results below will be submitted to ARCUS on Sept 1st.

Once again, I’m going to give WUWT readers an opportunity to make a forecast for submission, based on voting. See the poll at the end. I’m late getting this online this month as other things took precedence.
For reference, here’s last months forecast poll and the final submission with all other forecasts from other groups. The final forecast poll you can participate in follows.

The value used by ARCUS in the forecast is the NSIDC value as they say here:
The sea ice monthly extent for September 2010 was 4.9 million square kilometers, based on National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) estimates.
So don’t be using the JAXA graph to forecast minimums, though it it useful for determining short term trends as it is more responsive than the NSDIC graph below, which is averaged.
Right now the NSIDC value is about 5 million square kilometers.
[ UPDATE: NSIDC’s Julienne Strove from NSIDC writes in comments:
“Note, the NSIDC value today is 4.66 million sq-km.”
Of course NSDIC doesn’t publish the daily values like JAXA does, so we all have to guess since we aren’t privy to that information.
The 5 day average graph is all the public gets. And of course, any estimate is hampered not only by the average, but also by those coarseness of the Y axis. I’ve asked before for NSIDC to publish the daily value and the response has been that they have more important issues to attend to.  However, clearly the ARCUS forecast group is watching this number and it is important to the final forecast done by over a dozen groups now. So you think it would be valuable to post the daily data. -Anthony]

Here’s the poll for the ARCUS August outlook, it will run until Sept 1st at midnight PST.
(NOTE/UPDATE: This poll was originally exactly like all the others done over the last several months, but one snarky commenter (the first one) complained that I was a “manipulator” because it didn’t have more lower values. Of course he never bother to ask why or look at the history of the other polls.
I had considered initially adding those lower values for this poll, but then figured I’d be derided for changing the poll and not being consistent with the other polls. In retrospect, I’ll be criticized no matter what I do, so within 20 minutes of it going online, I decided to extend this poll with 0.1 million km increments down to 4.0 million kilometers. I’ve also removed the options for voting 5.5 to 6.0 (which existed in prior polls) since they are outside the current bounds of possibility based on previous September history.  – Anthony

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site recently posted an article about the East African drought, which, as it turns out, is all part of a natural cycle.
================================================
New Study in Nature: East African Drought Trend Part of a Natural Cycle
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)

East Africa has gotten drier over the last decades, suffering from drought. Those responsible for this misery were quickly found: It had to be man. His rising CO2 emissions must have irreversibly damaged the East African climate, and driven the rains off for good. This is pretty much how many environmental and aid organizations have been arguing, e.g. Aktion Deutschland Hilft or Greenpeace. Of course, you don’t have to be a marketing expert or psychologist to see the real intentions of these accusations. With feelings of guilt, donations come pouring in.
Now a new publication in the journal Nature casts serious doubt on the supposed man-made East African drought assumption. US scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, led by Jessica Tierney, have taken a closer look at moisture trends in East Africa and have uncovered a surprise. Using geological reconstructions, the scientists were indeed able to confirm that East Africa has dried out during the past decade. However, the group also succeeded in reconstructing the data all the way back to the year 1300 (See Figure 1 above).
As Figure 1 shows, the drought of the last decade is simply all part of a broader natural cycle that has been occurring over hundreds of years. Contrary to what was assumed earlier, the drying out did not first begin in the second half of the 20th century, but already at the end of the 18th century. A pronounced wet period prevailed in East Africa between 1680 and 1765 (Figure 1), which corresponds to the Little Ice Age – a time when global mean temperature was more than 1°C colder than today. Interestingly, East Africa was just as dry back in the 14th and 15th centuries as it is today. Clearly CO2 could not have been responsible for that.
Therefore Jessica Tierney and her team started looking for a natural driver for East Africa’s moisture development. They compared the drought data with the temperature development in the Indian Ocean. Lo and behold: both curves showed a high degree of similarity. Obviously the rain in East Africa is driven significantly by the Indian Ocean. Whenever the India Ocean is cool, the rains in East Africa increase. And when the Indian Ocean is warm, the rains become more seldom (see Figure 2):

In turns out that the temperature curve of the Makassar Strait near Indonesia also closely reflects global mean temperature (Figure 3). During the Medieval Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period, drought conditions prevailed in East Africa. But wet conditions ruled during the Little Ice Age. We also know that this climatic behavior over decades and centuries happens to follow solar activity. Thus moisture development in East Africa is mainly driven by solar activity.
Unfortunately the authors of this Nature study “forgot” to mention it – even though it’s made obvious by the data. The results are no surprise because numerous other studies from different parts across the world show the same distinct patterns, for example: here, here, here, and here, just to name a few from many.

"Irradiated plants taken from the evacuated areas around the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant have been reported to cause growth abnormalities and early death when fed to butterfly larvae, according to a paper published in Nature’s Scientific Reports journal. The larvae of the Pale Grass Blue butterfly (Zizeeria maha) from Okinawa, 1,000km south Fukushima which the authors describe as likely the least polluted locality in Japan, were fed fresh leaves containing radioactive caesium (137Cs and 134Cs) to examine the effects. While such studies of the effects of exposure to ionising radiation are important to improve our scientific understanding of the risks involved, it’s unfortunate that the authors of the study chose to delay publishing their estimates of the dose rates their butterflies had received. Because we’re quite sure that if they had done so in this paper then they’d have questioned their own conclusions. Using openly available software such as Erica, the authors could have estimated a dose rate (radiological dose, measured in Gray per hour) for their stated LD50 (the lethal dose required to kill 50% of exposed individuals). We estimate this to be around 8 μGy per hour (micro-Gray, one millionth of a Gray), assuming a worst case in which the larvae retained all the caesium they ingested over the period of around 12 days.  This is likely to be a considerable overestimate of the dose they actually received, given the levels of radioactivity detected in those larvae that had died, which were around three orders of magnitude lower than the estimate we’ve used. The dose rate from natural background radiation is typically in the micro-Gray per hour range. Consequently, the LD50 dose the authors report is close to the levels of radiation that organisms are normally exposed to from natural sources. The implication of this is that organisms would be at risk everywhere – yet this is a situation that is clearly not the case. While there are few studies on butterflies, the existing scientific literature on invertebrates suggests that the LD50 for subadult live-stages is at least 1 Gray (requiring, over 12 days, more than 400 times the dose rate we estimate for the authors LD50). Consequently, the authors’ claim that their results suggest “that the Pale Grass Blue butterfly is generally resistant to internal radiation exposure. The possible biological impacts of much lower radiation levels will be the subject of future investigations” demonstrates a worrying lack of awareness of current scientific knowledge. Unfortunately a more detailed analysis is difficult due to the lack of information provided in the paper. While all of the treated larvae (except the control) showed similar mortality and abnormality rates, the authors also acknowledge an error in the number of individuals in the control group, which leaves the reader at a loss as to whether this has any impact on the results. There are also some technical errors in the paper. For instance they record dose in Becquerel (Bq), which is a measure of the rate of radioactive decays per second. Yet radioactive dose is properly measured in Gray (Gy), equivalent to a joule of radiated energy absorbed by a kilogramme of mass. The authors state their observations support the linear no-threshold (LNT) model, yet the LNT model does not relate to deterministic (as reported in this paper) effects.  We welcome papers investigating the impact of ionising radiation on wildlife, but these basic errors show we must ensure that the peer review of such papers involves scientists from an appropriate range of disciplines. It’s been noted that many papers purporting to show significant radiological impacts on wildlife are appearing in journals not usually focused on or specialising in radiation protection."
"Chinese wildlife faces a serious survival crisis, but the tide seems to be turning in support for protecting endangered species there. China’s top legislative body has passed a new “interpretation” of their criminal law that will allow authorities to jail people who knowingly eat products made from rare wild animals. They could potentially face sentences of more than ten years. Chinese consumption of wildlife has long been the target of external criticism. An explosion in wealth has created a swelling middle class with a voracious appetite for valuables, collectibles, luxury goods and exotic foods. Eating endangered species has become a status symbol, with government officials some of the main culprits. Now, support is growing within China against the way wildlife is treated and consumed. Chinese people have a reputation for eating anything with four legs that’s not a table. But the culinary sub-culture of eating all manner of creatures that was traditionally limited to South China and practised at times of extreme food scarcity, became a national passion with the country’s economic boom. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to justify a host of practices that exploit endangered animals in the wild and in captivity. Although China removed rhino horns and tiger parts from the active list of traditional ingredients in 1993, the belief in their “unparalleled healing power” remains alive among practitioners and members of the Chinese scientific community. Experiments in rhino farming and the controversial tiger farming can only sustain the belief in the unique medicinal effects of rhino horns and tiger bones. Braised tiger meat, stewed monkey legs and bear paws, shredded pangolin, snake and turtle soup, and barbecued crocodile meat are sending traders to places as far as Russian Siberia, disputed waters of the South China Sea, North America, and the African Continent. Not only does Chinese wildlife face a serious survival crisis as a result, this appetite for endangered animals is a threat to wildlife everywhere. China’s wildlife policy is contradictory. It adopted the Wildlife Protection Law in 1988. To critics, the law is more resource management legislation than a wildlife protection act as wildlife is designated as a natural resource. This places the focus on how it can best serve human consumption. In the context of the national obsession with economic growth, wildlife has become an abused resource. At a local level, catering businesses that serve exotic foods and farming operations that brutalise captive wildlife animals are protected by local officials. The owner of a major bear farm in Northeast China was showered with all kinds of honours. He was made a deputy to the provincial people’s congress, the highest honour a business person can receive from the government. The result is that more species have become endangered since the Wildlife Protection Law’s adoption and businesses exploiting endangered animals have thrived, seemingly with the law’s endorsement. Plus, trade across provinces has developed and now forms part of an international operation. But China is changing and the new interpretation of China’s criminal law is a political step that reflects changing attitudes to the treatment of animals. To China’s increasingly vocal animal activists and members of its “one-child” generation, the exploitation of wildlife for human benefits is not only selfish and short-sighted, but also self-destructive. Bear farming is one example where public opinion has experienced a sea change. In the early 1990s, bear farming was praised by the government, in the media, and in all other official propaganda programs as a production that saves wild bears, glorifies Chinese culture, serves the interest of public health, and contributes to poverty reduction and economic growth. Today, bear farming is condemned by the media and the public in general, largely as a result of efforts by the Animals Asia Foundation’s China Bear Rescue campaign. The latest policy can also be seen as an important legal measure to support President Xi Jinping’s crackdown against extravagant consumption by government officials. Since the adoption of his austerity policy, shark fin consumption in the last Chinese New Year dropped significantly. Soon after the policy’s release, a provincial legislator was dismissed for possessing 33 ivory tusks and is under criminal investigation. A wider animal protection movement is also gathering momentum and challenging patterns of eating that are promoted by business interests. It was response to public pressure that made the government halt the introduction of American rodeos and Spanish bull-fighting to the domestic Chinese audience. It was also public pressure that brought about the elimination of shark fin from official catering events. Development in China is increasingly seen not just in economic terms, but in an appreciation for quality of life and a desire for the government to take a moral lead. Wildlife protection is a crucial component of this. As a rising superpower, the Chinese government’s actions for wildlife protection will not only enhance its legitimacy domestically, but internationally too."

Greens veteran Bob Brown has suddenly discovered that he isn’t that keen on wind farms after all. After years of sneering at we the Luddites, who objected to the ugly, “bat-chomping bird-slicing eco-crucifixes”, the announcement of plans to build a colossal wind farm in Tasmania has had a galvanising effect on the former Greens leader.



Former Greens leader and veteran activist Bob Brown is campaigning to stop a $1.6 billion wind farm development in Tasmania because it will spoil the view and kill birds.



The sheer scale of this proposed development beggars belief.



The proposed Robbins Island wind farm in Tasmania’s northwest will be one of the world’s biggest, with up to 200 towers measuring 270m high from ground to blade tip.



If it goes ahead, electricity from the Robbins Island project will be sent to the mainland via a new ­undersea cable to help make Tasmania a “battery for the nation”.



These turbines will be taller than the New Plymouth power station chimney, and 80% of the height of the Auckland Sky Tower. **All 200 of them.**



No wonder Bob Brown’s had a change of heart.



Despite the criticisms levelled at former prime minister Tony Abbott and treasurer Joe Hockey for describing wind turbines as “ugly”, Dr Brown said the Robbins Island plan was, visually, a step too far. “Mariners will see this hairbrush of tall towers from 50km out to sea and elevated landlubbers will see it, like it or not, from greater distances on land,” Dr Brown said. “Its eye-catchiness will divert from every coastal scene on the western Bass Strait coastline.”



The greatest hypocrisy of the Green movement regarding wind turbines has been their shameful silence about the toll wreaked on wildlife. The same activists who have been trying to stop a coal mine because of a single finch, have said nothing as dozens of threatened species are minced into oblivion by wind turbines.



In his letter on the wind farm, Dr Brown wrote: “Besides the impact on the coastal scenery, wind turbines kill birds. Wedge-tailed eagle and white-bellied sea eagles nest and hunt on the island. Swift parrots and orange-bellied parrots traverse the island on their migrations.”



He listed the multiple species of international migratory, endangered and critically endangered shorebirds that used the wetlands for six months of the year. They included Australian fairy tern, fork-tailed swift, little tern, white-throated needletail, ruddy turnstone, sharp-tailed sandpiper, sanderling, red knot, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stint, great knot, double-banded plover, greater sand plover, lesser sand plover, Latham’s snipe, bar-tailed godwit, eastern curlew, whimbrel, golden plover, grey plover, grey-tailed tattler, common greenshank, terek sandpiper, hooded plover.



  
As Brown belatedly discovers his conscience regarding the whirling engines of bird and bat death, his Green mates are ducking for cover.



The response from the Greens party and environment groups to Dr Brown’s outburst was as quiet as a wind rotor on a dead-calm day.



The Greens and Australian Conservation Foundation refused to criticise either Dr Brown or the project, slated to be one of the ­biggest wind farms in the world if it goes ahead.



In the past, federal Greens leader Richard Di Natale has likened investigating complaints about wind farms and noise to taking ­seriously alien abductions.



He refused to support the appointment of a wind farm commissioner to handle public com­plaints. His staff yesterday said he did not wish to comment on his former leader’s protest.



  
Bob Brown is undoubtedly a hypocrite. But for once, though, he’s also right. The proposed wind farm in north-west Tasmania is mind-boggling. The climate-conscious voters of inner-Sydney wouldn’t for an instant countenance such a monster on the windy cliffs of Bondi. Out of their sight, out of mind here in Tasmania just isn’t good enough.

"Pope Francis has admitted to moments of selfishness while living in lockdown at the Vatican, and has saluted people on the frontline of the fight against the coronavirus, including doctors and shop workers, as “the saints who live next door”. With characteristic frankness, the pope said he struggled with “self-preoccupation” in a largely solitary existence. “Of course I have my areas of selfishness. On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there,” he said in an interview published in the Catholic weekly the Tablet. He added: “I’m thinking at this time of the saints who live next door. They are heroes – doctors, volunteers, religious sisters, priests, shop workers – all performing their duty so that society can continue functioning. How many doctors and nurses have died! How many religious sisters have died! All serving … If we become aware of this miracle of the next-door saints, if we can follow their tracks, the miracle will end well, for the good of all.” Responding to questions put to him by Austen Ivereigh, the British author of a papal biography, Francis spoke of the hypocrisy of politicians who talk about facing up to the coronavirus crisis sweeping the globe while failing to tackle the environmental emergency, supporting a “throwaway culture”, and continuing to manufacture weapons. “It’s true, a number of governments have taken exemplary measures to defend the population on the basis of clear priorities. But we’re realising that all our thinking, like it or not, has been shaped around the economy. “In the world of finance it has seemed normal to sacrifice [people], to practise a politics of the throwaway culture, from the beginning to the end of life … It’s a culture of euthanasia, either legal or covert, in which the elderly are given medication but only up to a point.” The coronavirus crisis put a spotlight on people’s values. “I am worried by the hypocrisy of certain political personalities who speak of facing up to the crisis, of the problem of hunger in the world, but who in the meantime manufacture weapons. This is a time to be converted from this kind of functional hypocrisy. It’s a time for integrity. Either we are coherent with our beliefs or we lose everything.” The climate crisis had been forgotten in the focus on the pandemic, he said. “Who now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of the floods? I don’t know if these are the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature’s responses.” He added: “Today I believe we have to slow down our rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand and contemplate the natural world. We need to reconnect with our real surroundings … “Let us not lose our memory once all this is past, let us not file it away and go back to where we were. This is the time to take the decisive step, to move from using and misusing nature to contemplating it. We have lost the contemplative dimension; we have to get it back at this time.” This was the moment to focus on the poor, the homeless and those on the margins. “But the poor are hidden, because poverty is bashful. In Rome recently, in the midst of the quarantine, a policeman said to a man: ‘You can’t be on the street, go home.’ The response was: “I have no home. I live in the street.’ To discover such a large number of people who are on the margins … They are there but we don’t see them: they have become part of the landscape; they are things.” In Europe, he said, “when we are beginning to hear populist speeches and witness political decisions of [a] selective kind, it’s all too easy to remember Hitler’s speeches in 1933, which were not so different from some of the speeches of a few European politicians now”. Pope Francis described life under lockdown in the Santa Marta residence, where he lives. “We now have two shifts for meals, which helps a lot to alleviate the impact. Everyone works in his office or from his room, using technology. Everyone is working; there are no idlers here. “How am I living this spiritually? I’m praying more, because I feel I should. And I think of people. That’s what concerns me: people. Thinking of people anoints me, it does me good, it takes me out of my self-preoccupation. Of course I have my areas of selfishness. On Tuesdays, my confessor comes, and I take care of things there. “I’m living this as a time of great uncertainty. It’s a time for inventing, for creativity.” People could “either get depressed and alienated … or we can get creative”. But it was not easy to be confined to the home, he said. “The counsel is not to give up, but save yourself for better times, for in those times remembering what has happened will help us. Take care of yourselves for a future that will come. And remembering in that future what has happened will do you good.” Asked if he had a message for the elderly who were self-isolating and for confined young people, he said: “The elderly continue to be our roots. And they must speak to the young. This tension between young and old must always be resolved in the encounter with each other. Because the young person is bud and foliage, but without roots they cannot bear fruit. The elderly are the roots.”"

Sunset Clause for the C-Tax? 
Letter to the Editor
Watts Up With That?
30 July 2011
Australians must insist that the monstrous carbon dioxide tax legislation has a sunset clause which is triggered by global cooling.
This whole tax extravaganza is based on the foolish notion that man’s production of life-sustaining carbon dioxide controls global temperature and we need a C-Tax to stop it.

However no one has produced evidence that carbon dioxide exclusively controls the climate. What’s more, carbon dioxide production is rising strongly but world temperature has been stable for the last 13 years. Right now sea surface temperatures are falling sharply.
“Climate” is generally defined as an average of 30 years of weather. Therefore the C-Tax should be scrapped immediately the global temperature falls below the 30 year average temperature, indicating the start of global cooling.
As the sun has gone quiet, and Queensland has just had its coldest autumn for at least 60 years, this looks likely to happen soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new working paper titled Climate Skeptics In Germany And Their War Against The Energy Revolution by the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Vienna, written by Dr. Achim Brunnengräber of the University of Berlin Department of Political Science, has just been released.
What’s a bit surprising is that the Catholic Theological Private Institute of Linz contributed to this hate-tinged, highly confrontational, intolerant working paper, which is designed to further demonize those with a different opinion. Obviously elements of Catholicism have regressed back to the good old Galileo days when doctrine was not to be challenged. You could view it as a Redeclaration of War on Skeptics.
Moreover, what is especially frightening is that Brunnengräber appears to be totally unaware of the massive body of recent scientific research and data refuting the IPCC climate science.
Indeed, a stunning blow was delivered to the author, and the overall renewable energy movement, just days ago when Angela Merkel’s Environment Minister Peter Altmaier announced that the German transition to renewable energy would end up costing citizens a spectacular 1 trillion euros by the end of the 2030s, de facto confirming the project is a colossal flop that threatens the existence of the nation. He is now working to put the brakes on.
The paper’s introduction (p. 7) states that the public is getting increasingly unsettled about the burdens coming from Germany’s energy revolution, and writes that “people who deny man-made climate change, play down its impacts, or fundamentally question climate policy appear to be gaining ground in this atmosphere. In Germany, their voices are becoming increasingly louder and are getting greater attention from politics, media, and the broad public.”
Paper’s “surprising results”:
The introduction presents the paper’s three main results:
1. There are more and more signs that the climate skeptics in Germany are gaining political ground and attention.
2. The denial of climate change is, however, no longer the central issue. The skeptics are focussing their criticism increasingly on the political consequences that resulted from climate change.
3. This leads to questioning the transition to renewable energy. Thus the positions of the climate skeptics are gaining acceptance and are finding support – also from prominent figures.
The report then asks if a similarly strong debate like the one that has long been found in the USA could appear in Germany. Brunnengräber advises that the skeptics should not be taken lightly, and suggests the possibility of that happening is real, and that there are “substantial reasons against ignoring them“.
Brunnengräber begins by defining and fingering out the skeptic forces, putting focus on The Heartland Institute, CFACT and Fred Singer in USA; and the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt, journalists Dirk Maxeiner, Ulli Kulke and Günter Ederer in Germany, and claiming that climate skepticism is based on the findings of “dubious” scientists, all designed to spread doubt and uncertainty among the public. The report drags out the old, worn-out claims that skeptics are being massively funded by “the oil industry, its think tanks, and massive financial resources“.
Brunnengräber accuses the skeptics of defamation. In section 7.5 on page 44, he describes the skeptic network in Germany as:
…”a colorful heap of blogging amateur climatologists (most being retired professors), a handful of lobbyists, politicians and hobby scientists. Singer here plays an important role at the EIKE events in Germany, and is always a welcome guest. Among the speakers are Christopher Monckton, a conservative politician from Great Britain and Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.”
Through the conferences…
…with the international guests – the network of climate skeptics in Germany is spreading more and more. Moreover, there is contact with the Global Warming Policy Foundation.”

Skepticism in Germany “increasingly a problem”.
The report writes at the end of section 7.5:
Climate skeptics are being viewed by many German politicians and scientists increasingly as a problem (Hornschuh 2008: 149). Yet, there is little or no direct contact between climate deniers and their opponents. The conflicts are playing out via the media. The one exception confirms the rule: In May 2011, there was a meeting between EIKE members and representatives of the Potsdam Institute (PIK), but whose content was not released to the media. An open discussion appears to be impossible because the “absolute skepticism of the climate skeptics immunizes against counter-arguments.”
Here, Brunnengräber forgets to mention that it was the PIK who requested that the meeting’s content not be released, and that it is the PIK’s scientists who refuse to debate in public.
In the paper’s summary, Brunnengräber concludes (concedes) that the skeptic movement in Germany is now “well-embedded institutionally” with groups like EIKE, the Manhattan Institute, TvR media Publishing, the blog Achse des Guten, and some professors at various universities. One expert team suggests that “the strength and success of the skeptics does not come from prominent, renowned scientists or experts, but from a network of climate skeptics that connects protagonists from science, media, private industry, and politics“.
Brunnengräber also points out that presence of skeptical positions in the media has increased since the 2009 Copenhagen conference. Stefan Rahmstorf once ostracized (p. 43) the German mainstream media, e.g. Spiegel, FAZ, Die Welt, RTL, etc., for giving the skeptics attention, accusing them of “unfiltered presentation, poor quality control, and referring to skeptics as “experts”.
Brunnengräber’s paper claims to welcome scientific debate (so long you don’t disagree) p 11:
Here a healthy measure of skepticism is essential for every scientific step forward and for the process of gathering knowledge. Doubt belongs to human thinking […] without which science is unimaginable. However, criticism must be factual, sound and based on science. But here this appears not to be always the case. The German science skeptical debate on climate change is not only an unhealthy skepticism, but it is characterized by an absolute negation and rejection of all data showing an anthropogenic, i.e. man-made climate change.”
The source of that quote used here by Brunnengräber is radical environmental group Germanwatch.
Merkel fears a planet with 9 billion people…
Even Angela Merkel shows hints of being unconvinced by the climate science, and supports the transition to green energy moreso because of an irrational fear she has of a planet inhabited by 9 billion humans all wanting to be prosperous, which she recently revealed at a WBGU meeting. Page 10 of the report quotes Merkel:
I always lump climate change and resource efficiency together as one issue because I have no desire to argue with doubters on whether or not climate change is so bad or if it will be that bad. Just the fact that we are approaching 9 billion people on the planet shows that those among us who don’t believe in climate change have to change their thinking.”
Stunning. Based on that, for Merkel, the discussion is over.
Her big worry seems to be the 9 billion people we will soon have on the planet, and making sure there is enough Lebensraum…a seemingly incurable, neurotic obsession among many Germans in power.
Finally on the author, Brunnengräber, one Dutch expert wrote in an e-mail to me: “These Austrian authors (political scientists and sociologists, I
presume) have still not understood that climate scepticism is based on evidence and science.”
It’s what one calls: expertise based on ignorance.

_The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.



Prior to April, 2011, issues of this Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





Three weeks ago, the National Academies of Sciences’ National Research Council (NRC) released a report _Sea‐​Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past, Present, and Future_. You can find it at: (http://​www8​.nation​ala​cad​e​mies​.org/​o​n​p​i​n​e​w​s​/​n​e​w​s​i​t​e​m​.​a​s​p​x​?​R​e​c​o​r​d​I​D​=​13389).



The apparent intent of the report was to raise global warming alarm by projecting rapidly rising seas (some two to three times higher than estimates from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)) — along the California coast and elsewhere.



Unfortunately, to produce such a large and rapid sea level rise, the NRC had to throw overboard a lot of good science and do a lot of cherry‐​picking of the rest.



Of course global sea level will continue to rise, with or without human‐​induced climate change, as readers will see below. The NRC projects a wildly high upper bound of some 4–5 feet this century, while, in reality, the rate of future rise will likely be closer to the rise observed during the 20th century, about 8–12 inches. Coastal residents adapted to this with little or no overt effort.



How the NRC came up with a global sea level rise by the year 2100 of some 50 to 140 cm (20 to 55 inches) — is an example of using only a careful selection of available data and turning a deaf ear to warnings (made by the scientists themselves) of its unreliability for long‐​term projections.



How did the NRC come up with such an enormous rise in sea level?



They independently projected the sea level rise from its two major components — ocean thermal expansion (from increasing ocean temperatures) and water input from the melting of ice — and then added them together.



But for each component, their high end projections are very likely much too high. And in combination, they represent something that is virtually impossible.



Consider thermal expansion. The NRC simply used the 21st century temperature change projections from the IPCC’s 2007 collection of climate models. Is there a problem here?



Since they started in 2001, the IPCC model projections have warmed at a rate over twice what is being observed in reality. So, if the current global temperature behavior under rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations is any indication of the future behavior under rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations, then the future projections of the sea level rise due to the thermal expansion of ocean water are grossly overestimated. The NRC did not even consider such a possibility, instead preferring to base their projections on the assumption that the future climate behavior will depart radically from the current climate behavior, i.e. throwing out observations in favor of what appear to be failing climate models. This model‐​based method produces a lot more sea level rise than extrapolating observations would produce.



Which brings us to the NRC projections for the other element of sea level rise — melting of land‐​based ice, primarily from Greenland and Antarctica. For this projection, the NRC turned their previous methodology on its head, and opted to extrapolate current trends (to the absurd) rather than rely on ice models. In this case, the models yield much less sea level rise than the NRC extrapolation of current trends.



This is how the NRC describes its method:



The base‐​rate extrapolation assumes that present‐​day observed trends in loss rates continue in the future.



And to get even _more_ sea level rise than current trends allow, the NRC additionally does this:



Increased ice discharge beyond presently observed rates was simulated by extrapolating a multiple of present‐​day observed discharge forward in time to 2100.



For example, here is how they handled ice loss from Greenland



For Greenland, the average speed of all outlet glaciers was increased by 2 km yr‐​1, equivalent to a net discharge of 375.1 GT yr‐​1. These values are consistent with the observed doubling of Greenland’s mass balance deficit between ca. 1996 and 2000.



For what it’s worth, the current ice discharge rate from Greenland, as determined from an improved satellite algorithm (Wu et al., 2010) is 104 GT/​yr — less than a third of the NRC’s high end case.



The result is that the NRC projects that by 2100, Greenland will have contributed between 14.8 cm and 33.8 cm (5.8 in. to 13.3 in.) to global sea level rise, with their best projection of 20.1 ± 2.7 cm (7.9 ± 1.1in.).



Is this at all realistic? In a word, no.



There has been a whole lot of research published in recent years (and covered by _The Current Wisdom_ ) on ice loss from Greenland’s glaciers. In virtually all cases, previously hypothesized mechanisms for a prolonged rapid speed‐​up of Greenland’s glaciers have been debunked.



And as to the reliability of extrapolating future trends into the future, here are a few relevant quotes:



From Van der Wahl et al., _Science_ , 2008:



“Longer observational records with high temporal resolution in other ablation areas of the [Greenland] ice sheet are necessary to test the importance of the positive‐​feedback mechanism between melt rates and ice velocities. At present, we cannot conclude that this feedback is important.”



From Nick et al., _Nature Geosciences_ , 2009:



“Our results imply that the recent rates of mass loss in Greenland’s outlet glaciers are transient and should not be extrapolated into the future.”



And most recently, from Moon et al., _Science_ , 2012:



“Finally, our observations have implications for recent work on sea level rise. Earlier research used a kinematic approach to estimate upper bounds of 0.8 to 2.0 m for 21st‐​century sea level rise. In Greenland, this work assumed ice-sheet–wide doubling of glacier speeds (low‐​end scenario) or an order of magnitude increase in speeds (high‐​end scenario) from 2000 to 2010. Our wide sampling of actual 2000 to 2010 changes shows that glacier acceleration across the ice sheet remains far below these estimates, suggesting that sea level rise associated with Greenland glacier dynamics remains well below the low‐​end scenario (9.3 cm by 2100) at present. Continued acceleration, however, may cause sea level rise to approach the low‐​end limit by this century’s end.”



So, even though the authors of papers reporting on the recent glacier flow rates in Greenland say that current rates should not be extrapolated into the future and that even the current glacial acceleration of flow rate produces only very minimal contributions of sea level rise from Greenland, the NRC authors decide not only to go ahead and extrapolate current rates into the future, but then, for good measure, to increase the flow even more on top of that. This assures an extreme value of sea level rise from the contribution of melting ice.



Combine a too large estimate from ocean thermal expansion with a too large estimate from ice melt, and you get an alarming amount of sea level rise. Crank it up even higher with more unrealistic assumptions about ice behavior in the future and you get a high end sea level rise projection (55 inches) that is some two times larger than the highest IPCC estimate. This kind of alarmism may get you on MSNBC, but that doesn’t mean it’s right.



And there is much more to find fault with in the NRC sea level rise report.



Another topic that we have covered in _The Current Wisdom_ on several occasions has been the recent research examining the contribution to sea level rise from non‐​climate related human activities. These activities can both act to lower sea level (by impounding water behind dams) and to raise it (by extracting water from aquifers that eventually finds a way into the oceans). Several researchers have been working to compile a temporal history of these effects on a global scale across much of the past 100 years. What they have found is that early‐​on, a lot of dams were being built, and more water was being impounded than was being pumped out of aquifers. The net result was a negative contribution to sea level rise. But in recent years, the rate of dam building has declined and the rate of groundwater extraction increased to the point where, starting in about the early 1980s, the net effect is a positive contribution to sea level rise. Over past decade or so, that contribution has been responsible for some 15–25% of the observed sea level rise.



But the NRC largely sets aside this topic, asserting:



The contributions of groundwater withdrawal and reservoir storage to sea‐​level change remain poorly constrained, largely due to sparse data and inadequate models. Each process likely has a significant but opposite effect on sea‐​level change, on the order of 0.5 mm per year.



In our last _Current Wisdom_ article, we showed that the acceleration in the rate of sea level rise apparent during the past 50 years or so in the historical sea level record from tide gauges is completely explained by the history of anthropogenic alterations to the flow of water into the oceans (i.e., impoundment and dewatering).



This has an impact on the apportionment of observed sea level rise into its various components, which of course has an impact on our understanding of the various influences and controls.



For instance, the NRC determines that the current rate of contribution to sea level rise from ice loss from Greenland is 0.56 ± 0.13 mm/​yr (0.02 inches/​year) and from Antarctica is 0.37 ± 0.14mm/yr (0.01 inch/​year). The NRC arrives at these numbers by using a weighted average of several recently published estimates made by various methodologies and from various research groups. But one of the estimates is much lower than the others — the one from Wu et al. (2010). Long‐​time _Wisdom_ fans may recognize this citation as we discussed it in the very first _Wisdom_ that we wrote back in the fall of 2010 (https://​www​.cato​.org/​t​h​e​-​c​u​r​r​e​n​t​-​w​i​sdom/).



Wu et al. (2010) determined that all the other estimates of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica that were being derived from the satellite measured gravity fields (using the GRACE satellite) were in error as they were arrived at by using an improperly calibrated glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model — that is, a model of how the land surface has been slowly responding since the removal of the large ice burden of the Last Ice Age. When Wu et al. (2010) supplied a better model, the ice loss estimated dropped considerably. Wu et al. calculated that ice loss from Greenland was occurring at a rate of 0.29 ± 0.06 mm/​yr and 0.23 ± 0.12mm/yr from Antarctica. According to Wu et al. (2010):



“We conclude that a significant revision of the present estimates of glacial isostatic adjustments and land–ocean water exchange is required.”



But the NRC buries this result in a multi‐​estimate average. This certainly produces the wrong answer. Either the other studies, using the old GIA model are correct and Wu et al. is wrong, or else, as concluded by Wu et al., the other studies are wrong and the Wu et al. numbers are closer to being correct. And if Wu et al. are correct, then the NRC is wrong.



Is there good evidence that the ice loss rates calculated by Wu et al. (2010) are correct?



In the past two years, the central estimate of the average amount of water contributed to the global oceans from non‐​climate activities is about 0.4 mm/​yr (from Wada et al., 2012), and the amount contributed from ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is 0.52mm/yr (from Wu et al., 2010). Together, this sums to 0.92 mm/​yr. But according to the NRC, the net human non‐​climate contribution is near zero, and the net Greenland and Antarctic contribution is 0.93 mm/​yr. So the sea level budget continues to close, no matter which of these sets of results is used. But if the Wada/​Wu set is correct, then it means that ice loss is contributing just a tad but more than half of what the NRC cooked up, which must mean that ice loss from Greenland and Antarctic is much less sensitive to rising temperatures than determined by the NRC.



At the very, very least, the NRC should have at least separately included the Wada/​Wu possibility, rather than largely tossing it out.



Doomsaying from the NRC is unfortunately the expected result when science careers are enhanced by the presence massive amounts of taxpayer funds, which tend to get doled out to those who cry “wolf” the loudest. This phenomenon, which ultimately results in very bad public policy, is something we are now studying intently here at Cato.

"Footage of Google’s prototype driverless car has got people talking about the potential for self-driving vehicles. While this seems like an exciting new technological advance, in fact the idea is not so new, with numerous large car manufacturers having carried out their own autonomous car programmes as far back as the 1920s, with a “magic highway” system developed in California in the 1990s. It is important that we have a debate about what form cars of the future should take, because personal mobility is an increasingly pressing problem in terms of its environmental impact and sustainability. There are more than a billion cars on the world’s roads – a figure that has doubled over the past 25 years, swelling with the rise of car ownership in the rapidly developing economies such as Brazil, China, and India. With transport responsible for a fifth of global oil use and forecast to be the chief source of future oil use and emissions growth, this is a destructive trend that cannot be sustained for the long term without compromising future generations. In response to the dominance of the internal combustion engine, electric cars have emerged as an alternative. Switching fuels from oil to electricity overcomes much of the dependence on oil and can cut the emissions produced. Governments have introduced subsidies and tax reductions to encourage consumers, public sector bodies and commercial fleets to shift towards electric vehicles. But while manufacturers have brought a steady stream of electrified vehicles to market, sales remain low, costs high, infrastructure insufficient, and standards – such as competing types of charger – have yet to settle. So, as it stands, electric vehicles are not yet considered an attractive alternative for everyone. However, cars that drive themselves could challenge the status quo, changing our relationship with cars and pulling more drivers into the sphere of electric vehicles. They could be shared, increasing sociability and social inclusion, and offering an opportunity to those unable to buy a car outright. Google’s model in fact moves away from private ownership, taking the risk out of substantial investment decisions. Only for use over short distances, concerns about fuel, range and other worries would not be a concern. Another effect of self-driving cars might be to encourage more cycling and walking, as roads full of automatically-driven cars will (we hope) be safer – drivers are after all prone to fatigue, mood changes, emotional impulses, distraction or intoxication. In contrast, self-driving cars are computer controlled, so there will be no impulsive or hasty decisions that could lead to injury. The cars are also programmed to avoid certain obstacles – a child running into the road would trigger the sensors, for example. And towns and cities that are more accommodating to cyclists and pedestrians means a lower carbon footprint for the daily commute. For those who cannot drive, for example through disability or age, cars that drive themselves would help connect cut-off communities, and provide a means of transport and so a way of maintaining personal independence. Even those under the legal driving age could benefit from the a means of transport that doesn’t require a driver. Of course, there are drawbacks too, chief of which is that introducing self-driving cars might encourage more vehicles onto the roads. Rather than replace existing cars, Google’s new cars might be bought as additional cars. They might actually compete with public transport such as buses, trains and metro systems – Google are positioning the cars as a replacement for taxis. If so, instead of improving transport sustainability, autonomous cars could end up generating more journeys, requiring more power, and generate more emissions (from electrical power and from manufacture). And again, Google’s driverless cars will benefit short-distance urban travellers more than those in less connected rural areas, as they require strong internet connections for access to maps and GPS systems. Both are commonplace in cities, but less so in the countryside where transport is more keenly needed. In the UK, 87% of rural dwellers hold driving licenses, compared with only 65% for those in built-up metropolitan areas, falling to 62% in London. Google’s futuristic cars won’t benefit those countryside communities suffering from transport poverty. So, in this outpouring of futuristic comment on Google’s driverless cars, while it raises an interesting debate about mobility that needs to be had, neither we nor those designing it should pretend the driverless car holds the solutions to the 21st-century transport we need to start planning for."

Sell the idea that men can be women and women can be men, and Bob’s your uncle (or aunt) and there will be an argument or a passionate debate between those that agree or disagree.

In the old days, the advice on running a successful get together was to avoid the subjects of politics and religion and to stick to discussing the weather. Well, that is now off limits.

I loved those ads! 



Now TV is full of blended families, same-sex families and diversity driven marketing that have caused me to boycott so many brands that I am back to the farmers market and bugger the lot of them.

You see, when people disagree on virtually everything in life – from the birth of babies to the education and nurturing of children; from politics to paedophilia and marriage to marketing it stops us from uniting.



I read a great quote the other day from Donald Trump which seems to say it all.

This issue of _The Current Wisdom_ is a departure from our usual format, where Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels normally reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
Instead, this Wisdom examines the reaction to a scientific paper, described in last month’s version, showing that recent annual ice melt from Greenland, while certainly elevated, does not appear appreciably different from melt values simulated for the early and mid‐​20th century.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Previous editions of Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty.



To practicing scientists, the most significant revelation in the November 2009 stack of purloined University of East Anglia emails known worldwide now as “Climategate” were the plans to harass editors of refereed scientific journals who accepted papers from the (erroneously labeled) climate “skeptics.” There was also disturbing evidence of collusion between the some of the Climategate principals and more agreeable editors.



See for yourself, as revealed in the emails. Here are a few highlights. The first refers to _Geophysical Research Letters_ (“GRL”), and was sent on January 20, 2005.

Dear All,



Just a heads up. Apparently, the contrarians now have an “in” with GRL. This guy Saiers has a prior connection w/​the University of Virginia Dept.of Environmental Sciences that causes me some unease.



I think we now know how the various Douglass et al papers w/​Michaels and Singer, the Soon et al paper, and now this one have gotten published in GRL,

Mike,



This is truly awful. GRL has gone downhill rapidly in recent years. I think the decline began before Saiers. I have had some unhelpful dealings with him recently with regard to a paper Sarah and I have on glaciers — it was well received by the referees, and so is in the publication pipeline. However, I got the impression that Saiers was trying to keep it from being published.



Proving bad behavior here is very difficult. If you think that Saiers is in the greenhouse skeptics camp, then, if we can find documentary evidence of this, we could go through official AGU channels to get him ousted. Even this would be difficult… 



Tom.



===========================================================



Thanks Tom,



Yeah, basically this is just a heads up to people that something might be up here. What a shame that would be. It’s one thing to lose “Climate Research”. We can’t afford to lose GRL. I think it would be useful if people begin to record their experiences w/​both Saiers and potentially Mackwell (I don’t know him — he would seem to be complicit w/​what is going on here).



If there is a clear body of evidence that something is amiss, it could be taken through the proper channels. I don’t that the entire AGU hierarchy has yet been compromised!

Hi Malcolm,



… I don’t believe a response in GRL is warranted in any case. The MM claims in question are debunked in other papers that are in press and in review elsewhere. I’m not sure that GRL can be seen as an honest broker in these debates anymore, and it is probably best to do an end run around GRL now where possible. They have published far too many deeply flawed contrarian papers in the past year or so. There is no possible excuse for them publishing all 3 Douglass papers and the Soon et al paper. These were all pure crap.



There appears to be a more fundamental problem w/​GRL now, unfortunately…



Mike



[“MM” in this case refers to a paper by Steve McIntyre and Ross McKitrick called “Hockey Sticks, Principal Components, and Spurious Significance”. Michael Mann is the creator of the original “hockey stick” reconstruction of global temperature]



The exchange shows key scientists discussing removing journal editors who allowed papers to be published that disagreed with their findings or methodology. They identify the suspect editors in question and then suggest collecting data on their activities to potentially be used in getting them ousted.



There is also discussion about boycotting (i.e. “do an end run around”) the offending journals. And when all else fails, they attempt to “redefine” what they consider to be the peer‐​reviewed literature.



These shenanigans prompted waves of nausea both within and outside of the climate community. So, has the lesson been learned that maybe it’s not a good idea to go beyond the normal rules of scientific civility and to actually cultivate a bit of climate science diversity?



No. Consider the developments since our last _Current Wisdom_ article, “Please Sell Me Your Beach House.”



I was an author of a recently published a paper in _Journal of Geophysics Research‐​Atmospheres_ , which examined the magnitude current ice melt taking in Greenland compared with a statistical estimate of what has taken place there for the past 225 years. We were able to go back to the late 18th century because of a remarkable record of weather stations established by the Danish colonists.



We concluded that while the melt in recent years was quite high, it probably wasn’t unprecedented. _JGR_ uses a single‐​blind review process—that is, there were three reviewers who were anonymous to us, but they knew who we were. The double‐​blind review processes, while common in other disciplines, and relatively rare in climate science, which is probably one of the systematic problems in the discipline that created an atmosphere primed for Climategate‐​like storms. The fact that editors have not changed this policy in light of the Climategate emails is an ominous portent.



After our paper was published, one of the previously anonymous reviewers revealed himself through a blog entry on his website. This individual was Dr. Jason Box, geography professor at Ohio State University who has done a lot of work on the Greenland ice, and was therefore well‐​qualified to review our work (and in fact, was one of the people that we suggested to _JGR_ as a potential reviewer of our paper). His blog entry was not about how a paper that he recently reviewed perhaps shed some new light on the longer term history of ice melt across Greenland, but instead was highly (to put it mildly) critical of our results as well as the review process at _JGR_ , and for good measure, as if it was somehow relevant to the science in our paper, decided to trot out the old “denialism” war horse and to explain that he, Box, is “inspired by scientific denialism.” 



Here are some excerpts from Box’s blog posts titled “selective science=pseudo science”:



“I was invited by Dr. Guosheng Liu – Associate Editor – Journal of Geophysical Research ( _JGR_ ) – Atmospheres to review the article. Sara Pryor was the _JGR_ chief editor ultimately responsible for this paper’s review.”… [Note to readers: this information is not normally revealed. Doing so is a clear attempt to incite an academic lynch mob.]



“The Editor’s decision whether or not to accept the paper would have been made sometime early 2011. This paper should not have been accepted for publication without taking into account important new data.”… [emphasis in original]



“Unfortunately, the paper represents not only a failure of the review process, but an intentional exclusion of data that would, if included, undermine the paper’s thesis.”… 



“A documented campaign of climate change denialism, of which the authors Frauenfeld, Knappenberger, Michaels are a documented part, seeks to undermine the well‐​established science that demonstrates unequivocally the reality of anthropogenic climate change, characterized by global warming among other changes in the climate system.”… 



[Questions to readers: has the author of _The Current Wisdom_ ever said, for decades, that humans are not changing global surface temperature? Is it not the nature of science to “undermine” what is “well‐​established”?]



“I, Jason E. Box, am a physical climatologist focusing on Greenland ice‐​climate interactions since 1993. My agenda is the philosophy (a.k.a. the search for truth) about Greenland’s climate variations. I am inspired by scientific denialism to counter pseudo‐​science on the important topic of climate change.”



Jason Box is naming the responsible editors at _JGR_ , saying that the peer‐​review process there failed, and then pointing out what evil people the authors are especially when compared to himself. What the latter has to do with the former is unclear, unless he is somehow trying to slip in that Liu and Pryor are potential denialist sympathizers.



So much for the lessons of Climategate.



Judith Curry is the Head of the Earth and Atmospheric Science department at Georgia Tech, who runs a very popular climate science blog. Her take on all of this is very interesting:



Regarding editor Gusheng Liu:



“The editor on this one was Guosheng Liu, my former postdoc and collaborator; a more honest, fair, and conscientious editor would be hard to find.”



On Box’s reaction:



“So, some climate change skeptics actually got a fair shake in the review process by an editor (Guosheng Liu), and a “consensus” reviewer is outraged.”



The “important new data” that Box said we were evading is the 2010 melt data. It is a combination of records from three different sources, which are not even available until late in the following year.



In fact, because this paper was so long in the review process (for reasons that should be obvious), we had to revise it by including 2008 and 2009 data.



We also would like to assure Dr. Box, who surely knows this, that inclusion of 2010 data, which, from preliminary data, appears to be a very high melt year (but not significantly different from other high ones) would in fact have strengthened our results. The more data one has, especially at the extremes, the more robust the subsequent model is.



At any rate Climategate lives on. Now, as then, any editor who dares to publish anything that does not imply the end‐​of‐​the‐​world‐​as‐​we‐​know‐​it‐​pronto risks loss of confidentiality or worse. “You’ve been warned. Back off. Once these people are mad, honest, I can’t control them.”



What an awful profession climate science has become.

For the last few years a number of financial managers have been spending increasing resources to prod the companies they invest in to adopt more environmentally conscious and socially aware policies in their businesses. Many publicly‐​held corporations have had to deal with multiple shareholder resolutions annually intended to force them to adopt more socially or environmentally aware perspectives. Other investment fund managers have begun voting their proxies in favor of such shareholder resolutions, while taking other actions to encourage what they deem to be more socially salutary behavior.   
  
  
However, there is an inherent conflict in such resolutions coming from investors: after all, the inevitable result of a corporation bowing to a proxy vote and prioritizing such activities is that it would reduce its profits–a bad thing for those who hold stock in the company.   
  
  
Not so fast, say the activists driving this movement: while they may be pushing companies to pursue environmentally and socially responsible activities for their own political goals, they aver that such actions actually make good business sense as well, and that these will ultimately increase the profits of these companies. One oft‐​used rationale for resolutions pertinent to climate change is that these actions improve the long run sustainability of the company, which rational shareholders will value and thus will be reflected in the stock price.   
  
  
While the firm‐​as‐​pure‐​profit‐​maximizer may be a perspective that fails to capture the complexity that is today’s multinational corporation, the notion that investor activists are somehow doing shareholders a favor and helping corporations correct a blind spot in their vision is absurd, and earlier this week the Department of Labor finally declared that to be the case.   
  
  
The DOL declared that financial managers can no longer justify pushing environmentally or socially beneficial investments on the grounds that they are inherently beneficial for shareholders. Specifically, it wrote that:   




“fiduciaries may not sacrifice returns or assume greater risks to promote collateral environmental, social, or corporate governance (ESG) policy goals when making investment decisions.”



The Labor Department’s actions effectively make it more difficult for activists to pursue social policy via proxy battles, which is precisely how it should be. Such efforts represent nothing less than an attempt to effectively tax the retirement wealth of savers to advance a political agenda.

"Britain’s homes are responsible for almost a third of the nation’s energy use, despite decades of gradually improving energy efficiency. For the UK to meet its targets for carbon emissions reductions by 2050, around 600,000 homes per year will need to be renovated to generate sufficiently large energy savings.  But at the moment only a few hundred are being renovated to a high energy saving standard each year – many more people will need to be encouraged to take on the job for themselves and bring their homes up to modern standards. Homeowners that have already done so can help make the case for others to follow, being as they are pioneers, and occasionally they open their homes to the public. For example, those homeowners in the Superhome nework, the longest established open home network in the UK, launched by the Sustainable Energy Academy in 2006. Our study published recently in the Buildings Research and Information journal examined the experiences of Superhome owner-occupiers, to discover who they were, their motivations, and the costs and benefits of renovation. We conducted an online survey with 57 Superhome owner-occupiers (about half of all relevant households), and 14 detailed interviews. We found that compared with a typical English owner-occupier, Superhome owners are on average better educated, live in larger household groups and larger homes, and have higher incomes – characteristics that are commonly found in those with pro-environmental values. Perhaps more surprising was the wide range of incomes: while many are better off than average, a significant proportion of Superhome owners live on much lower-than-average incomes. Having money helps, but low energy renovating is not the preserve of the well-off. Of course, one of the benefits of energy efficient homes is that they cost less to run. Households had on average installed ten energy efficiency or renewable energy measures. The most popular were loft insulation (100%), wall insulation (91%), double-glazed or other high-performance windows (81%), and solar panels (77%). All these techniques and technologies that can deliver energy savings and low carbon buildings are well understood, and most households undertook similar work. What this study confirms is that effective low carbon renovation work can be carried out over a long period. Renovation could be completed in less than six months or take several decades, with the most common time period (30% of respondents) being between two and five years. Renovations can also be split into those planned from the start (60%), and those which developed over time (40%). Almost universally, the reasons householders wanted to renovate their homes were to reduce energy use and carbon emissions, with other benefits including better warmth and comfort in the house and reduced energy bills. During the interviews we explored their motivations in more detail: some were driven by environmental concerns, others focused more on reducing waste, others still saw energy reduction as part of process towards a better quality of life. As researchers are beginning to understand, deciding to renovate is not a simple or single issue decision. Superhome owners are often asked about the cost. This can be surprisingly hard to answer, for two reasons. For a start, detailed records may not have been kept. And also distinguishing the additional costs of energy saving measures from the other renovations taking place at the same can be very difficult. For example, many home owners take advantage of trigger points, such as when extending their homes, to introduce low energy measures at the same time. Our interviewees estimated spending between a few thousand into the low tens of thousands of pounds on their renovations. Lower cost renovations usually involved an element of DIY. Most Superhome owners think in terms of whether the work will deliver the benefits they want, and whether it is affordable. One interviewee said: Everyone always asks ‘what’s the payback?’ Actually the most important thing is I now have a house that’s warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and frankly I didn’t have that before because in the winter, all the heating was on maximum and it all went straight out the windows and walls. So now it’s a very nice place to live. None of the Superhome owners funded their renovations purely through loans or mortgages, most used a combination of savings and other finance or paid for them out of income, particularly if carrying out the work over a long period. So what would encourage more people to undertake low carbon renovation? While we have shown that many different combination of planning, financing and timing can be successful, taking action comes down to means, motive and opportunity. People need access to finance, knowledge, and advice, as well as DIY skills or skilled professionals. Low carbon retrofits engage with many important values and aspirations – the renovation must deliver benefits beyond just energy savings. And there must be an understanding of the opportunities to incorporate low-carbon options wherever and whenever possible. Find the sweet spot that provides a means to get this combination right, and we might see more people taking the chance to live in better heated, more comfortable, cheaper, greener homes."
"**When England went into a national lockdown on 5 November, it left behind a three-tiered system of restrictions designed to keep the virus under control.**
Now the system is returning - although with stricter rules and more areas in the toughest, third tier. So has the lockdown worked - and why was it necessary in the first place?
Between 14 October, when the tiers were introduced, and 5 November when they were replaced, cases continued to rise across the country. The weekly number rose in every region - by half in London, more than three-quarters in the East of England and, in the South East and the West Midlands, it more than doubled.
In the North West and North East, though, cases began to level off, rising by only 6% and 10% respectively.
It suggests the highest tier may have had some impact - the North West, where cases rose the least, was largely in tier three. But tier two had little effect in most of the country, while in many tier-one areas - particularly in the South East - cases rose quickly.
The government's independent advisers, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) concluded: ""Tier-one measures alone are not enough to prevent the epidemic from growing rapidly.""
It estimated cases could shrink by a ""modest"" 10% when moving from tier one to tier two.
And even for tier three - as it stood before 5 November (less stringent than it will be from 2 December) - it was ""unclear"" whether those restrictions alone would be enough to cause the epidemic to shrink ""at a regional or national level"".
Case numbers did fall in some areas under the tier system, at a more local level. For example, in Manchester and Liverpool they fell by about a third and a half respectively. Labour and Conservative MPs have criticised the government for not factoring in the differences in rates within regions when assigning tiers - putting the whole of the North East into tier three, for example.
This picture of generally rising cases sets the scene for why the government might have felt a second lockdown was necessary. Beyond the over-arching aim of ensuring that numbers falling ill are as low as possible, case numbers need to be reasonably low for the test-and-trace system to have a shot at controlling the epidemic.
According to Sage: ""Test and trace, including mass testing, is most effective when prevalence is low. Even the most effective test-and-trace system will have little impact when caseloads are high.""
And the lockdown does appear to have turned the tide in most of the country. Cases fell by about a third in the North East and South West, and about a half in the North West and in Yorkshire and the Humber.
But case numbers take much longer to fall than they do to rise. One estimate suggested for every day of cases increasing, it could take five days for them to come back down again.
You can see this in the figures. Whereas some areas' cases more than doubled while the tier system was in place, the most dramatic falls under lockdown were only half that rate over the same period.
In London, the South East and in the East of England, cases remained virtually static - rising at first immediately after lockdown, perhaps because of pre-lockdown socialising, before starting to decline slightly.
But the government has judged that there are now enough cases to return the country to restrictions that, while slightly looser than in the lockdown, are tougher within each tier than they were before it.
Fears of what a lockdown in the run-up to Christmas might do to already-struggling shops and restaurants are likely to have been in the prime minister's mind.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the new tiers have been based on factors that include numbers of positive tests and the pressures on the NHS.
The government is also looking at the numbers involving people aged over 60 and the rate at which cases are rising or falling.
But if you plot every local area on a graph, it's clear the the overall number of cases per 100,000 people is the main deciding factor.
The regions with the highest number of cases are generally in tier three, those in the middle in tier two and those with the lowest number of cases are in tier one.
That's why, for example, the North East is in tier three and London in tier two, even though the region has had a much bigger fall in cases, comparatively, than the capital. The North East still has almost twice the number of cases that London has.
It is thought that there won't be much movement between tiers before Christmas.

For the first time in a few years, I went to a political meeting yesterday morning. The sitting MP had arranged a “SuperBlues” meeting, with Paula Bennett advertised as guest speaker. I thought that I would go and raise my thought that losing freedom of speech is the greatest threat facing us today.



Rather than Paula Bennett, the local MP was supported by Todd Muller. There was no apology from Bennett, nor any explanation on why the change in guest speaker had been made.  
Now Muller is a probably a pleasant enough guy, and it may not be entirely his fault that he is the Nats spokesman on climate change. But that was very much the focus of the meeting. 



Muller is obviously a climate change disciple. He said words to the effect that it is real and had to be dealt with. And that rather than turning their backs on the issue, **the Nats had to get in bed with the international community, and the government,** and come up with an agreed combined strategy. He didn’t say that there was an emergency, but he made it quite clear that in his mind **the science was settled.**



After his address they did allow a few questions from the floor; these were all around this topic. After perhaps half a dozen questions the meeting was drawn to close.  
I did not get to make my point re freedom of speech, nor ask what they thought of the recent Australian election when a lot of the climate change matters were rejected by their electorate.



We were invited to stay and chat with both the local MP and Muller, but I figured that I had already lost 90 minutes or so of my life that I was never going to get back.  
I have the feeling that I am not walking away from the National Party; rather the National Party is walking away from me. Or perhaps I should say they are running away from me.

"Are you feeling inspired from watching the Chelsea Flower Show? Do you long for an immaculate, well-designed garden, full of well-behaved plants, brimming with colourful flowers and attractive foliage? The problem is that the gardens and flowers on show at Chelsea require a great deal of maintenance, a regular application of fertilisers and liberal use of herbicides and pesticides to keep hungry bugs and weeds at bay.  But there is an alternative option. If you want a low-maintenance, natural ecosystem, then look no further for cultivating a garden that’s good for you and your family. Growing a wild flower meadow in your garden is one option for keeping things really natural and low maintenance, but still very beautiful. Planting perennial wild flowers will bring year-on-year returns. Beware though, they prefer to grow on poorer soils just because this reduces grass growth, which otherwise tends to out-compete the flowers. You can of course reduce your soil nutrition by removing the top soil first before planting, but another option is to grow wildflower annuals which can be planted into richer soil. It is best to avoid collecting seeds from plants growing in the wild as this can seriously deplete the natural seed bank. Since the 1930s the prevalence of wild flower meadows has diminished alarmingly down to only 2% of their former levels. Instead it is recommended that you find a good wild flower seed supplier who can advise you on the best seed mix for the conditions in your area. Native species will better self-seed and support the regeneration of wild flowers. Sometimes we don’t get along with our neighbours and long to move to an environment where we can happily abide in peace. Well there’s evidence to show that some plants may feel the same, as there are species that send out toxic chemicals which inhibit the development of surrounding plants, a process called allelopathy.  Black walnut trees, for example, do this by producing their own chemical herbicide, juglone. It is excreted from the tree’s roots into the surrounding soil, which can then cause wilting and yellowing of nearby plant leaves and may even eventually kill its neighbours. Certain species such as cabbages, tomatoes, potatoes and apple and yew trees are particularly sensitive to juglone, which means you should avoid planting them near black walnut trees.  But some plant species seem to actually encourage the growth of other plants. Pea family plants, for example, improve the soil around them through the rhizobium bacteria they have in their roots. This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into an absorbable form, benefiting the growth of surrounding plants.  Some plants can also be beneficial to neighbouring plants by repelling harmful insects. For example, when you plant onions with carrots, this inhibits carrot flies; or plant french beans with cabbages, the beans deter aphids. Cultivating these plants is known as companion planting and if you want your garden to flourish, neighbourly plants are the ones you want to go for. Scientists have also been exploring signals given off by plants, with research demonstrating that certain species, when attacked by pests, produce odours to repel them or attract other insects that naturally deter their pests. The cabbage family of plants frequently produce a pungent mustard-smelling chemical called isothiocyanate, which repels certain types of aphid. Some plants also release an aromatic chemical called myrtenal that has a similar insect-repelling function. Myrtenal smells a bit like pine trees, but is found in aromatic plants such as thyme, mint, rosemary and sage. By growing these herbs in your garden, besides providing you with excellent ingredients for the kitchen, you’ll have natural pest inhibitors. Wildflowers are also useful for their role as pollinator plants as they help to support declining bee populations. Many cultivated plant varieties have defective pollen and nectar producing organs and may have multiple petals that block pollinator entry, which is bad for the ecosystem. Don’t think of bees as pests in your garden, rather sit back and watch these pollinators at work. You’ll observe some fascinating behaviour in the way they stimulate the pollen chambers of difference flowers to enhance pollen release – a process called buzz pollination or sonication.  It is a process young bees and bumblebees have to learn, as they need to clasp the pollen organs and then rapidly move their wing muscles to produce a vibration that is significantly higher and louder in frequency than that used for flight. When the right vibration is created this stimulates the release of pollen. Certain flowering species are particular geared for buzz pollination, such as potato and tomato flowers. Cultivating a natural garden is not only good for the environment, but a relaxed and low-maintenance way of gardening. Plus, as it grows and develops day-by-day, you will have more time to sit and enjoy watching and learning from the fascinating workings of nature around you."

Mike Mann thinks this is cool.

In case you don’t know, SUNY’s Professor Scott Mandia is the guy running Mike Mann’s legal defense fund.
My only question is, why does he need hip wader boots?


From Scott Mandia’s blog he captions this photo: The Caped Climate Crusader: Battling the evil forces of global warming deniers. “Faster than global T rise, more powerful than a stranded polar bear, able to leap over rising seas in a single bound.”
If he can leap over rising seas, why the hip waders? Must be for wading through something deep, but what could it be?
I’m sure our readers can help correct this caption.

Continued Bias Reporting On The Climate System By Tom Karl and Peter Thorne
By Dr. Roger Pielke Sr.
Today, there were news articles concerning the state of the climate system; e.g. see  the Associated Press news release in the Washington Post
Climate change study: More than 300 months since the planets temperature was below average
The news article refers to the 2010 climate summary that will be published in a Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society article. The article will undoubtedly include informative information on the climate.
However, the news article itself erroneously reports on the actual state of the climate, as can easily be shown simply by extracting current analyses from the web.  Two of the prominent individuals quoted in the news report are Tom Karl and Peter Thorne. They make the following claims

“The indicators show unequivocally that the world continues to warm,” Thomas R. Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center, said in releasing the annual State of the Climate report for 2010.”
“There is a clear and unmistakable signal from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans,” added Peter Thorne of the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites, North Carolina State University.”
“Carbon dioxide increased by 2.60 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2010, which is more than the average annual increase seen from 1980-2010, Karl added. Carbon dioxide is the major greenhouse gas accumulating in the air that atmospheric scientists blame for warming the climate.”
Karl is correct on the increase in carbon dioxide, but, otherwise,  he and Peter Thorne are not honestly presenting  the actual state of the climate system.  They focus on the surface temperature data, which as, we have reported on in peer-reviewed papers, has major unresolved uncertainties and includes a systematic warm bias; e.g. see
Pielke Sr., R.A., C. Davey, D. Niyogi, S. Fall, J. Steinweg-Woods, K. Hubbard, X. Lin, M. Cai, Y.-K. Lim, H. Li, J. Nielsen-Gammon, K. Gallo, R. Hale, R. Mahmood, S. Foster, R.T. McNider, and P. Blanken, 2007: Unresolved issues with the assessment of multi-decadal global land surface temperature trends. J. Geophys. Res., 112, D24S08, doi:10.1029/2006JD008229.
Klotzbach, P.J., R.A. Pielke Sr., R.A. Pielke Jr., J.R. Christy, and R.T. McNider, 2009: An alternative explanation for differential temperature trends at the surface and in the lower troposphere. J. Geophys. Res., 114, D21102, doi:10.1029/2009JD011841.
The climate system has not warmed since about 2003 either in the upper ocean or in the lower troposphere as shown in the three figures below.
Tom Karl is wrong in his first quote  – The indicators DO NOT show unequivocally that the world continues to warm. This warming has stalled, at least for now, since about 2003. Peter Thorne is misrepresenting the actual data when he erroneously reports that (assuming he means ‘unequivocal warming’)  “There is a clear and unmistakable signal from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans”.

Second, the lower troposphere (from both the RSS and UAH MSU data)  also do NOT SHOW unequivocally that the world continues to warm! Indeed, warming has also stalled since about 2002.

Figure caption: Global  average (70 south to 82.5 north) lower tropospheric temperatures (from RSS)

Figure caption: Global  average (70 south to 82.5 north) lower tropospheric temperatures (from UAH)
It should not be surprising that Tom Karl and Peter Thorne are not honestly reporting the actual state of the climate system, which involves a much more complex signal in response to human and natural climate forcings and feedbacks, than they report on; e.g. see
Christy, J.R., B. Herman, R. Pielke, Sr., P. Klotzbach, R.T. McNider, J.J. Hnilo, R.W. Spencer, T. Chase and D. Douglass, 2010: What do observational datasets say about modeled tropospheric temperature trends since 1979?  Remote Sensing, 2(9), 2148-2169.
Previous documentation of the biases and efforts to manage the information provided to policymakers by Tom Karl and Peter Thorne includes the following examples
Pielke Sr., Roger A., 2005: Public Comment on CCSP Report “Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere: Steps for Understanding and Reconciling Differences“. 88 pp including appendices
The Selective Bias Of NOAA’s National Climate Data Center (NCDC) With Respect To The Analysis And Interpretation Of Multi-Decadal Land Surface Temperature Trends Under The Leadership Of Tom Karl and Tom Peterson
Erroneous Climate Science Statement By Tom Karl, Director Of The National Climate Data Center And President Of The American Meteorological Society
E-mail Documentation Of The Successful Attempt By Thomas Karl Director Of the U.S. National Climate Data Center To Suppress Biases and Uncertainties In the Assessment Of Surface Temperature Trends
Erroneous Statement By Peter A. Stott And Peter W. Thorne In Nature Titled “How Best To Log Local Temperatures?”
It is disappointing that the media do not properly question the claims made by Tom Karl and Peter Thorne. They are presenting a biased report on the actual state of the climate system.

Possibly many Oilers shared my opinion that Todd Muller, MP for Western Bay of Plenty and National Party Climate Change spokesman, was attempting to steer a balanced course and soften the excesses of James Shaw et al. He appeared, in speeches in the house, to be agreeing with cuts while warning against getting ahead of the rest of the world with excessive cuts and aggressive pain to the economy. 



Wonder no more. Todd is swimming in the Koolaid while singing “ _I’m a Believer_ “.



I have always had a lot of respect for Todd, my local MP, as a person. He is a thoroughly nice bloke and a great electorate MP. However his latest utterance has blown it.



 **Wibble** was out of the blocks smartly with a comment about a ‘consensus’ that Todd and National might not find quite as acceptable:



Dear Todd, thanks for confirming that you do not believe in science in any way, shape or form, and that you instead believe that decisions should be made based upon subjective opinions and political “consensus” rather than objective fact. There is no such thing as “consensus” in science Todd, and anyone who says that there is, has just proven that they are not, by definition, a scientist. Perhaps you have read a little too much from the great “Scientists” like Al Gore, Barack Obama and Greta Thunberg.



Since you seem to be so happy with the “consensus” that you already have on climate change Todd, then you will be glad to know that traditional National Party voters will not be so cruel as to overburden you with yet another “consensus” of votes in the upcoming election. Clearly one consensus is already beyond your understanding. As a past National Party voter, Au Revoir Todd.



 **Cadae** suggested Todd really read the IPCC reports, not just the soundbites for politicans.



Todd needs to read the real science sections of the IPCC AR reports – not the bureaucracy-created and politically driven summaries that have misled him. In the science sections he will find plenty of hedging statements about the soundness of the models and their future ‘projections’. Note especially the clearly documented lack of understanding of the impact of and the ability to model clouds. Clouds have a significant impact on temperatures and precipitation.



**Blueburd** challenged Todd to prove it to us all:



Hey Todd, show us the absolute proof that MMCC is real and happening. To date every prediction made about CC let alone MMCC has been wrong. The polar caps are still in place, there is still sea ice and snow continues to fall. All of those were predicted to not exist anymore.



I suggest you join the real world, and realise that looking after our environment and reducing pollution in our own neck of the woods will be far more beneficial than giving $1.4b a year to an unknown entity



 **Doug Longmire** was another one not buying ‘consensus:



Science is research, data, double blind studies, evidence, critical evaluation of an hypothesis.   
Science is NOT “consensus” . Politics is consensus.  
Every medical or science student knows this.  
The Global man made global warming rort fails all of these simple, High School, basic scientific tests.



 **Yawgdum Nomad** didn’t hold back!



Todd Muller. Seriously. Are you mentally challenged? I will tell you what fellow oilers, I’m finding it very hard as an independent thinker to not completely lose it with these fools. If Todd really has fallen for the biggest scam in human history, then he’s about as much use as a two day old ham sandwich.



And another affirmation that the Nats are as relevant to right minded folk as Cuba’s communistic regime.



 **Noncommittal** , **Bartman** , **LaidbackSally** , **PaulC** , **STAG** , **GT** , **Cedric** , **Wibble** and yours truly all declared that this was the final straw and that National had lost their votes.



 **SadButTru** e had an idea to get us out of the mess:



Boris, please annex NZ. We haven’t got anyone here with a clue

Presumably when your business model depends upon people being stupid enough to think that they can beat the house at a gambling table or pokie machine then anything goes.



SkyCity hotels are introducing a different kind of bible to its rooms – a book on climate change.



The revelation was announced at a Climate Leaders Coalition meeting last night, when SkyCity chief executive Graeme Stephens said they were adding a new Gideons Bible to their rooms.



When asked about it on stage, Stephens said: “I hope I’m not being offensive. But I’m introducing a new Gideons Bible to our hotel rooms in the form of books on climate change.”



He said he had asked Meridian head Neal Barclay for advice about it.



“I said to him: ‘I want a book that I can understand, that actually points to what I can do today, not some sort of **nebula** [sic] scientific concept’.”



The practice of keeping a Bible in hotel rooms started in the late 19th century when three men who founded Gideons International in the 1800s spread the good news by distributing Bibles in hotel rooms.



Stephens received the climate change book – Drawdown – the next day.



 **“It’s a great book because it’s got lots of pictures.** […]



  
Really? So did my earliest childhood books!



I wonder what the Gideons organisation feels about this book being called a “new Gideons Bible”?



And what is a ‘nebula’? Let’s ask NASA:



A **nebula** is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form.



  
It would appear that SkyCity chief executive Graeme Stephens skipped science lessons. Presumably, that is why a nonsense book with lots of pictures appeals.



Let’s read a few reviews of _Drawdown_ from Amazon. 



The author knew darn well that the topic is of great importance, so he set out to write 3 page excepts on 90 shallow ideas. i tried to finish the book, but **it was too stupid, too shallow and too amateurish** to waste my time getting to the end. I quit about 70% of the way through, and I almost never quit a book….. **complete trash, not helpful** , the author took advantage of the fact so many people are eager to learn the truth about renewable energy possibilities and **he managed to publish nonsense**.



  
Many chapters give estimates of dollar and carbon savings for different climate interventions. **I could not find any methodology for the calculations or references to them.** Though this book many describe all the topics under the umbrella of climate change, those looking for references to original sources will encounter problems.



  
I bought this book with a genuine interest in the different proposals on how to tackle global warming, and after reading about half of it I gave it up. **This is more left wing propaganda than it is an objective view on climate and potential solutions.** […]



  
Clearly I have picked these reviews as there was glowing support from the believers, however, even the top positive review was still critical.



Drawdown is long overdue. As with all of Hawken’s writings it’s well conceived, carefully researched and beautifully written. Thank goodness for this effort. Yet….



 **I looked in vain for the evidence** that the remedies discussed will materially change the trajectory of projected temperature increases. How much below 2 C will we stabilize at with full implementation of these 100 remedies? According to the book even the most aggressive scenario they model only reduces CO2 by less than one gigaton (out of about 40 gigatons we spew each year) and that isn’t until 2045. That means that we’re still doomed.



  
Perhaps a handbook on dealing with problem gambling would be of more use to the guests and society in general than this new “Bible”?

"Bumblebees are among the intellectual giants of the insect world. They learn the locations of landmarks relative to their nest, and are able to navigate accurately many miles across the landscape. They quickly learn which flowers are the most rewarding, and how best to collect the rewards swiftly, using the least energy. They even use the faint smell of previous bee visitors to tell them which flowers are likely to have been emptied, and avoid them in favour of those with a full tank.  Bumblebees communicate through pheromones, which the queen uses to communicate within the nest, and through sounds caused by their wings, which workers can use to recruit more foragers and to signal danger. They can even learn by watching each other which flowers are the most rewarding. They are amazing and important creatures, for they pollinate numerous wildflowers and many crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, raspberries and runner beans. "

Ever since the selection of the CoL, New Zealand’s population has suffered a blitzkrieg of the IPCC climate change farce. There is absolutely no scientific proof of this anthropogenic global warming alarmist hypothesis that calls for a “Climate Emergency”, yet we are told again and again: “the debate is over” and “the science is settled”. Because we are not allowed further debate, it means that in this case **‘science’ has become ideology.**



Prior to our Little Ice Age during the Medieval Warm Period, Vikings colonised Greenland and Newfoundland, when it was warmer than it is today. It was also warmer during Roman times, long before fossil fuels revolutionised civilisation.



We are continually told that CO2 is a “toxic pollutant” that must be curtailed **when in fact it is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas,** present at 400 parts per million of the global atmosphere, and is the most important food for life on earth. Without CO2 above 150 parts per million, all plants would die and so would most animals on earth, including humans. 



At 400 parts per million our food crops, forests, and natural ecosystems are apparently still on a starvation diet for CO2. One wing of the scientific community promotes the IPCC “Climate Change CO2 warming” danger line. Other scientists and researchers promote the positive impact of the small increase in CO2 over the past 50 years, because apparently increased CO2 means that plants don’t need as much water, so our deserts can become lusher. 



I am not a scientist however, that sounds pretty darn good to me as we, by our very existence, have absolute and historically validated proof that CO2 is vital for life on earth and plants need CO2 for photosynthesis. Despite this we still have the doomsayers using the climate to justify a **‘war’** on CO2: to instil fear, increase taxes and control our everyday lives. 



The Greens have labelled ‘weather’ or ‘climate change’ our enemy. What a terrible, fictitious burden to indoctrinate our children with.



I say that remaining alive on the earth would be a lot more difficult without CO2, and having a little more of it could be very positive in helping us to feed the world and enhance the planet’s green ecology. 



The NZ parliament and most local councils are threatening to hobble our economy with a ‘climate emergency’. Why is this happening when much larger ­nations take a ‘pass’ by making pious pronouncements and then doing absolutely nothing?



 **When will the New Zealand people wake up and take notice**? The seriousness of needing more CO2, was most evident when **the lack of CO 2 in Europe, due to the shutdown of ammonia plants, contributed to the beer shortage** **for the 2018 European world cup celebrations**. 



Will the natural fermentation process that allows CO2 production also be taxed or perhaps even banned? Do we need to immediately call ‘ **a beer shortage emergency’?**



My ‘beer in jest analogy’ relates to the USA alcohol prohibition in the 1920s and early 30s, to exemplify how activists and politicians shifted the Overton window enough that the banning of alcohol was ‘acceptable’ to the general public. In actuality, it later turned out that very few of the public wanted their alcoholic tipple taken away. 



Today, similarly, the politicians are wanting to move the Overton window, by hysterically calling the AGW scam a **‘CRISIS’**. This enables the politicians to gain more power and garner extra tax, thereby eroding taxpayers’ rights and pushing more ‘deplorables’ into dependency on the state. 



Let’s adjust that window back to include democratic common sense.

WUWT readers may remember this story I wrote about the clowns from Old Pulteney’s “Row to the Pole” who had headlines blaring in Britain exclaiming they had rowed to the “north pole”. Telegraph, BBC, and Independent geography FAIL: “Row to the Pole” never made it to the “North Pole” – they are 790 miles short

I pointed out that not only were they NOT at the north pole, they weren’t even at the north magnetic pole which had since moved due to the Earth’s normal processes.
As I explained before the trip even started, there’s no “pole” achievement here, not even close. They are 738 KM short of the actual magnetic pole. The 1996 magnetic pole doesn’t exist there anymore and thus can’t be a pole of any kind. 

The Telegraph article says:
The successful trip to the Pole, described as the “greatest ocean rows of all time”, was only possible because of more seasonal ice-melt in the Arctic that has opened the waters up.
No mention of the fact that they aren’t even close. The actual North pole is 790 miles away:

Most any child in primary school taking an introduction to geography could spot this error, which makes the Telegraphs error doubly embarrassing.
Following my lead, WUWT reader Neil Turner issued a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) in the UK over this glaring inaccuracy. They responded with a ruling and agreed the Telegraph erred. Here is part of the email exchange from the PCC and the Telegraph:

And here is the microscopically sized “correction” printed today on page 18, next to the nude wrestler story and the fashion news. It doesn’t even contain the word “correction”.

Neil writes in his email to me:
My observation is that it is typical that the misleading story received far greater prominence than the correction. I took this up with the PCC, and they explained that the size, font etc of correction is leaft at the Editor’s discretion.
From my perspective, the editor’s discretion, shown above in it’s placement and size, is pretty much the journalistic equivalent of “eff you!”.
What a bunch of gormless cobblers.
Meanwhile Jock Wishart and the crew enjoys the spoils of their sponsor, the Old Pulteney whisky company, caring not at all that people think he’s reached some sort of geographic pole. Such is the way of the world today, fluff and failure make headlines whiles facts get buried on page 18 next to the nude wrestlers.

"**England's new Covid tier system has a ""sunset"" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion.**
The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it.
MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance.
In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February.
And writing separately in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a ""real chance to return to something like life as normal"".
He warned, however, there would be ""disastrous consequences"" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends.
England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end.
In his letter, Mr Johnson said:
In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines.
He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight.
""We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus.""
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach ""allows us to have these localised restrictions"".
He said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right.""
Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks.
""But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them,"" he said.
Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was ""not unconditional"" and they ""will act in the public interest"".
""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it.""
She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England.
That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him.
So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt.
In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January.
If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February.
He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before Christmas
But one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over.
He said: ""We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid.""
It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely.
Writing in the Sunday Times, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday.
He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier.
""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said.
Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on.
He tweeted that MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time.""
But writing in the Sunday Times, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone.""
She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"".
On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.
Meanwhile, the government has secured a further two million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from US firm Moderna, which has shown to be 95% effective in trials.
This brings the UK's Moderna order to seven million - enough for around 3.5 million people.
Separately, the UK has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, and 40 million doses of the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech, which has also been shown to be 95% effective."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s rosy vision of electric car mobility, like windmills and solar energy, may have once looked good on paper, but it sure is now taking a licking from reality.

“In the process of dying off,” says a German auto expert from the University of Duisburg-Essen. Photo credit:  Michael Movchin, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Now the vision is being carried away to the graveyard in a pine box. The greenie Süddeutsche Zeitung (South German Newspaper) reports on the imminent demise of the electric car. H/t: Benny Peiser. The Süddeutsche Zeitung writes:
So far it hasn’t worked out. The electric auto, which just a few years ago was idolized as a ‘technological revolution for transportation’, just isn’t taking off. The E-Auto project is in the process of dying”, laments Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, auto expert at the University of Duisburg-Essen. […] The pioneers, no question about it, are disappointed.”
And:
On paper the revolution is already rolling. But not on the street. To the contrary: some pilot projects are quietly disappearing.”

Not long ago proponents were pitching the vision of electric cars moving almost silently in the city, producing no smog, accompanied by an extensive network of convenient charging points located at every parking lot and at home…”park and charge” everywhere. Most of the electricity of course would come from wind and sun, and the planet would be saved. And no more extreme weather.
German environmentalists, saw it as an opportunity for Germany to show the world how it’s done and thus got the government to invest massively in the electric car infrastructure.
Today, the whole project appears to be in ruins. Powering electric cars, after all, would have required a far greater supply of electricity. But instead of assuring more production of CO2-free electricity, Germany shot the electric mobility project in the heart when it shut down 8 of its 17 nuclear power plants two years ago. Now the country finds itself importing electricity.
Without the plentiful supply of cheap electricity that nuclear reactors provide, there is no chance of electric car success. At the moment Germany is struggling to supply the basic needs of the country, let alone the power that another 50 million cars would need!
Another obstacle for energy for the electric car is that solar energy and wind energy are nowhere near fulfilling expectations. The industry as a whole has been plagued by bankruptcies. Subsidies are now being cranked back.
Other obstacles of course are the high price of electric cars and their lousy range. Who’s ready to pay $40,000 for what is basically a golf cart and peters out after 100 km?
Electric cars probably could work for many in Germany, if there was a cheap, plentiful and steady supply of electricity. But as long a the country remains stubbornly opposed to nuclear power, then forget about powering cars with electricity.

"**Mass coronavirus testing will be rolled out in a second location in the south Wales valleys.**
People living or working in the lower Cynon valley, which includes Abercynon, Penrhiwceiber and parts of Mountain Ash and Aberaman will be offered tests.
The testing will begin on 5 December and continue until 20 December, the Welsh Government said.
It follows a pilot in Merthyr Tydfil which saw almost 1,000 people tested on its opening day.
Those living in Mountain Ash East and West and Aberaman South will also be eligible for testing.
The mass testing sites in Merthyr opened last weekend and will run until 11 December - about 8,000 people were tested in the first six days there, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said.
The Cynon valley is part of Rhondda Cynon Taf, where the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 people measured at 252.4 over the most recent seven day period.
The two main test centres will be the Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls Centre in Mountain Ash and the Abercynon Sports Centre, although more sites will be announced in the coming days.
People without symptoms will be tested at the sites, with results being issued within 20 to 30 minutes.
Anyone who tests positive will be told to go home and self-isolate immediately.
Mr Gething said: ""As the Merthyr Tydfil pilot has shown, mass testing is providing us with a greater understanding of prevalence within the community and how many people have coronavirus.
""It's also identifying how many people within the community are asymptomatic. Coronavirus has not gone away and we all need to work together to tackle this deadly virus.
""I want to thank everyone in Merthyr Tydfil who have made the pilot project a success and I would encourage the people of lower Cynon valley to get tested.""
Andrew Morgan, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, said: ""This is an integral part of our fight against the virus, as it gives us a greater understanding of the prevalence and level of transmission within our communities.
""Following the positive progress seen in the downward trajectory of daily cases and the positivity rate after both the local measures and the national firebreak lockdown, it is now important that we identify and isolate those who are asymptomatic within our communities to break those chains of transmission as cases are now starting to rise again.""
Speaking to Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales, Labour member of the Senedd for Cynon Valley, Vikki Howells, said: ""Those are the areas where we have seen the highest rates of coronavirus in the last few months so it's very important to focus on those.
""Just yesterday I was in Abercynon and the vicar told me there that he's averaging three coronavirus-related funerals a week. Facts like that really bring it home.
""I would say do the right thing for the sake of the community, we look at Merthyr, the tests seem to be going very well there."""

Saudi Arabia’s prodigal son returns to Washington this week, beginning a tour through the United States apparently aimed at drumming up investment in the country. Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) is young with big ideas: he wants to reform Saudi society and wean the Saudi economy off oil. He also wants to build up Saudi as a foreign policy player – with or without the United States – and cement Saudi dominance in the Gulf.   
  
It’s small wonder then that profiles and articles about the prince typically either laud him as a great reformer or simply criticize his foreign policy blunders. The truth is an accurate portrayal of Mohammed bin Salman must include both. And policymakers and businesses should be wary of the potential pitfalls of his proposed reforms, even as they hope for their success.   
  
The Crown Prince’s social reforms are a welcome step in the right direction, though they will be difficult to complete. Thus far, there has been a crackdown on the religious police, robbing them of much of their power over morality issues. Cinemas have been permitted to screen movies for the first time in decades. Women can now attend sporting events, and legal changes are in progress that will allow them to drive.   
  
Likewise, the innovative economic reforms that MBS has proposed – notably using an IPO of Aramco stock to shift the government’s primary income source away from oil and towards investment gains, paired with an attempt to reform the domestic economy and attract inward investment – could potentially reshape and improve the state of the Saudi economy.   
  
There is no doubt that U.S. policymakers should welcome these changes and encourage Saudi Arabia to continue down this path.   
  
Unfortunately, on the flip side, the assertiveness shown by MBS at home has been matched by an extremely bellicose foreign policy. The young prince’s foreign policy overreach has already helped to create the world’s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The Saudi blockade of Qatar has been spectacularly ineffectual and has hardened into stalemate. 



Worse, both incidents reflect the prince’s worst quality: his hardline stance on Iran and his willingness to see Iranian tentacles behind every crisis, no matter how unrealistic this view is. In his interview on CBS’ 60 Minutes, for example, he blames Shi’ite Iran for the rise of Al Qaeda and other Sunni militant groups and for the civil war in Yemen. His fixation on Iran risks destabilizing the Middle East still further.   
  
Nor are the bad parts of MBS’ record limited to foreign policy. He has cracked down heavily on corruption inside Saudi Arabia, a seemingly praiseworthy campaign that in reality saw him imprison other prominent royals and businessmen in the Ritz Carlton hotel until they agreed to sign over many of their assets to the state. And the prince has ruthlessly centralized power into his own hands, shifting Saudi Arabia from a relatively consensual system of government within the royal family, to a system of one-man rule closer to that of Egypt or Syria.   
  
Policymakers – and indeed, businesses and potential investors – should also be wary of the flaws and potential problems in MBS’ ambitious reform plans. Reform is a slow process, and thus far, there have been no moves to fix some of the worst injustices in the Saudi system, notably the guardianship system for women and ongoing repression of Saudi Shi’ites.   
  
Economic reform is certainly not guaranteed to work either; as with many other oil-rich states, Saudi Arabia will find it brutally hard to wean itself off of oil. Some of the biggest developments in the reform plan thus far are fantastical. The proposed high technology city of Neom sounds impressive till one questions why tech companies would choose to relocate to somewhere with Saudi Arabia’s poor climate, workforce, legal and regulatory systems.   
  
Meanwhile, the much-touted IPO of Aramco will only be able to happen on Western exchanges if substantial changes are made to Aramco’s record-keeping, transparency and perhaps even ownership structure.   
  
And none of this is to mention the issue that combines business and national security concerns in one tight package: civilian nuclear power. Though MBS is seeking U.S. cooperation in building civilian nuclear plants ostensibly to reduce Saudi dependence on domestic oil production, he is also open about the fact that he sees civilian nuclear energy and enrichment capabilities as a potential path to a Saudi nuclear weapon.   
  
For all these reasons, policymakers and investors should be wary of profiles which portray Mohammed bin Salman as either a great reformer, or a callow youth. His proposed reforms for Saudi society are in many ways far-sighted; they carry the potential to fix many of the country’s underlying structural and social problems and should be encouraged.   
  
But at the same time, we can’t overlook his many mistakes and poor choices in domestic and foreign policy, nor ignore the risks inherent in his ongoing reform plans. Being an apparently genuine reformer doesn’t absolve MBS of his aggressive foreign policy steps or domestic authoritarian tendencies.   
  
A complete picture of the young prince’s record suggests caution on the part of investors – and pushback on foreign policy and domestic crackdowns by policymakers – remains by far the best choice.

"**When the prime minister addressed the nation on Thursday following the announcement of England's latest tier restrictions, he reserved much praise for one city in particular.**
Despite recording the third highest coronavirus spike in Europe just six weeks ago, Liverpool's restrictions have been downgraded.
Boris Johnson described it as ""a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate"", so how exactly did they do it?
On a clear night in late July, Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy, the club's first top flight success in 30 years. The spring wave of Covid-19 cases was largely over and life was beginning to get back on track. But local health experts were concerned.
""I think it's fair to say that we were always worried in Liverpool,"" says Louise Kenny, executive pro-vice chancellor at the University of Liverpool's health and life sciences department.
""I think those of us who were well-sighted on the amount of community transmission were always worried that we would have a bad second wave because we never got down to the exceptionally low levels that were seen elsewhere in the country.""
As schools reopened, pubs got busier and the prime minister encouraged workers back to the office, cases in Liverpool started to rise once more.
Before long, a slow trickle became a rapid spike, with 635 cases per 100,000 recorded in the city region on 12 October. Despite some very public warnings, Joe Anderson says he wasn't able to speak directly to the government until shortly before that peak.
Downing Street had been formulating a three-tier system and he was invited to join a video call with Mr Johnson's senior adviser Lord Lister and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.
During long, sometimes tense, meetings over three consecutive days, the three men and officials on either side thrashed out the details of a plan.
They all agreed that Liverpool should enter the highest tier, but arguments focused on a financial relief package.
On the third evening, an agreement had been all but reached. But with the finer points still to be signed off and Liverpool's MPs not yet officially in the loop, details of the negotiations leaked.
""We found out from the news,"" says one Liverpool MP.
""The government didn't talk to local MPs at all, it was pretty disgraceful.""
Like most of the UK, Liverpool was still reeling from the financial effects of the spring lockdown and some worried that further restrictions would only make the situation worse.
At the Micah Liverpool food bank, executive director Paul O'Brien says he and other volunteers noticed a change.
""You can see it sort of physically when people walk up to the food bank. I think once you've been doing these things for a couple of years, myself and the volunteers are able to say 'oh, they're coming to the food bank'.
""Then all of a sudden those people who you think are just walking past are coming in and you think 'oh, they're using the food bank as well'.
""These are people who've only just come out of work or not long come out of work, have used up all their savings and now they've been forced into a position where they've had to use a food bank.""
Several business owners phoned Mr Anderson in tears over the measures, but the mayor was determined that lives should come first.
That position became all too close to home when on 16 October, just two days after Liverpool officially entered tier three, the mayor's brother, Bill, passed away.
""Bill was in the intensive care unit in the Royal Liverpool Hospital,"" says Mr Anderson.
""He was taken in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. At quarter to 10 that evening he lost the battle.
""I'm absolutely clear that if lockdown would have happened in September, then Bill I believe would be alive today, but so would many other thousands of people.""
For some time, the government had been considering piloting a system of mass testing. During that initial wrangling with Lord Lister, Mr Anderson sniffed an opportunity.
""I said to Ed Lister, it's not just about money, we need some physical resources, so what about using the armed forces to help us manage and do some of things around testing and his jaw dropped a little bit.""
Several days later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who knew Mr Anderson from his days as Theresa May's culture secretary, called up the mayor of Liverpool to ask if he'd be interested in hosting the pilot.
The conversation didn't last long.
""I grabbed it with both hands,"" says the mayor, ""because I knew it was going to help us.""
Liverpool has a long history of public health interventions, including a period of mass testing for TB in 1959. That local expertise was soon drawn upon.
""We were offered the chance to work with the Department of Health and Social Care,"" says the University of Liverpool's Louise Kenny, ""and our military colleagues who very kindly came to the city to provide logistics and support for the rollout.""
""But we've had a pretty free rein really in the ongoing design of how best to use that capacity for serial testing and what the university brings is the ability to analyse this pilot and provide that data to inform next steps, both locally and hopefully nationally,"" she adds.
Since mass testing began in early November, research has shown that take-up in the city's most deprived areas has been low and Paul O'Brien says many of the people he meets at the food bank have concerns about both testing and vaccines.
""Exactly what's happened with the testing seems to have happened with the vaccine and I do think it will be something that people get behind eventually, but we just need more information.
""There's so much, sort of, ambiguity about where it's going to be rolled out, when it's going to be rolled out, who are the target groups it's going to be rolled out to.
""There's just so many unanswered questions aren't there?""
Since mass testing began in Liverpool, the number of cases there has fallen rapidly.
After Thursday's announcement that Liverpool will be downgraded to tier two, Joe Anderson has pointed to the wider city's efforts.
Some in government have heaped praise on Liverpool's leaders, suggesting that the key factor was the speed with which they agreed to the original tier three restrictions in October, in contrast they say with areas like Greater Manchester.
But that's not a comparison that sits favourably with the mayor.
""I think it's outrageous to be frank. We're not a poodle, we're not a lapdog. I resent and reject any claims of compliance.
""I wish they would say it to my face, because I've got a pair of boxing gloves downstairs, I'd smack them right in the gob."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate catastrophe-obsessed blogsite klimaretter.com here has a 2-part story on a recent alarmist panel discussion held in Berlin and sponsored by Germany’s version of the Guardian, the TAZ. The panel discussion was dubbed: “The climate conference circus!  Just how stupid is it?” The motto of the 2-hour discussion: “It can’t keep on like this!”
Photo right: Oliver Geden
A better title may have been: Is it better to keep pretending? That’s the question the discussion panel addressed – for real!
Part 1 here, Part 2 here.
The main speakers were the constantly climate-petrified Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute (PIK), and green thinker Oliver Geden (photo above right) of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
The two experts are not at all happy that their beloved green movement is horribly bogged down in an endless swamp with no hope of ever getting out. Geden unloaded over the crumbling green movement and especially the 2°C target: “a placebo designed to pacify society“, an instrument that allows people “to act like they are doing something when in fact they are not.” He called the 2°C target “nothing but talk“. Geden has had enough and is now calling on the warmists to wake up and face the truth: “The 2°C target is hopeless.”
Recall that for German warmists the “2°C target” is really just a code-word for “almost complete decarbonisation by 2050”.
To reach the “2°C target”, Rahmstorf claims that “not a single conventional power plant must be allowed to be built globally after 2017” and that the planet would have to reduce its GHG emissions 10% by 2020. An impossibility.
And slowly it is beginning to dawn on the diehard warmists that reaching this pie-in-the-sky CO2 reduction target is a pipe dream of the 10th order. In fact the opposite trend is today’s reality: CO2 emissions rose in 2012 and coal is making a comeback. Geden sees it, and commented on the “2°C target”: “We are living in a fantasy world.” Geden is now asking his fellow warmists to come to terms with this reality.
But the warmists and Rahmstorf refuse to hear it. If the 2°C target is abandoned, then the whole thing goes.

Rahmstorf blames the spiraling failure on policymakers, saying: “the political resolve is missing“. Yet Rahmstorf and the audience refused to share Geden’s pessimism and demands to face the reality. According to klimaretter, Rahmstorf defiantly declared: “We will fight to the end!” The crowd applauded for the first time, klimaretter writes.
Klimaretter at the very end poses the following (remarkable) question:
Are we playing into the hands of the climate protection opponents when someone like Geden requests that we really have to be honest and declare the 2°C target almost impossible to reach?”
Say what! Yes. this is the question the warmists are now struggling with. Put in simple words: “Do we accept reality, or is it better to keep pretending (so that we don’t maybe play into the wrong hands)?” Unbelievable lows the warmists have maneuvered themselves into.
It’s over. They’re in their bunkers with hands trembling.
Reader krawallo comments:
When mankind stops believing in God, but then indeed in science?
But when science researches only nonsense, then eventually mankind stops believing in science. And then the conferences fail.

If not, Laila Laurel has designed just the chair for you. If you are a man and are guilty of manspreading then she has the cure; if you are a woman and are guilty of not womanspreading then she has a chair for that as well. 



Don’t laugh – she picked up a top award for the design. This is clearly an exciting solution to one of humankind’s greatest problems.



Laila Laurel, 23, says she was inspired to create the chair, which makes use of two cleverly positioned bits of wood, following her own experiences of ‘manspreading’.



If you’re unaware, ‘manspreading’ is the term used to describe when some fellas sit with their legs wide apart in public places, with a disregard for other people’s personal space. It became a talked-about phenomenon back in 2013 and has since even been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.



Laurel, who is set to graduate with a degree in 3D Design and Craft from the University of Brighton later this month, said: “It came both from my own experiences of men infringing on my space in public, and also from ‘The Everyday Sexism Project’, a website founded by Laura Bates in which women self-testify about sexism they experience.



“With my chair set I hoped to draw awareness to the act of sitting for men and women and inspire discussion around this.”



Her work has been awarded the Belmond Award for emerging talent, with a judging panel saying Laurel’s chair was ‘ **a bold, purpose-driven design that explores the important role of design in informing space, a person’s behaviour and society issues of today** ‘.



I presume it will also solve climate change, but that was not explicitly mentioned in the judges’ citation.



The award looks for designs that show ‘imaginative and cleverly presented ideas with a considered overall look and feel along with the quality of work displayed’.



Laurel, who is from Norwich, said: “I am completely shocked but very happy and honoured to have won the Belmond Award – and I am looking forward to designing with them this year.” […]



Laurel hasn’t stopped there with her chair designs either. She’s created a second seat intended for women, which encourages them to sit with their legs a little wider apart.



There is a whole lot more beauty and functionality in the drainpipe than either of those ugly monstrosities.

Normally the answer to that question would revolve around whether you had been out playing in the mud with your 4×4 or the time elapsed since you last visited the carwash or got out the bucket and cloth.



But no, in the brave new world of climate idiocy, ‘dirty’ now refers to a colourless, odourless, harmless gas that feeds our economy by growing vegetation.



The **Government has dirty cars in its sights** and newly-released industry figures show that some of the most expensive motor vehicle brands available in New Zealand produce the **most pollution.**



The carbon dioxide emissions of all car brands sold in New Zealand in 2018 have been revealed by the Motor Industry Association, with luxury marque Rolls-Royce topping the list with an average of 326 grams of CO2 per kilometre travelled.



That’s more than double our **cleanest** fossil-fuelled brand, with cars from French manufacturer Citroen averaging 122g per km.



Brands that typically sell cars – or vans – with bigger engines rank further up the average emissions list.



Flat at the bottom of the list, however, is US electric car maker Tesla whose cars all run solely on electricity and don’t produce carbon emissions.



Other luxury brands are big emitters too, with McLaren, Bentley and Ferrari all averaging over 200g per km.



Lamborghini sits behind Rolls-Royce with 316g per km.



It should come as no surprise that most of the biggest emitters are brands noted for their big-engined sports cars and it’s important to note that they make up a small fraction of our national fleet. […]



  
CO2 is not, and never has been, a pollutant. 



CO2 is not, and never has been, ‘dirty’.



You cannot find an image of CO2 online, so they have to photoshop it in using water vapour (aka clouds):



The real pollution from cars, the real dirt, comes from small particulate matter generated by the brake pads and tyres. Last I checked the ‘clean’ EV cars also had tyres and brakes. 



Next years’ EVs will probably build on the Marty McFly Hoverboard concept to ensure that they are truly clean. Obviously they will, first, need to resolve the patent dispute with the Jetson SpaceCar Company.

In just a few hours from now, NASA rolls the STEREO BEHIND solar satellite to have a look at Comet Elenin (P/2010 X1), and if you haven’t been paying attention, it is one red hot topic topped with wilder imaginations, dooms, hypotheticals and omens than previously imagined. 
From being on a par with/substitute for Niburu to a first ever hyperbolic (&gt;1) cometary orbit, you’d be hard pressed to make the relevant data up.  Perihelion somewhat around Sept 11, 2011 (maybe they changed it, maybe not) and origin from the Oort Cloud to an interstellar rogue object.  Composition unknown.

"**A couple travelling from Essex to deliver Christmas presents to family were among those stopped for breaking coronavirus laws in Cardiff.**
South Wales Police stopped more than 100 vehicles in the capital on Friday and Saturday.
Twelve people were fined and a further 15 people were asked to leave the city.
Ch Sup Wendy Gunney said people continuing to break the rules were putting others at ""increased risk"".
South Wales Police were granted extra powers, including random vehicle checks, around Cardiff which started from 09:00 GMT on so-called Black Friday.
The checks will continue until 17:00 on Sunday.
Among the 110 people stopped by police in the first 24 hours were a couple who told officers they had travelled from Essex, despite England remaining in lockdown until Wednesday.
A group of nine people travelling in convoy to visit friends in university, were also turned around by officers.
Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown ended on 9 November, allowing pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers to reopen, with social-distancing measures in place.
While there are no travel restrictions within Wales, it is currently against the law to travel across the border - in or out - unless you have an essential reason.
The Welsh Government has introduced a ""restricted list of essential purposes"" to allow people to travel between the nations, such as going to work.
The regulations also prevent travel anywhere else outside of Wales.
Under the coronavirus fixed penalty notices system, people can be fined Â£60 for a first offence, which increases to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920.
If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine.
Ch Sup Gunney said: ""I would like to thank the vast majority of people who are enjoying their weekend with caution and within the confines of the existing regulations, but those not adhering to the rules are continuing to put others at increased risk.
""The measures which are in place are in place for a reason. Our checks will continue throughout the weekend, and anybody blatantly flouting the rules, which have been made very clear, face being fined."""

Writing for _Forbes_ , Bruce Bartlett puts forth an interesting hypothesis that healthcare legislation could have been made better (hopefully he meant to write ""less destructive"") if the GOP had been willing to compromise with Democrats:   




Democrats desperately wanted a bipartisan bill and would have given a lot to get a few Republicans on board. This undoubtedly would have led to enactment of a better health bill than the one we are likely to get. But Republicans never put forward an alternative health proposal. Instead, they took the position that our current health system is perfect just as it is.



Bruce makes several compelling points in the article, especially when he notes that it will be virtually impossible to repeal a bad bill after 2010 or 2012, but there are good reasons to disagree with his analysis. First, he is wrong in stating that Republicans were united against any compromise. Several GOP senators spent months trying to negotiate something less objectionable, but those discussions were futile. Also, I'm not sure it's correct to assert Republicans took a ""the current system is perfect"" position. They may not have offered a full alternative (they did have a few good reforms such as allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines), but their main message was that the Democrats were going to make the current system worse. Strikes me as a perfectly reasonable position, one that I imagine Bruce shares.   
  
Let's explore Bruce's core hypothesis: Would compromise have generated a better bill? It's possible, to be sure, but there are also several reasons why that approach may have backfired:   
  
1\. It's not clear a policy of compromise would have produced a less-objectionable bill. Would Senate Democrats have made more concessions to Grassley and Snowe rather than Lieberman and Nelson (much less whether the ""concessions"" would have been good policy)? And even if Reid made some significant (and positive) concessions, is there any reason to think those reforms would have survived a conference committee with the House? Yet the compromising Republicans probably would have felt invested in the process and obliged to support the final bill — even if the conference committee produced something worse than the original Senate Democrat proposal.   




2\. A take-no-prisoners strategy may be high risk, but it can produce high rewards. In the early 1990s, the Republicans took a no-compromise position when fighting Bill Clinton's health plan (aka, Hillarycare), and that strategy was ultimately successful. We still don't know the final result of this battle (much less how events would have transpired with a different strategy), but if the long-term goal is to minimize government expansion, a no-compromise approach is perfectly reasonable.   
  
3\. A principled opposition to government-run healthcare will help win other fights. The Democrats ultimately may win the healthcare battle, but the leadership will have been forced to spend lots of time and energy, and also use up lots of political chits. Does anyone now think they can pass a ""climate change"" bill? The answer, almost certainly, is no.   
  
4\. A principled approach can be good politics, which can eventually lead to good policy. Democrats wanted a few Republicans on board in part to help give them political cover. The aura of bipartisanship would have given Democrats a good talking point for the 2010 elections (""My opponent is being unreasonable since even X Republicans also supported the legislation""). That fig leaf does not exist now, which makes it more likely that Democrats will pay a heavy price during the midterm elections. It is impossible to know whether 2010 will be a 1994-style rout or whether the newly-elected Republicans will quickly morph into Bush-style big-government conservatives (who often do more damage to liberty than Democrats), but at least there is a reasonable likelihood of more pro-liberty lawmakers.   
  
When all is said and done, Bruce's strategy is not necessarily wrong, but it does guarantee defeat. Government gets bigger and freedom diminishes. For reasons of principle and practicality, Republicans should do the right thing.

It seems that there’s no nanny-state soapbox too pointless that local councils can’t work themselves up into a virtue-signalling lather about it.



Once upon a time, ratepayers laboured under the impression that the role of local councils was to see to it that the rubbish was collected, local business was encouraged, and the neighbourhood kiddies had somewhere decent to kick a ball. Not any more, apparently. Councils these days have far bigger concerns than such trivialities as delivering services to ratepayers.



Councils today seem to have made it their mission to save the world from innumerable perils, from climate change and drinking straws to teenagers popping pingers.



A Hobart culture and events committee has unanimously voted in favour of supporting a pill testing trial at the city’s major events.



The notice of motion set out to minimise the harms associated with illicit drug use at festivals, events, pubs, clubs and venues in Hobart by having in-principle support of pill testing at Hobart events and festivals.



Naturally, this overdose of nanny-state-ism is couched in the usual leftist nostrums of “safety” and “compassion”. However, as members of the public have responded, surely the best way to minimise the harm associated with illicit drug use **is to actually enforce the law** rather than tacitly encourage law-breaking?



 _Can they put a new lane on the Brooker [Highway] for drunks?_ one Hobart local asked. Another wondered whether, if pulled up for a roadside drug test, users could _just say u are heading to the festival to get them checked?_



The trial would require the state government’s support, but its stance against pill testing had remained firm, with newly appointed Health Minister Sarah Courtney saying pill testing was not supported by the government.



“I think it’s very important that as a government we are not sending mixed messages to young people about whether illicit drugs are safe to use or not,” she said…



After the NSW coronial inquest into six drug-related deaths on the mainland, Cr Ewin said staff would put together a brief and a letter of support to the state government, outlining the council’s stance on pill testing and welcoming a trial in Hobart.



“Safety” is, of course, the great lie being peddled here. Pill-testing merely establishes whether the drugs have likely been adulterated – “cut”, as we used to say – with anything from glucose to rat poison. But, just because a tablet is pure MDMA does not make it “safe”. **Most of the deaths from pill-taking at festivals have been overdoses** , not tainted drugs.



It says a great deal about the mental acuity of the average pill-taker, in fact, that evidence shows that a significant percentage consume their drugs even **after** testing shows that they have been adulterated.



A representative from Alcohol, Tobacco, and other Drugs Council Tasmania gave a presentation on what pill testing is and isn’t to the Community, Culture and Events Committee at the Wednesday night meeting.



  
Almost certainly not discussed was the single, basic fact about pill-testing: it’s **your** problem, druggo. No-one else’s.



Pill-testing kits are easily available on ebay for a few dollars. _If people can afford the event tickets and afford to buy the drugs then they should also pay for the pills to be tested themselves_ , said another Hobart resident. _How about people accepting responsibility for their stupidity instead of us taxpayers having to fund things like pill testing. Simple solution. If you take illicit drugs, you know the risks._



Now, in **my** day, you took that brown acid and you rode that bad trip like a man. Unfortunately, “personal responsibility” is a foreign concept to a generation who’ve been raised with the message that everything is a “right” and taxpayers have to give it to them.

"**The University of Surrey will drop entry requirements by one grade for most students applying for undergraduate courses next year.**
Grades will be lowered to ""relieve the pressure and anxiety"" for students, who have had their learning disrupted by the pandemic across two academic years.
It is the second institution to make the move within a week.
The government said it will publish plans ""shortly"" on how it will manage disruption to exam pupils in England.
Lizzie Burrows, director of recruitment and admissions at the University of Surrey, said: ""We are taking this action now to relieve the pressure and anxiety facing this year's applicants, as they experience ongoing disruption and uncertainty surrounding exams and assessment of their learning.
""By taking this step, we can provide one additional element of certainty and reassurance that these students will be protected from unfair disadvantage as a result of the impact of the pandemic.""
Regulated courses such as veterinary medicine, foundation year courses, four-year integrated masters programmes and audition-based performance courses will be exempt from the grade reduction, the university said.
Earlier this month, the University of Birmingham became the first higher education institution to reduce entry requirements in recognition of the impact of the pandemic.
For each university course there is an expected threshold in terms of A-level grades, and now Surrey is saying it will accept one grade lower in one subject this year.
So a student applying to study chemistry will only have to reach two Bs and a C at A-level, whereas in previous years it would have been three Bs.
This move by a large university may be an early sign of how flexible universities will be with this year's applicants.
The University of Birmingham has already said it will also be dropping requirements by one grade in one subject.
A-level exams in England are expected to go ahead, and ministers will be under pressure to find a way of recognising that some students have had learning more disrupted than others.
That could prove difficult but a more forgiving approach by universities could compensate."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday’s totalitarian ideas are always disguised as righteous plans to ensure “fairness” and “social justice” and they often start in Europe. Then the US Democrats drool over them and scheme to sneak them into the US.
The latest in Europe is to take much more control over the media. German flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has a piece called: EU Advisers Wish To Monitor Media More Strictly. Hat-tip: www.achgut.com/. To what extent this will impact blogs, I have no idea.
A group of EU Commission advisers say, “Europe’s freedom of the press is in danger” and so Europe has to act. Right!
The advisers are calling for stricter state monitoring of the media. According to the FAZ, the group says, “Some media outlets should be financially supported.” And others not?
Anyone living in Europe following the media to any extent knows that Europe’s traditional mainstream leftist media are in dire straits. A number of center-left dailies have recently bitten the dust, and so we suppose they are now looking for generous handouts.
The FAZ writes that stricter monitoring by the EU state would “ensure pluralism and quality”. The group of advisors proposes that the “European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights should monitor freedom of the press and free speech in member states”. You see, today there are media outlets out there who feel their rights to free speech are being infringed because citizens are no longer interested in paying for their crap. Now the government should force citizens to pay for crap that nobody wants – through subsidies.
The advisors also say an “independent monitoring agency“ made up of scientists could be set up. The advisers say that “more pluralism must be achieved, especially in the online media“.

The advisory group is hardly made up of lightweight bureaucrats. It includes former German Justice Minister Herta Däubler-Gmelin (who once compared President George W. Bush to Hitler) and Latvia former President Varia Vike-Freiberga. Däubler-Gmelin for example is calling on Europe to require its member states to have “independent media panels that would impose fines, force counter views, or revoke media licenses”, and to make sure these member-state media panels “abide to European values”. Sounds like free-speech policing to me.
The advisers believe that “freedom of the press is threatened by political powers, excessive commercial power, new business models, changing media landscape and the rise of new media.”
The FAZ writes:
One particularly large problem the advisers find is the creeping loss of quality in reporting, as Ms. Vike-Freiberga showed. Among other things, it arises from the new media like in the Internet where anyone is allowed to disseminate information. “For this reason the group also proposes that it is also essential for the state to support unprofitable media are essential.”
The panels also says that media should comply to a code of conduct and guidelines for publishing.
So, will Obama try again to push through the Fairness Act in USA? Don’t be surprised if he does.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader sent an e-mail to the University of Graz concerning Prof Richard Parncutt’s call for the death penalty (see following figure) for those who dare to doubt IPCC climate dogma.

Snipped from: http://www.webcitation.org/6D8yy8NUJ.
Here’s the reply the reader got from the University of Graz by email today:
Die Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz ist bestürzt und entsetzt über die Ansicht und distanziert sich davon klar und deutlich. Die Universität legt größten Wert, dass die Wahrung aller Menschenrechte zu den obersten Prinzipien der Universität Graz gehört und menschenverachtende Aussagen mit aller Entschiedenheit zurückgewiesen werden. Die Universität weist zusätzlich mit Nachdruck darauf hin, dass eine rein persönliche Ansicht, die nicht im Zusammenhang mit der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit steht, auf universitären Webseiten nicht toleriert wird.
The University of Graz is shocked and appalled by the article und rejects its arguments entirely. The University places considerable importance on respecting all human rights and does not accept inhuman statements. Furthermore, the University of Graz points out clearly that a personal and individual opinion which is not related to scientific work cannot be tolerated on websites of the University.

It is somewhat reassuring that the University of Graz is “shocked and appalled” by Prof. Parncutt’s views. But I have one little question: Why was this “inhuman” speech “tolerated” by the University for 2 months!
That is not very reassuring.
Parncutt’s “long list of climate change deniers” , i.e his designated candidates for the death penalty, he links to at the above shown site is happily provided by desmogblog.
Hate speech and this sort of incitement is illegal in some countries. Richard Parncutt and the University of Graz could be open to some serious legal challenges here, especially by those who find themselves on the “long list of climate change deniers” linked at Parncutt’s death penalty page. They may have grounds for a serious grievance here.
If I were on that list, I’d feel pretty damn threatened, let alone pissed off.
Parncutt’s site: http://www.webcitation.org/6D8yy8NUJ.
The only way out I see for the University of Graz is for them to clearly demonstrate that they welcome differing opinions and an open discussion on the subject of climate change. They could start by inviting professors and speakers who have views that differ from those of the IPCC and Prof Parncutt. That is what true academia is supposed to be about.
That’s only for starters.

From the American Chemical Society something I’ve always wondered about, that soot plays a major role in the Arctic. Controlling soot though, has to start outside of the United States, because soot emissions are already highly regulated by the EPA.
A satellite image shows pollution over eastern China in February 2004. The pollution, consisting mostly of soot and sulfate particles, was created from coal and wood burning and persisted throughout the winter.
Cutting soot emissions: Fastest, most economical way to slow global warming
DENVER, Aug. 31, 2011 — A new study of dust-like particles of soot in the air — now emerging as the second most important — but previously overlooked — factor in global warming provides fresh evidence that reducing soot emissions from diesel engines and other sources could slow melting of sea ice in the Arctic faster and more economically than any other quick fix, a scientist reported here today.

In a presentation at the 242nd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Mark Z. Jacobson, Ph.D., cited concerns that continued melting of sea ice above the Arctic Circle will be a tipping point for the Earth’s climate, a point of no return. That’s because the ice, which reflects sunlight and heat back into space, would give way to darker water that absorbs heat and exacerbates warming. And there is no known way to make the sea refreeze in the short term.
Jacobson’s calculations indicate that controlling soot could reduce warming above parts of the Arctic Circle by almost 3 degrees Fahrenheit within 15 years. That would virtually erase all of the warming that has occurred in the Arctic during the last 100 years.
“No other measure could have such an immediate effect,” said Jacobson, who is with Stanford University. “Soot emissions are second only to carbon dioxide (CO2) in promoting global warming, but its effects have been underestimated in previous climate models. Consequently, soot’s effect on climate change has not been adequately addressed in national and international global warming legislation. Soot emissions account for about 17 percent of global warming, more than greenhouse gases like methane. Soot’s contribution, however, could be reduced by 90 percent in 5-10 years with aggressive national and international policies.”
Soot or “black carbon” consists of particles, nearly invisible on an individual basis, released in smoke from combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels. Major sources include exhaust from diesel cars, buses, trucks, ships, aircraft, agricultural machines, construction equipment and the wood/animal dung fires that hundreds of millions of people in developing countries use for used for cooking and heating. Black carbon particles become suspended in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight, just like a black t-shirt on a sunny day. The particles then radiate that heat back into the air around it. Black carbon also can absorb light reflected from Earth’s surface, which helps make it such a potent warming agent.
The good news is that decreasing soot could have a rapid effect, Jacobson said. Unlike carbon dioxide, which remains in the atmosphere for years, soot disappears within a few weeks, so that there is no long-term reservoir with a continuing warming effect. And the technology for controlling black carbon, unlike that for controlling CO2, already is available at relatively modest cost. Diesel particulate filters, for instance, can remove soot from car and truck exhaust. Government and other agencies also are trying to introduce low-soot cookstoves in developing countries. “Converting gasoline- and diesel-burning cars and trucks to electric or hydrogen vehicles and reducing emissions from diesel generators could have an immediate effect on warming,” according to Jacobson.
Jacobson, who developed the first detailed climate model to include the global effects of soot, reported on use of the model to gain new insights into the effects of soot particles trapped inside and between the water droplets that make up clouds. Previous research on black carbon and climate overlooked that topic. Jacobson said the information is important because black carbon within clouds makes the clouds “burn off” and disappear over heavily polluted urban and other areas. Climate models that ignore this “cloud absorption” phenomenon underestimate the effects of black carbon on climate.

ABSTRACT:
Air pollution mortality and global warming are two significant problems today. Over 2.5 million people die prematurely each year worldwide from air pollution. Nine out of the 10 warmest years on record since 1850 were during 2000-2010. The Arctic sea ice extent has dropped 10% (1 million square kilometers) since 1979. Sea levels have risen 1.8 mm/year for the past century but 2.8 mm/year in the most recent decade. In this talk, I provide new results examining the relative contributors to global warming and air pollution health problems. Fossil-fuel and solid biofuel soot particles are found to be the second-leading cause of global warming after carbon dioxide. Whereas fossil-fuel soot is a stronger warmer than biofuel soot, biofuel soot enhances mortality about 8 times more on a global scale, since it is emitted mostly in highly-populated developing countries. Part of the strong climate effect of black carbon is due to its absorption within cloud drops. BC inclusions within cloud drops result in a greater heating rate than the same BC interstitially between cloud drops, and interstitial BC causes more heating than BC in the clear sky. As such, ignoring BC inclusions within cloud drops or between cloud drops results in underestimates of the climate effects of BC. Controlling fossil-fuel and biofuel soot appears to be the fastest method of reducing Arctic ice loss and global warming than any other control option, including control of CH4 or CO2, although all controls are needed.

"In 2008, the European carbon market crashed. Carbon emission allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) plunged from €30 per tonne of C02 in June 2008 to €7 at the beginning of 2009. Prices have fluctuated around €5 ever since. There is broad consensus on why the price remains low. Partly, it is due to the recession: lower industrial output means less demand for allowances. At the same time, other environmental policies (such as renewable energy and energy efficiency) have been promoted, and this has confused the market. Overarching these factors are the short-term approach to decision making taken by most businesses, which makes it difficult to promote the long-term benefits of environmental investment, and general uncertainty about EU and international emission targets. But is the low price a problem? The answer depends on how you view the objectives of the scheme. Some see the emissions trading as a mechanism established purely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time at the lowest possible cost. From this perspective, the current low price is due to the interplay of supply and demand, and there is no need for intervention. Others think the scheme should also provide a clear price signal to support technological innovation. In other words, the carbon price must be high enough to discourage large investments that lock in companies to highly polluting, high-carbon technologies for decades to come. Instead, companies would be encouraged to invest early in low carbon technologies. From this point of view, the current low price is a problem that must be fixed. The debate around emissions trading reform has become polarised and political. The real issue is lack of responsiveness to changing current events in a system designed with decade-long timescales in mind. Unforeseen events, such as a change in economic conditions or new technological developments, can trigger dramatic changes in demand. To function properly, an emissions trading scheme needs to be able to respond to these changes. A responsiveness mechanism may be the answer. The scheme could be adapted to include an override that would lessen the impact of excessive undersupply or oversupply of allowances. Ideally, such a mechanism would be clear and transparent. Clear, so that every buyer and seller in the market is able to understand how it operates. And transparent, with the system data readily available to ensure the mechanism could not be gamed or subject to political lobbying. What are the options? Some stakeholders support the creation of a “price collar” – a price floor to prevent the price falling so low as to discourage innovation, and a price ceiling to cap costs for industries covered by the scheme. This sounds straightforward but it is difficult to set appropriate price thresholds. The price ceiling, in particular, might well be set to protect against only politically unacceptable high prices. Others, including the European Commission, support the creation of a market stability reserve. Here, the commission would automatically add and withhold allowances from the market based on a set of rules agreed in advance. Triggers could be based on various indicators, such as the overall number of allowances in circulation. Depending on the design of the rules, a market stability reserve could be relatively clear and simple to understand. However, for it to be transparent the quantitative data used to determine the triggers should be available to market participants. Price data is readily and continuously observable from the market, but the commission has historically been slow to release quantitative data on allowance usage, and the data has been subject to restrictions. In this context, it is troubling that the European Commission has recently decided to stop releasing information on the extent to which firms use international carbon offsets, where polluting companies buy credits from others who are making emissions reductions in lieu of making their own. While this is part of the system’s normal functioning, the quality of international offset credits purchased from outside the EU ETS – in terms of representing genuine, effective carbon emissions reductions – lacks transparency, and can be dubious or exposed to fraud. The market reserve mechanism will only operate correctly if firms can respond promptly and appropriately to the triggers – and this will require greater system transparency than the commission is providing."
"**Aberdeen is not a Covid hotspot yet the pressure on hospital and intensive care staff is still starting to show.**
The patient count at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) is not as high as some of Scotland's worst-hit hospitals but numbers are increasing.
We spent less than an hour in ""pod 1"" of ARI's Covid ICU and it was a total reality check on the effect of the second wave of the virus.
Eighty-three-year-old Meg Thomson is one of 11 patients being treated there.
Against the constant hiss of oxygen and the beeping of monitors, Meg tells me she doesn't know where she contracted the virus or how she ended up in ICU but, with grit and stoicism, she is determined to get better.
""I dinnae give up very easily,"" she says. ""I've got my ups and downs but I feel positive.""
In the neighbouring bed, 65-year-old Dot Bright says she started feeling unwell just over a week ago. After deteriorating rapidly, she was admitted to the ICU.
""The night before I was brought in here, I thought I was finished,"" she says
""It's the biggest scare I've had in my life. Take it serious.""
In the last month, the number of Covid patients in hospital have doubled and the staff in ICU know that means there will be more needing critical care in the next few weeks.
Working 12-hour shifts in visors, gloves, gowns and masks is hot and uncomfortable.
Every time you enter or leave ""the pod"" the protracted routine of donning and doffing must take place. And that goes for the nurses and doctors as well as domestic staff bringing in equipment or taking the bins away.
Chloe Burdett has been an ICU nurse for three years and she says everyone is tired and trying to stay motivated.
""To know that people are so unwell, when we thought we'd gotten over that, it's very difficult to see that again and know it's still out there and it's still a threat to everyone,"" she says.
Helen Paddon, the head nurse for critical care, says it has been the most difficult year of her nursing career.
""The nursing staff are working longer hours than they should do, in full PPE,"" she says.
Staff here say they have been lucky to escape the full impact of the second wave felt in other parts of Scotland.
But a specialist national unit, which is based in the Aberdeen ICU, means they treat some of the sickest Covid patients in Scotland.
The ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) unit, ""pod 2"", has special machines that take on the work of the lungs. It is often the younger people who will be put on ECMO as they are the most likely to survive.
Dr Iain Macleod heads up all the hospital's critical care. He tells me that better treatments this time mean more people can avoid intensive care but those who do come tend to stay for some time.
""What we're seeing this time is more of a slow burn, patients are here for longer, they remain very sick,"" he says.
And like all hospitals this time round, other work continues.
For the critical care team that means running and staffing two intensive care units, one for Covid patients and one for non-Covid.
""Intensive care is an emotionally-charged environment but this year is like nothing I have ever seen before,"" Dr Macleod says.
""Our team have been working incredibly hard over the last six months and there is no end in sight.""
Visiting is not allowed in order to limit the number of people in the hospital but I was granted rare access, alongside a camera operator, because the staff felt it was important that people understood just how serious the threat of this virus is.
And it is distressing to see.
Dot and Meg have turned a corner but there are others in the unit who might not make it.
The staff have to deal with that and they have to deal with working in full PPE, getting used to smiling with their eyes as they comfort frightened patients.
They also have to deal with their own fears of the virus, their own stresses of seeing people so critically ill, and taking that home at the end of a busy shift to everyday family life.
Dot tells me: ""The people in here can't be more helpful. They stand here for four or five hours without a break. They're here with you all the time."""

From the AGU today, I find they are moving the cause of ancient planetary disaster from comets impacts and volcanoes or other big events to CO2 causing acidification of the oceans, literally they have a blast from the gas, to make CO2 the villain here. Of course, it’s just another modeling exercise in uncertainty.
The Permian–Triassic (P-Tr) extinction event is the most significant extinction event in this plot for marine genera. Source Wikipedia
From Wikipedia, a clear cut case of “we don’t know“:
There are several proposed mechanisms for the extinctions; the earlier phase was likely due to gradual environmental change, while the latter phase has been argued to be due to a catastrophic event. Suggested mechanisms for the latter include large or multiple bolide impact events, increased volcanism, and sudden release of methane clathrate from the sea floor; gradual changes include sea-level change, anoxia, increasing aridity, and a shift in ocean circulation driven by climate change.
From the AGU Highlights:
1. Was ocean acidification responsible for history’s greatest extinction?
Two hundred and fifty million years ago, the world suffered the greatest recorded extinction of all time. More than 90 percent of marine animals and a majority of terrestrial species disappeared, yet the cause of the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) die-off remains unknown. Various theories abound, with most focusing on rampant Siberian volcanism and its potential consequences: global warming, carbon dioxide poisoning, ocean acidification, or the severe drawdown of oceanic dissolved oxygen levels, also known as anoxia.

To narrow down the range of possible causes, Montenegro et al. ran climate simulations for the PTB using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model, a carbon cycle-climate coupled general circulation model. The model’s highlights include dynamic representations of terrestrial vegetation, ocean carbon fluxes, and net primary production. The researchers ran nine simulations, using three different concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, three modes of ocean floor topography, and two competing theories for the geography of the time.
The authors find that varying the ocean floor topography by adding deep ocean ridges increases the strength of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) – a convective cycle that mixes ocean waters. Also, the presence of the MOC was not abated by elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide as was found in previous research, suggesting that the ocean would have been well mixed and well oxygenated, restricting the chances of widespread deep ocean anoxia.
Further, the researchers find that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were 3000 parts per million by volume or higher, fitting within estimates for the Permian-Triassic boundary, the ocean pH would have been 7.34 or lower. At those levels, the authors say the ocean’s acidity would have had significant negative impacts on mollusks, corals, and other species that rely on oceanic calcium carbonate, suggesting ocean acidification may have been the main culprit in the Permian-Triassic boundary extinction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSomeone please tell us where’s the warming
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has released the global mean temperature figure for 2012. The anomaly is +0.56° Celsius. A look at the last 30 years (a climate-relevant time-period) shows a global temperature stagnation:

Temperature anomaly (in hundredths of a degree) from 1983 to 2012.
This has created a commotion in the media. Spiegel has taken notice and reported of “puzzled scientists”. Perhaps we can lend them a hand in finding the missing heat. The 5-year moving average has been flat since 2002 – a full decade. There really hasn’t been any significant increase since 1997; that’s 16 years. James Hansen (see our blog report: “Who is James Hansen?“), released the temperature data while publishing an enlightening paper (Hansen et al. 2013, pdf). In it he acknowledges the temperature rise stop and attributes it mainly to the effects of natural variability. Global ocean heat content (OHC) of the upper 700 meters has also flattened, especially since 2004:

Therefore it is argued that since the beginning of the millenium the heat must have been transported to the ocean depths, down to 2000 meters. However, from those depths, little data is available. As a whole, everything appears vague and imprecise. Yet, there is something we wish to take a closer look at. Question: Where could this have possibly taken place? Here’s a look at the heat content (down to 700 m depth) of the Southern Hemisphere:

 
Here the trend is uninterrupted. There’s been no change in trend since 1990. Now let’s take a look at the Northern Hemisphere:

 
Here nothing has warmed in the last 10 years (see our blog article “A look at the global mean temperature in 2013. Is cooling ahead!“). In the meantime, this is what we have found, also published at climate website climate4you:

 
The above is the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) of the North Atlantic above 30° north, which is also known as the AMO region, which is where the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation takes place. The dataset shows the anomaly from the detrended sea surface temperatures (SST). A look at the region of impact shows that a huge area of the Northern Hemisphere is impacted:

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




 
Depicted above is the correlation of the AMO region with the global temperatures (positive correlation in orange, red violet). In the Northern hemisphere large regions are effected: USA, Central America and all of Europe, up to the Urals and also the Far East. In the Southern Hemisphere there’s practically no correlation! There the AMO does not play a role. What’s the relationship to ocean heat content (OHC)?

 
The above chart shows how the course of the OHC, whose magnitude in the North Atlantic has been dropping since 2004, correlates with the entire OHC of the Northern Hemisphere since 2004. The “cold colors” show the areas of water that behave like or similarly to the North Atlantic, i.e. in decline. In regions where warm colours rule, OHC is rising and thus counters the North Atlantic.  In the ocean regions where the AMO has an effect (see the preceding chart ), OHC behaves like the North Atlantic. Only the Northeast Pacific is out of sync. Here a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has been in play for quite some time now. OHC in the North Pacific also has not been doing much since the year 2000:

 
The decline in OHC in the Northern Hemisphere could be well connected to the effect of the AMO. The flattening out of the OHC is very likely an AMO signal, which began to decline in 2005. Or is the North Atlantic being massively impacted by the anthropogenic aerosols (which are often used as an explanation) to explain the AMO? This is likely not the case because the chart showing the distribution of tropospheric aerosols indicates that the North Atlantic is one of the regions of the Northern Hemisphere that is impacted the least.

Figure from Shindell 2007.
So here it’s likely that the thermohaline circulation is offsetting the temperature driving greenhouse gas effects. If the early phase of the falling AMO has been able to offset the effect of anthropogneic greenhouse gases for years, then the rising AMO’s impact on temperatures during the period of 1975 to 1997 had to have been half of the entire observed warming during the period.  This would have profound consequences for the prognoses: The effect of the greenhouse gas was only 50% responsible for the warming since the intensive industrialization since 1960.
Implicitly, maybe late – but not too late – the British MetOffice recognized this as it recently corrected its prognosis for the coming years (see blog article “The avalanche gathers speed: British Weather Service drastically reduces its warming prognoses until 2020“). It concedes the effect when it explains: “In this case, changes in ocean surface temperatures in some parts of the world over the past year are understood to have made a key contribution to the difference between the 2011 and 2012 forecasts…”.
Therefore we should prepare for a long phase of stagnation if the AMO continues falling for decades. This is even simulated in a little known paper (Wouters et al. 2012). The authors are able to reporoduce the variability without the anthropogenic influence.
Summary
Temperatures have been flat for more than 10 years and the OHC of the North Atlantic reached its peak 7 years ago. We have shown that global temperatures follow the OHC there (see: “A preview of global mean temperature in 2013: Cooling ahead!“). We now see that the temperature course over the years followed the OHC, in harmony with the AMO. Cycles, particularly the oceans, were always suspected in the IPCC reports. Such cycles, however, are obvious and lead to the conclusion that manmade greenhouse gases are only 50% responsble for the warming. The impact of the thermohaline circulation on the climate is a key to understanding climate change and to what we can expect in the years ahead.
Another key is the sun. If a Maunder-type of minimum occurs, then we will certainly not see any temperature increase of the type vehemently postulated in the IPCC reports. These are exciting times – stay curious!

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: This story has only been confusion. It appears the new record was never set. Now it seems the source has been the Daily Mail, a story they wrote in January. Other outlets picked up on it, and information seems to have gotten lost and changed along the way. The Mail writes the -71.2°C reading was taken in 1924. But I guess it never became official, or something.
My conclusion: Nobody knows what the record temperature in Siberia really is. Someone else can work on it. I’m finished with this story!
==============================
Russia is a country filled with mystery and tales. Yesterday I wrote here there were reports that a new record low temperature had been set for the northern hemisphere, in Oymyakon, Siberia: -71.2°C.
However that record remains unconfirmed so far. But media outlets have been reporting on it, examples:
Public Post.ru/:
Село Оймякон — самая холодная точка на планете. На днях тут похолодало до минус 71 градуса — это самая низкая температура за всю историю измерения. Предыдущий рекорд был в 1933 году, когда ударил мороз минус 67,8 градусов.
In English (Bing translation):
The village of Oymyakon is the coldest point on the planet. The other day here it became colder to minus 71 degrees is the lowest temperature ever measured. The previous record was in 1933, when the frost hit minus 67.8 degrees.”
borlife.de reports here:

Oymyakon: Coldest Town in the World – 71 ° Celsius
It was just a few days ago that Oymyakon became famous. With -71° Celsius, it recorded a new record cold temperature, which until then had been unique to 2 villages. Until then the record of -68°C had to be shared with the town of Werchojansk – however, this is now history.”
Meteo Portale Italia:
Un nuovo record di freddo è stato stabilito nella giornata di oggi in Siberia. Nella città di Oymyakon è stato raggiunto l’incredibile valore di -71°C! Battuto il precedente record di -68°C che resisteva ormai dal lontano 1933. Tutta la Siberia e la Russia stanno sperimentado una fase di gelo intenso, con -50°C toccati anche nella regione di Dzalinda.”
In English, that’s something like:
A new record cold was recorded today in Siberia. In the town of Oymyakon the incredible value of -71.2°C was reached, beating the record of -68°C set in 1933. All of Siberia and Russia are in a phase of intense frost. with -50°C in the region of of Dzalinda.”
Germany’s Die Welt:
The Siberian location of Oymyakon has broken the record for the lowest temperature of all time. With -71°C it is the coldest town in the world. Even the traffic signs are iced over.”
Record? So far no one has been able to confirm it officially.

"There has been an anxious search for new sources of fossil fuels, and shale gas appears to offer Britain a key national resource. But the nation’s new-found hydrocarbon wealth has met with far from universal approval. The first company to be granted a licence to drill for shale, Cuadrilla, found itself in the Battle of Balcolme last summer as environmental activists and Sussex villagers clashed with police over the drilling site. There are now only 12 months to go before a general election. With the coalition government keen to make the most of Britain’s reserves, public opinion of fracking could be important to the outcome of the next election. Advocates describe shale gas as “game-changing”, able to radically reduce Britain’s reliance on imported fuel and cut household energy costs. But opponents state the process of fracking – blasting water underground at high pressure to shatter rocks and release gas – is risky and environmentally damaging with little-understood health risks. Many Conservatives appear to be highly supportive of the “dash for shale”, while others worry about the voting implications of drilling in Tory shire county strongholds. Although Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg offered cautious support last year, prominent Liberal Democrats have distanced themselves. Labour’s position is more difficult to decipher, with elements of support and staunch opposition. Former Conservative energy minister Lord Howell this week repeated his comments of last year that fracking should go ahead in the “desolate” north, avoiding at all costs the Tory strongholds of the southern counties. Evidently, the lack of consensus between and within the parties on fracking means that any dash for shale gas is some way off yet. As part of our project examing climate change as a complex social issue, my colleagues and I examined how the issue is framed socially and politically by looking at how fracking is presented in the British broadsheet press and in British public opinion polls.  Our analysis of the UK media’s reporting of fracking revealed occasions when it was heavily split between those against (The Guardian and Independent) and those for (The Times and Telegraph). Reported in April 2011, the Gasland documentary film followed the experiences of residents affected by fracking in the US including memorable scenes of setting fire to gas-infused tap water. In April 2011, Cuadrilla’s fracking in Lancashire caused a seismic event. In both cases, a clear divide was seen, with pro-fracking outlets refering to “seismic activity” or “tremors”, and anti-fracking outlets referring to “earthquakes”, or rubbishing the facts or motives of the Gasland film. We should not lose sight of public opinion among the rhetoric in the newspapers. My colleagues and I have been conducting survey research via YouGov in order to gauge the British public’s perceptions of fracking, conducting six large surveys since 2012. Interestingly, respondents overwhelmingly endorsed fracking in Britain. But the trend of growing support for and declining opposition to fracking was reversed in July 2013, perhaps as a consequence of the considerable coverage of the altercation in Balcolme, and the strong explanations of the risks involved. If it is the case that, on the whole, the British public is open to the prospect of fracking, why is this the case, and why are they supportive despite the representations of risk in the media?  I have argued that love of lifestyle may outweigh fears over fracking. Human beings generally resist change, try to maintain a sense of continuity and control. Fracking, with its promise of cheap, secure energy, may be viewed as a means to this end, with the risks downplayed. Of course, this is very much dependent on the sorts of messages found in the media and the mouths of politicians. What our work shows is that the way fracking is framed, socially, linguistically, ideologically, is pivotal in shaping the debate. These framings shape our risk perceptions and tell us how we should act, and can persuade us towards one position or another despite the potential risks or benefits.  Essentially, both the pro- and anti-fracking camps are engaged in a struggle of representation. While one camp constructs the practice of fracking as excessively risky, the other camp minimises, normalises and justifies the risks.  There is much political ambivalence about fracking, with no single major political party having taken a firm party-wide stance on the technology. However, with growing public endorsement, it may be the case that the major political parties will view fracking as something that the British public wants and, ultimately, will vote for. "
"Scotland is renowned for its seabirds, thanks to landmarks such as the Bass Rock, Ailsa Craig and St Kilda. There are around five million of the birds, including 95% of the EU’s great skuas, 67% of its northern gannets and 65% of its black-legged kittiwakes.  But numbers are declining fast, with shortages of prey and habitat problems conspiring to affect the birds’ breeding success. According to a new RSPB report commissioned by the Scottish government, the declines date back as far as 1986. They have been greatest for Arctic skua (an 80% drop), Arctic tern (72%) and black-legged kittiwake (68%). Under the European birds directive, member states have a duty to protect habitats for the conservation of birds, including developing special protected areas. Although these areas already exist for seabird colonies on land, the RSPB urgently wants seven designated areas for birds at sea. In time it also wants the Scottish government to designate a separate set of marine protected areas to protect seabird foraging grounds.  While protected areas on land are beneficial, they only protect a limited proportion of the seabird’s life cycle. A recent ecological modelling study found that seabirds’ success at breeding is affected by the availability and quality of their prey.  Having protected areas at sea that include foraging areas may therefore protect seabird populations and boost their resilience. The sites proposed for the new special protected areas include the inner and outer sandbanks of the Firth of Forth; an area of the Pentland Firth; and the seas around Foula, Shetland.  The fall in bird populations is possibly being exacerbated by human activities at sea. People have long affected seabird populations in this way, but the variety of pressures has increased in recent years. The recent proposals for marine renewable energy developments, particularly wind but also wave and tidal, are often seen as yet another potential threat to seabirds that may be hard to justify when numbers are already falling.  Admittedly it is hard to separate the effect of marine renewable energy from other effects, particularly climate change. Much effort is being put into designing research and monitoring studies that can give us a clearer picture here. A group of scientists, civil servants and NGOs from around the globe recently met in Stornoway to discuss these issues.  Whatever the case, climate change certainly seems to be causing problems. Increased storminess is affecting bird populations, for example. In recent years we have seen huge wrecks of seabirds, with record numbers washed up dead or injured on beaches.   Scientists have also drawn a link between climate change, rising sea temperatures and shifting fish distributions, both for seabird prey species such as sandeels and larger species. A recent study documented bluefin tuna in high latitute sub-polar waters far beyond their usual habitat. It is not known how well seabirds will cope with these changes, especially during the breeding season when they are tied to a nest.  At the same time, the birds are also competing with commercial fisheries over these increasingly limited fish stocks. One problem to have made news recently is fishing boats discarding their catches. Whatever the positives of banning the practice, it is not good news for scavenger seabirds. Another threat to the birds is our addiction to plastic. On top of well known concerns about the likes of shopping bags and food wrappers, microplastics have been shown to be present, in the form of microbeads, in shower gels, face washes, toothpaste and cleaning products. These microbeads are too small to be filtered by most water treatment plants and find their way into lakes and rivers and eventually the marine environment. We are yet to fully understand the consequences of wildlife consuming plastics, but a recent four-year study by the University of Tasmania examined their toxic effects to seabirds. It found that the amounts of plastic being ingested by the birds increased during the study, and that it undermined their body condition and apparently also the chances of their chicks reaching adulthood.  All these seaborne problems lie behind the RSPB’s call for protected areas offshore. To get the best out of the strategy, it is essential that we have a good understanding of not only which areas are important for seabirds but also why. In this regard, there is still much we don’t know. Seabird tracking projects such as the RSPB’s FAME project will be key to understanding how oceanography and habitat influence seabird distributions.  We should also be mindful that seabird foraging areas may change in future depending on how climate change affects things like fish distributions. This might mean we have to change protected areas accordingly, so any network of areas needs to be flexible to ensure it fully protects the seabirds it is set to serve. The Scottish government has a legal obligation to protect seabirds, but is it not of national interest to actually have thriving populations? A recent study on the economic impact of wildlife tourism in Scotland commissioned by the Scottish government found that the net economic impact in Scotland due to wildlife tourism was £65 million, with many of the businesses focusing on seabirds.  The economic impact was also highest in the more rural Highlands and Islands region, an area that could certainly do with the boost. Put together with the legal and conservational rationales, this is one more reason why the RSPB’s proposals ought to lead to government action. "
"**Scrapping plans for a new segregated cycle path in Southsea will increase congestion and pollution, cycling campaigners have warned.**
Portsmouth City Council said its three-week trial route between Elm Grove and Kings Road would not be continued.
It had been billed as ""creating a safe space"" for cyclists, but local traders said it had disrupted business.
The Pompey Cycle Forum criticised a trial for the scheme held in November.
The lane was installed earlier this month using part of a Â£214,515 emergency active travel fund from the government, which aimed to boost cycling and walking over lockdown.
Lost parking spaces have also been restored after almost 70% of 1,400 respondentsÂ to a council survey said the lane had a ""negative impact"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Council transport chief Lynne Stagg said the scheme was halted as it was ""not supported"".
""It is a shame that it has not worked but we are committed to continuing to work with cyclists, residents and businesses along these roads,"" she added.
Khoshnaw Agha, owner of the Mediterranean Supermarket in Elm Grove, said she was ""really struggling"" with the lane in place.
She said: ""Customers had nowhere to park - some got tickets for parking on yellow lines - and it made it difficult to get our deliveries.""
Pompey Cycle Forum criticised running the trial in late autumn during the second national lockdown.
A statement said: ""There was not enough time to measure real aims of the scheme, which was to enable some residents to feel safe in switching their mode of transport away from relying on private vehicles, and towards using more sustainable methods.
""Those who would like to use pedal power more often are frightened off the roads only to increase the congestion, pollution and poor air quality."""
"**An influx of Black Friday shoppers to Cardiff prompted a shopping centre to ask visitors to wait outside as it managed social-distancing.**
St David's Cardiff tweeted it was busy and shoppers may have to wait to be let in as staff managed capacity.
Meanwhile, Transport for Wales said it would use extra staff this weekend after a rise in anti-social behaviour.
It said passenger numbers had been increasing since the end of the firebreak lockdown on 9 November.
Last weekend almost 200 people were refused travel by its staff for not wearing a face covering, anti-social behaviour or for being unfit to travel, it said.
It said more than 2,000 people across the network had to be asked to put on a face covering - a legal requirement on all public transport in Wales.
It urged people to plan ahead, check travel advice and make use of its recently-launched capacity checker to avoid busy periods.
It comes as police have been granted extra powers, including carrying out random vehicle checks, to ensure people are not breaking Covid-19 rules in Cardiff.
The powers will be in place from 09:00 GMT on Friday until 17:00 on Sunday and people breaching regulations could be fined and told to leave the city, the force said."
"1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let’s think outside the pandemic bubble.) Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel described a permanently yellow horizon: “I not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.” Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: “The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller’s are black as coal.” You’ve probably heard of Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River catching fire, but here’s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller described the Hudson south of Albany: “One great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America’s cities then. It’s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the first Earth Day in 1970 – 10% of America’s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country’s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a series of photos that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it’s hard to imagine that we tolerated this. But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we’re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can’t see them. The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today’s levels you can’t see it or smell it, and it doesn’t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That’s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don’t quite see it. And it’s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It’s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It’s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There’s no catalytic converter for CO2, which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry. That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and may even own them, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital. And so we are. Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase – the planet’s largest by market capitalization – which has funneled a quarter-trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like Liberty Mutual, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL during a pandemic. This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock announced that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to edge away from coal. And Chase – well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the protest in January that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there’s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing. Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it’s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam. Our job – a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago – is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as Donald Trump does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That’s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets last September. That’s not 20 million, but it’s on the way. We can’t be on the streets right now. So we’ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for Earth Day Live, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We’re in a race, and we’re gaining fast.

"**The UK would be making a ""terrible mistake"" to relax Covid measures just months before vaccines are expected to take effect, a leading scientist said.**
Prof Peter Openshaw, a government adviser, said the nation should not ""take the brakes off"" at this stage ""when the end is in sight"".
He said infection rates, numbers in hospital and deaths were all too high.
But he said recent trial results showed ""for sure that this is a virus we can defeat with vaccination"".
Prof Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) who works at Imperial College London, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We scientists are very concerned indeed about relaxation of precautions at this stage.
""The rates are still too high, there's too many cases coming into hospitals, too many people dying.""
England's lockdown is ending this week, when it will enter a three-tier system of restrictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the tier system would be given an expiry date of 3 February.
Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland is using a five-level system of restrictions while Northern IrelandÂ has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown.
In Wales, the hospitality industry is due to be placed under stricter rules - not yet finalised - from 4 December.
Prof Openshaw said: ""If we take the brakes off at this stage, just when the end is in sight, I think we would be making a huge mistake.""
He said it was ""extremely difficult"" to decide on the right measures against the virus but said he thought it was important to ""keep this under control and just behave very, very sensibly"".
""We've all sacrificed so much, everyone has sacrificed enormously in order to get the transmission rate down. With only a few months to go until vaccines start to have an effect I think it would just be a terrible mistake,"" the professor said.
He welcomed the initial data published showing several vaccines had high levels of effectiveness at preventing infections.
""Several trials are reporting very good efficacy and that I think means for sure that is a virus we can defeat with vaccination,"" he said.
Prof Openshaw said more data was needed to explain why the Oxford vaccine showed different levels of effectiveness in one part of the trial, in which volunteers were mistakenly given a half-dose followed by a full dose later.
The lower initial dose resulted in a 90% effectiveness rate among a smaller sample of volunteers aged under 55, while the intended regime of two full doses was 62% effective.
But he said: ""I would personally be happy to have any vaccine that's been through the regulatory scrutiny that these trials are currently undergoing.
""If my GP rings me and says I've got an approved vaccine, I really don't care which one it is.""
The UK government has purchased another two million doses of a vaccine from US biotech firm Moderna, bringing its total to seven million - enough for abut 3.5 million people.
That vaccine was shown to be 95% effective.
It has also pre-ordered 40 million doses of a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, with 10 million expected by the end of the year.
Initial data suggests it is 95% effective, with Pfizer saying it found similar results in the vulnerable over-65 population.
AstraZeneca, which is producing the Oxford vaccine, is said to have four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year, with 40 million expected by March. The government has 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine ordered in total.
Prof Openshaw said he would be ""surprised"" if reports that the Pfizer vaccine could be approved and in use next week turned out to be true, but he said there could be an announcement in the next fortnight.
The process ""mustn't be rushed"", he said."
"
Two years ago, it was “Study says global warming shrinks birds” now thanks to impressive further study, they’ve discovered it’s “Bigger birds in central California, courtesy of global climate change.“
Can’t they get their story straight? Why don’t they ask Jim Henson Hansen?
From San Francisco State University
Bigger birds in central California, courtesy of global climate change
SAN FRANCISCO — Birds are getting bigger in central California, and that was a big surprise for Rae Goodman and her colleagues.
Goodman uncovered the trend while working as a graduate student for San Francisco State University biologist Gretchen LeBuhn, analyzing data from thousands of birds caught and released each year at two sites near San Francisco Bay and the Point Reyes National Seashore. 
The SF State scientists, working with researchers from PRBO Conservation Science and the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory who collected the data, found that birds’ wings have grown longer and birds are increasing in mass over the last 27 to 40 years.
What’s making the birds bigger? The researchers think that the trend is due to climate change, but their findings put a twist in the usual thinking about climate change and body size. A well-known ecological rule, called Bergmann’s Rule, states that animals tend to be larger at higher latitudes. One reason for this rule might be that larger animals conserve body heat better, allowing them to thrive in the generally colder climate of higher latitudes.
Under this reasoning, some scientists have predicted that animals would get smaller as the Earth has warmed up over the past 100 years. But the study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, suggests that the connection may not be so simple.
Climate change may affect body size in a variety of ways, they note in their paper. For instance, birds might get bigger as they store more fat to ride out severe weather events, which are expected to be more common under global climate change. Climate change could also alter a region’s plant growth, which may eventually lead to changes in a bird’s diet that affect its size.
LeBuhn, an assistant professor of biology, said she was “completely surprised” to find that the central California birds were growing larger over time. “It’s one of those moments where you ask, ‘what’s happening here?'” The results were so unexpected, she said, that the findings made them take a step back and look more closely at how climate change could influence body size.
The bird data come from two long-term “banding stations” in central California, where a wide variety of birds are captured, banded about the leg with an identification tag, and weighed and measured before being released. Many of the same birds were captured each year, allowing the researchers at the sites to build up a unique database that could be used to track changes among the birds over several decades.
The researchers used data from 14,735 individual birds collected from 1971 to 2010 at the Palomarin Field Station, near the southern end of the Point Reyes National Seashore, by researchers from PRBO Conservation Science. Their study also included data on 18,052 birds collected between 1983 and 2009, from the Coyote Creek Field Station at the southern end of the San Francisco Bay by the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.
“At the time I started my research, a few studies had looked at body size changes in a few species in Europe and the Middle East, but no one had examined bird body size changes in North America,” said Goodman, who now teaches Biology and Environmental Science at San Francisco’s Jewish Community High School of the Bay.
“We had the good fortune to find an unexpected result — a gem in research science,” she added. “But we were then left with the puzzle of figuring out what was going on.”
After testing and discarding a number of other explanations, Goodman and her colleagues were confident that climate change was behind the longer wings and bigger bodies in most of the birds. The birds may be responding to climate-related changes in plant growth or increased climate variability in central California, the researchers suggest in the paper.
“The fingerprint of climate change is showing up in many of our ecosystems,” explains Nat Seavy, research director for the Central Coast at PRBO Conservation Science. “The challenge is to use the long-term data we’ve been collecting to understand how, where and why these changes are occurring.”
The findings offer a glimpse at the potent effects of climate change across a wide range of species, LeBuhn said. “Even over a pretty short period of time, we’ve documented changes in important traits like body size, where we don’t expect to see much flexibility.”
“But in some ways,” she added, “it gave me a little more hope that these birds are able to respond — hopefully in time — to changes in climate.”
“Although it is encouraging that species are changing in response to climate change,” said Seavy, “it is also troubling that environmental stressors are pushing and pulling on species in diverse ways…What will happen to our ecosystems as some species get larger and others get smaller? We need long-term monitoring to help us understand the impact of these changes.”

Quote of the Week:
It is scientists, not sceptics, who are most willing to consider explanations that conflict with their own. And far from quashing dissent, it is the scientists, not the sceptics, who do most to acknowledge gaps in their studies and point out the limitations of their data…’ Editorial, Nature Magazine, Jul 28, 2011.

Number of the Week: 54.5

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Videos from the Sixth International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC) sponsored by Heartland Institute are available on the web. Go to:
http://climateconference.heartland.org/watch-…
******************
Quote of the Week: The quote of the week appeared in an editorial in Nature severely criticizing those who challenge the orthodoxy and the recently held International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC). The quote is particularly rich because Nature published the famous hockey-stick by Michael Mann which included “Mann’s Nature trick” – eliminating data that contradicted the central claim. The more recent tree ring data diverged significantly from thermometer data, thus calling into question the validity of using tree rings to estimate historic temperatures. These offending data were clipped. The article must be retracted. Please see Article # 1 and articles referenced under “ICCC.”

*******************
ICCC: The attack by Nature on those who challenge the orthodoxy and the ICCC sponsored by Heartland Institute was soundly rebutted by Heartland President Joe Bast. Please see articles referenced under “ICCC.”
*******************
Number of the Week: 54.5 mpg. With great fanfare, the number of the week was announced by the US President, taking time from the critical deficit ceiling issue. By 2025, 54.5 miles per gallon shall be the average mileage of automobiles sold in the US by a manufacturer. The number was agreed to by the White House, EPA, Department of Transportation, California Air Resources Board, several major automobile manufacturers, environmentalists, etc. All the major players were represented except one – the American public – the consumer who is expected to buy the automobiles manufactured under this standard.
A quick look at the costs of automobiles on web sites, such as one by US News, gives examples of the impracticality of thinking displayed by this announcement. The vaunted Toyota Prius has an invoice price of $22,108 plus but gets only 51 mpg city and 48 mpg highway – it does not qualify under the proposed standards. Comparing apples to apples, the low cost 2012 Honda Civic has an invoice of $14,388 plus and gets 28 city and 36 highway. The hybrid version gets 44 city and 44 highway but costs 53% more with an invoice starting at $22,134. A low cost SUV, Ford Escape, gets 23 city and 28 highway with an invoice of $20,120; the hybrid version has an invoice of $29,997, or 49% more, and gets 30 city and 27 highway. Frequently, hybrids get greater mileage in the city than on the highway. The regulations are orientated for the urban public and severely punish the suburban and rural public.
What is clear is that the administration is demanding the American public bends to its will and buys electric automobiles that have yet to prove their worth at significantly higher prices than gasoline automobiles. Electric vehicles have a limited range, and those employing gasoline engines do not get the mileage that is proposed. By claiming these standards will save households money, the administration continues the mantra that by forcing the public to spend much more money for energy and transportation, the public will save money.
The President has promised that the Federal government will buy many of these new, expensive automobiles, as if Washington does not recognize there are unemployment and revenue problems. Please see articles referenced under “Subsidies and Mandates Forever.”
*******************
EPA continues its highly questionable expansion of regulatory powers based on dubious claims of public health. Even the National Academy of Sciences has warned the EPA science committee that EPA must improve on its science or face scientific irrelevance. However, it is uncertain that scientific relevance is important to the leadership of the EPA.
Reports this week indicate that, for political purposes, EPA adjusted its rules on cross state emissions it announced last week. At the last minute, many east coast states that supported the president in the last election were excluded from the rules. Texas, which certainly does not support the administration, was suddenly included. Apparently, EPA considers premature deaths, heart attacks, and asthma, which it used to justify the regulations, are a function of state political boundaries.
EPA announced that it is considering employing the Clean Air Act to regulate drilling wells for oil and natural gas extraction using hydraulic fracturing “fracking.” Drilling wells for oil started in 1859. Hydraulic fracking techniques have existed for over 60 years. Recent advances in these techniques permit a rapid development of oil and gas reserves that were previously uneconomical to extract. No doubt, affordable energy alarms this administration and EPA, so EPA must regulate it under the guise of public health, no matter how scientifically irrelevant the guise is. Please see Article # 2 and articles referenced under “EPA and other Regulators on the March.”
*******************
Australia: Although it is winter down-under, things are heating up. The government just released 340 pages of legislation to enact its proclaimed simple tax on carbon – a stunning contradiction of terms in language, logic, and science. The general population is not taking these new taxes lightly. Based on reports, a peaceful rebellion is occurring. From all parts of the island continent eleven convoys are organizing to drive to the capitol city and demand a new election. The convoys are scheduled to arrive on August 22. Please see articles under “Cap-and-Trade and Carbon Taxes.”
*******************
Models and Observations: This week, an UAH press release announced the publication of a new study by Roy Spencer and Danny Braswell estimating the extent of energy lost to space with a warming of the earth.
The new study employs an innovative lagged model, that is, one that incorporates time delays, thereby estimating energy loss over time during periods of warming. The model is adjusted in order to explain the temperature data from the Hadley Climate Research Unit in Great Britain and observations from the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments on the Terra satellite over the period 2000 to 2011. During this period there was no major warming trend but there were periods of warming and cooling.
Spencer’s model suggests that, in any warming period, the loss of energy to outer space starts earlier than the IPCC models consider. Consequently, the total loss of energy to outer space is significantly greater than that projected by the IPCC models. This finding is consistent with the observations. The new model, far simpler than the ones used by the IPCC, better explains the warming or lack thereof during the period of 2000 to 2011, than the IPCC models.
The model explanations are not definitive and are open to interpretation and testing. But they suggest there are far more powerful natural influences on temperature than human CO2 emissions and other variables considered by the IPCC and its models.
Of course, the global warming community re-acted as may be expected. Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report (AR4), declared “I cannot believe it got published!” Spencer’s retort on his blog is worth noting. Please see the press release, Article # 4, and the referenced articles under “Models v. Observations.”

If the “question cannot be answered using observations alone”, how can it be stated that “When compared to the available observations, the model describes the ocean temperature rise and variability well”? This is a circular argument. Models themselves are hypotheses, and the more accurate statement by the authors would be that the available observations do not falsify the model as replicating reality.

"Earth Day demonstrations scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic are being replaced with digital activism via the online gaming community to exploit an as yet untapped audience for action against climate change. Earth Day, 22 April 2020, had been years in the planning but the large global demonstrations to mark the event’s 50th anniversary were brought to a halt by Covid-19. In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere.  In an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change. This week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a “green” tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a “farm” in its challenges. Jillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: “We had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about. “This is the first time we have reached out through the gaming world. Measuring success is always challenging, but what we hope is that these additional games will allow people to see that what we produce, what we consume and what we waste has an impact. “If this translates, once the lockdowns are over, into people going out and engaging more with the environment, in beach cleans, reducing waste, that is the connection we want to make.” Players of Solitaire Grand Harvest this week are greeted with the introduction: “As y’all know, our farm is full of different landscapes, just like the planet we live on. So, in honor of the International Earth Day we’ve decided to pay homage to mother nature with some special challenges, unique surprises, and HUGE rewards – all related to environmental protection and recycling.” Yuval Dor, owner of Solitaire Grand Harvest, said: “I think games are a fantastic way to deliver serious messages but in a fun way, without the feeling that you are been lectured. “In a time like this when gathering is not allowed, and many of the physical activities that usually take place are impossible, digital spaces are more relevant than ever to convince people to take action ... completing virtual missions like cleaning beaches, replanting forests and recycling competition will engage our players in a fun way, to the importance of giving back to the planet and take action, even remotely. “"

You either believe in democracy or you don’t. If you do you will accept that lobbying is an essential ingredient in the mix of factors that ensure a robust democracy. It may be that on some issues lobbying is akin to the proverbial “pushing water uphill into a headwind”, but that should never be an excuse for not participating in the process. 



The **Zero Carbon Bill** is at Select Committee and is open for submissions. They close on the 16th of July – just a few days away.



Oilers need to act.



NZIER has done some modelling (largely all based on just one paper published in 2018) that **shows massive negative impacts on our economy.** Implementing the Bill could lead to a disastrous $100 billion fall in GDP by 2050, impacting severely on the poorest people in the economy. 



It foresees a drop in exports, a 140% increase in trees (note log prices are down dramatically as northern hemisphere spruce has become available to the Chinese), and huge increases in energy prices; household incomes will be down, unemployment will increase, real wages will fall substantially and much more.



The modelling suggests that the negative effects do not change much whether the rest of the world takes strong or weak climate change action.



It then says it cannot predict what might happen if all the claims of catastrophic weather were to occur. It is silent on what might happen if no catastrophic events occur – the most likely scenario given that there have been no adverse effects from the first degree of warming. 



So we pull our pants down and take a huge hit. The rest of the world does nothing or little and there are no major weather effects so they remain in good shape. Our competitiveness is shot to pieces. Greece will look like a paradise compared to our position. It’s a bizarre outlook. No other single piece of legislation in our history will have such a dramatic and damaging effect.



 **What can Oilers do? What should Oilers do?**



Go to <https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/52SCEN_SCF_BILL_87861/climate-change-response-zero-carbon-amendment-bill> and follow instructions.



What to say?



A) Public policy involving projected massive damage to the New Zealand economy should not be made on the basis of climate models that are problematic. Even the strongest advocates of the accuracy of the models admit they are not accurate e.g. Dr Gavin Schmidt, IPCC reports, etc



Highly acclaimed scientists like Judith Curry, Roger Pielke, John Christy and Roy Spencer have produced well-researched papers pointing out the serious divergence between predictions of temperature rise and actual and why they have occurred.



B) Temperatures have risen by 0.7 to 1.0 degree C in the last 50 – 70 years depending on location, recording methods, timing, start dates etc. There is no evidence that this temperature rise has had any detrimental effects on the weather. Why should another degree cause “catastrophic” conditions?



C) Almost all record of weather events since so-called warming began, show positive gains, improvements and fewer catastrophes. 



D) Increases in CO2 have been highly beneficial to the world’s vegetation and crop outputs, helping combat hunger.



E) If New Zealand, which produces less than 0.2% of the world’s so-called man made CO2 emissions, takes drastic action and few other countries do, the detriment will be hugely exacerbated. We will become even more uncompetitive as exporters in world markets that we are reliant on more than most other countries.



F) The work output of the IPCC is largely political rather than scientific. Its very raison d’etre was not to investigate climate changes in an unbiased manner but to prove the existing meme. Funds have been made available to scientists who shout the loudest about problems arising from warming – even bizarre claims totally unrelated to weather or climate, while scientists wanting to offer theories and ideas in opposition have been closed down, under-funded, derided, squeezed out of their jobs etc. 



G) Multiple claims made over the last 50 years have not been validated. Polar bears extinct, arctic ice disappearing, falling food production, climate refugees in NZ, no more snow, etc.

With President Obama’s repeated attempts to draw distinctions between himself from his predecessor—and a widespread belief that he and Bush are polar opposites in nearly every way—it’s actually startling how similar the two men are. And if the policies match the rhetoric, it’s going to be another very long 4–8 years filled with ever more government intrusion and red ink.   




“In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another — and I will do my part. Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2006 SOTU 



“Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources. And we are on the threshold of incredible advances. So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative — a 22‐​percent increase in clean‐​energy research — at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero‐​emission coal‐​fired plants, revolutionary solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2006 SOTU 



“I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home. I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70‐​percent cut in air pollution from powerplants over the next 15 years.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2003 SOTU 



“Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. Our Government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. For all Americans, we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor‐​patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2006 SOTU 



“In 2 weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent. This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people’s money. By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2004 SOTU



“My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. The principle here is clear: a taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely, or not at all.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2005 SOTU 



“The people’s trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I’ll send it back to you with my veto. And tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal Agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote.”   
  
  
  
–George W. Bush, 2008 SOTU

Today’s crybaby of the week would have to be Crim Hugger, Climate Logic Denier and ‘Premium’ (lol) content supplier to _A Newspaper_ , Jarrod Gilbert.



Quite how _A Newspaper_ could deem this week’s pathetic diatribe from Gilbert as premium content that one should pay for is beyond me, but since their paywall is about as holey as a Swiss cheese resting on a sponge in the Vatican, as a service to all you good folk out there, I sacrificed two minutes of my life and had a read.



“Just FYI, if you recline your seat on a plane, you are an ass. If you recline your seat on a plane and don’t think you’re an ass, read this tweet again.” 



  
Mr Gilbert being a Climate Alarmist, I’m not sure what he was doing on a plane, given that they are the primary cause of skinny polar bears – but I digress.



I won’t bore you with all of the sordid details but you can take it as read that…



And perhaps I should add, 4. Mr Gilbert is a cheapskate, given that all you have to do on a local flight around New Zealand would be to pay $10 to upgrade to exit row 12 on the 737s which not only has heaps of legroom but also is behind row 11 which, also being an exit row, cannot recline! But even better, row 12 seats can recline themselves so if he chose to be a Ass himself, he could flick his own seat back as hypocrites are wont to do.



And if Mr Gilbert is a frequent flier of sufficient import, he would be allowed to sit up near the front of the plane where there is much better legroom anyway. 



Although surely there is no such thing as a Greenie with a Gold Status; I can’t imagine there would be any such hypocritical people on this fragile planet.



So anyway, it’s time to front up. Let’s have a wee poll.



Are you an Ass, who reclines, or an Asshat, who hates those guys? I’ll start, put me down as an Ass.

By WUWT regular “Just The Facts”
I am often amused by claims that we understand Earth’s climate system, are able to accurately measure its behavior, eliminate all potential variables except CO2 as the primary driver of Earth’s temperature and make predictions of Earth’s temperature decades into the future, all with a high degree of confidence. I have been studying Earth’s climate system for several years and have found it to be a ridiculously complex, continually evolving and sometimes chaotic beast. Furthermore, our understanding of Earth’s climate system is currently rudimentary at best, our measurement capabilities are limited and our historical record is laughably brief. To help demonstrate the complexity of Earth’s climate system I have been compiling a list of all of the variables potentially involved in Earth’s climate system. This is a work in progress so additions, recommendations, corrections, questions etc. are most welcome. Once I develop this further and polish it up a bit I plan to convert it into a new WUWT Reference Page.
UPDATED: This list has undergone significant revisions and improvements based upon crowdsourcing the input of an array of very intelligent and knowledgeable contributors below. Additionally, this list was posted in comments in WUWT a few times previously, receiving input from a number of other very intelligent and knowledgeable contributors. This thread, along with links to the precursor threads below, will thus serve as the bibliography for the forthcoming WUWT Potential Climatic Variables reference page (unless someone can up with a better name for it…:)

“The presence of the moon (which has about 1/81 the mass of the Earth), is slowing Earth’s rotation and lengthening the day by about 2 ms every one hundred years.”
“However some large scale events, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, have caused the rotation to speed up by around 3 microseconds.[21] Post-glacial rebound, ongoing since the last Ice age, is changing the distribution of the Earth’s mass thus affecting the Moment of Inertia of the Earth and, by the Conservation of Angular Momentum, the Earth’s rotation period.”

Earth’s gravity is the primary driver of Plate Tectonics;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics
“The Slab Pull;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_pull

force accounts for 5 to 10% of the overall force.”

has been hypothesized to influence Earth’s climate;
http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/04/05/courtillot-on-the-solar-uv-climate-connection/
however Leif Svalgaard argues that,
This is well-trodden ground. Nothing new to add, just the same old, tired arguments. Perhaps a note on EUV: as you can see here (slide 13)
http://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/news/2008ScienceMeeting/doc/Session1/S1_03_Kopp.pdf the energy in the EUV band [and other UV bands] is very tiny; many orders of magnitude less than what shines down on our heads each day. So a larger solar cycle variation of EUV does not make any significant difference in the energy budget.

Leif Svalgaard says: February 6, 2011 at 8:26 pm
If L&P are correct and sunspots become effectively] invisible [not gone] it might mean another Grand Minimum lasting perhaps 50 years. During this time the solar cycle is still operating, cosmic rays are still modulated, and the solar wind is still buffeting the Earth.”
“It will lead to a cooling of a couple of tenths of a degree.”

for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapir
from the core-mantle boundary, 3,000 km deep in the Earth.”
Volcanoes have been shown to influence Earth’s climate;
http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/climate_effects.html
http://www.longrangeweather.com/global_temperatures.htm
including in the infamous Year Without a Summer;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer
which was partially caused by the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora
and is called a Volcanic Winter:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter
“Volcanic Ash;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash
particles have a maximum residence time in the troposphere of a few weeks.
The finest Tephera;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra
remain in the stratosphere for only a few months, they have only minor climatic effects, and they can be spread around the world by high-altitude winds. This suspended material contributes to spectacular sunsets.
“The greatest volcanic impact upon the earth’s short term weather patterns is caused by sulfur dioxide gas;”
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide
“In the cold lower atmosphere, it is converted to Sulfuric Acid;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid
sulfuric acid by the sun’s rays reacting with stratospheric water vapor to form sulfuric acid aerosol layers. The aerosol remains in suspension long after solid ash particles have fallen to earth and forms a layer of sulfuric acid droplets between 15 to 25 kilometers up. Fine ash particles from an eruption column fall out too quickly to significantly cool the atmosphere over an extended period of time, no matter how large the eruption.
Sulfur aerosols last many years, and several historic eruptions show a good correlation of sulfur dioxide layers in the atmosphere with a decrease in average temperature decrease of subsequent years. The close correlation was first established after the 1963 eruption of Agung volcano in Indonesia when it was found that sulfur dioxide reached the stratosphere and stayed as a sulfuric acid aerosol.
Without replenishment, the sulfuric acid aerosol layer around the earth is gradually depleted, but it is renewed by each eruption rich in sulfur dioxide. This was confirmed by data collected after the eruptions of El Chichon, Mexico (1982) and Pinatubo, Philippines (1991), both of which were high-sulfur compound carriers like Agung, Indonesia.”
http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/gas.htm
There is also some evidence that if “volcanic activity was high enough, then a water vapor anomaly would be introduced into the lower stratosphere before the anomaly due to the previous eruption had disappeared. The result would be threefold in the long term: stratospheric cooling, stratospheric humidification, and surface warming due to the positive radiative forcing associated with the water vapor.”

The major climate influence from volcanic eruptions is caused by gaseous sulfur compounds, chiefly Sulfur Dioxide;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide
which reacts with OH and water in the stratosphere to create sulfate aerosols with a residence time of about 2–3 years.”
“Emission rates of [Sulfur Dioxide] SO2 from an active volcano range from 10 million tonnes/day according to the style of volcanic activity and type and volume of magma involved. For example, the large explosive eruption of Mount Pinatubo on 15 June 1991 expelled 3-5 km3 of dacite magma and injected about 20 million metric tons of SO2 into the stratosphere. The sulfur aerosols resulted in a 0.5-0.6°C cooling of the Earth’s surface in the Northern Hemisphere.”
http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/index.php
“The 1815 eruption [of Mount Tambora] is rated 7 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, the only such eruption since the Lake Taupo eruption in about 180 AD. With an estimated ejecta volume of 160 cubic kilometers, Tambora’s 1815 outburst was the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history.”
“The eruption created global climate anomalies that included the phenomenon known as “volcanic winter”;
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter
1816 became known as the “Year Without a Summer”;
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer
because of the effect on North American and European weather. Agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in the worst famine of the 19th century.”

“In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent “dry fog” was observed in the northeastern US. The fog reddened and dimmed the sunlight, such that sunspots were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the “fog”. It has been characterized as a stratospheric sulfate aerosol veil.”

University of Toronto Mississauga professor wins Ig Nobel Prize for beer, sex research

It was a case of a besotted male and beer. Love-sick and lonely, the male girded his loins and took immediate action to relieve his unhappiness – but with a surprising outcome, as a U of T Mississauga professor discovered.
The male in question, an Australian jewel beetle (Julodimorpha bakewelli), became so enamored with a brown “stubby” beer bottle that he tried to mate with it – so vigorously that he died trying to copulate in the hot sun rather than leave willingly, says Professor Darryl Gwynne of biology, an international expert in behavioural ecology, specifically the evolution of reproductive behaviour. 
Today, Gwynne and his Australian colleague David Rentz were awarded an Ig Nobel Prize at Harvard University for their 1983 paper “Beetles on the Bottle: Male Buprestids Mistake Stubbies for Females.” The Ig Nobel Prizes, a parody of the Nobel Prizes, are awarded annually by the scientific humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research to “first make people laugh and then make them think.” The prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honour the imaginative and spur people’s interest in science, medicine and technology.
“I’m honoured, I think,” Gwynne says, with a smile on his face. “The awards make people think, and they’re a bit of a laugh. Really, we’ve been sitting here by the phone for the past 20 plus years waiting for the call. Why did it take them so long?”
Gwynne and Rentz were conducting field work in Western Australia 23 years ago when they noticed something unusual along the side of the road. “We were walking along a dirt road with the usual scattering of beer cans and bottles when we saw about six bottles with beetles on top or crawling up the side. It was clear the beetles were trying to mate with the bottles.”
The bottles – stubbies as they are known in Australia – resemble a “super female” jewel beetle, Gwynne says: big and orangey brown in colour, with a slightly dimpled surface near the bottom (designed to prevent the bottle from slipping out of one’s grasp) that reflects light in much the same way as female wing covers. The bottles proved irresistible to males. Ignoring the females, the males mounted or tried to climb up the bottles, refusing to leave. They fried to death in the sun, were eaten by hungry ants or had to be physically removed by the researchers.
Gwynne and Rentz determined that the males were attracted only to stubbies – not to beer cans or wine bottles of a slightly different shade of brown. And it wasn’t the bottles’ contents that captured their attention: “Not only do western Australians never dispose of a beer bottle with beer still in it, but many of the bottles had sand and detritus accumulated over many months,” the research paper notes.
Beer and sex humour aside, the research has serious messages, Gwynne says. First, when humans interfere – perhaps unwittingly – in an evolutionary process, there can be unintended consequences; in this case, female beetles are ignored by males which can have a huge impact on the natural world. “Improperly disposed of beer bottles not only present a physical and ‘visual’ hazard in the environment, but also could potentially cause great interference with the mating system of a beetle species,” the paper says. To that end, Gwynne forwarded research results to a leading western Australian brewer.
And secondly, Gwynne points out that the research supports the theory of sexual selection: that males, in their eagerness to mate, are the ones that make mating mistakes.
Gwynne conducted his research as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Western Australia in Nedlands. He joined U of T Mississauga in 1987. The research was published in the journal of the Entomological Society of Australia and the U.K.-based journal, Antenna.

"The ineffective burning of wood in traditional stoves means that more people die around the world from pollution indoors than outdoors. There are simple, cleaner alternatives for sale, but encouraging the purchase of them has proved difficult. A project in India, however, is using rural women’s social networks to successfully change the situation and those selling improved stoves can learn from that project. A recent report from the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates around 4.3m deaths globally in 2012 due to indoor air pollution and almost all of them in low and middle income countries. In comparison, outdoor air pollution led to 2.6m deaths.  The WHO report believes that nearly three billion poor people, who rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, are at risk of being affected by indoor pollution. Nearly 50% deaths among children under five in underdeveloped countries are the result of acute lower respiratory infections caused by indoor pollution in the form of carbon monoxide and particulate matter generated by burning biomass. Such biomass is the cheapest and most widely available fuel. Continuous exposure to such indoor pollution can lead to other health problems. Women – who spend more time near stoves – are particularly badly affected. One solution to changing this is to use improved stoves. In most countries, these are available from governments and charities. Some provide them for free, but most places offer it at subsidised prices.  Improved stoves come in different designs, but the main idea is to ensure that the fuel is burned effectively, so that it does not create soot or toxic carbon monoxide. This is achieved by improving airflow near the site where the fuel is burnt. Some designs allow the removal of gases released from the burning fuel away from the person sitting near the stove. The health benefits are usually long term, so people don’t always opt for the purchase even at subsidised rates. Even when they are provided for free, a lot of the people quickly stop using them.  The Indian government’s National Program on Improved Cookstoves is a good example of the kind of government-led stove interventions that can go wrong. Although there was money available for the program, it failed because of poor stove design, misunderstanding of the community’s needs and poor distribution networks. NGOs do better, but often don’t have enough financial support. Project Shakti, a programme launched by Hindustan Unilever, has found a way to use women’s social networks to bring about behaviour change and drive communities to adopt new products. Important insights can be drawn through this case and can be applied for sustained dissemination of improved cookstoves among such poor communities. The project recruits influential women in rural communities who are called Shakti Ammas, where Shakti means “power” and Amma means “mother”. These Shakti Ammas have strong social network partnership with the other women in their communities. While earning a living from this programme, these Shakti Ammas influence the opinions of the peers in their networks.  In a country with the largest informal labour market, women often don’t find decent wages for their work. That is why even a small income can be a good driver. In this case, the influence leads to the purchase of Hindustan Unilever’s products, such as washing powders, soaps, shampoos or toothpastes, among the rural women in their networks. But there is much to learn from this marketing strategy to help other not-for-profit ideas to spread. Penetrating the rural market in India has remained a big challenge because that population tends not to consume media and advertising in the way that  urban folks do. But Project Shakti has been successful where most have failed. The strategy has been so effective that by 2013, more than 40,000 Shakti Ammas are working in 15 Indian states and these informal networks are changing behaviour in more than 100,000 villages. Project Shakti provides two important insights for an effective dissemination of ideas and products. First, the influence of the group leader in informal community based networks has a marked prominence in dissemination of new products. Second, influential women within these social networks can become powerful agents to change traditions, culture, and social norms and can facilitate the uptake of new, cleaner products. These insights and cases such as Project Shakti are highly relevant to research studies focusing on the dissemination of improved cookstoves and eventually for causing a behavioural change among the rural communities to sustainably use these improved stoves.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you on Saturday morning.**
The coronavirus R number has fallen to between 0.9 and 1 in the UK for the first time since mid-August. The estimate from the government's scientific advisers suggests the epidemic is no longer growing and could even be falling. However, cases in some regions of England are still high, particularly the North West, the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. It comes as England prepares to leave lockdown on 2 December and enter a revised system of tiered restrictions. You can read about what the R number is and why it's important here and check for case numbers in your area here.
The prime minister has defended the government's decision to place 55 million people in England into the two highest levels of Covid restrictions amid unrest from some MPs in his own party. Boris Johnson said the measures were more ""relaxed"" than the lockdown and would ""drive"" infection rates down until a vaccine is available. But the Covid Recovery Group of Conservative MPs, which claims to have 70 members, is threatening a revolt in next Tuesday's Commons vote on the plans. It raises the possibility of the government requiring Labour votes to get the measures approved. Here we answer some of your questions about what happens when the lockdown ends, and here we cover the rules in each tier.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia is understood to be on the brink of collapse, placing 13,000 jobs at risk. The firm, whose brands include Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, said the pandemic ""has had a material impact on trading across our businesses"". It had been in talks with potential lenders about borrowing Â£30m to help the business through Christmas. But these have failed and administrators could be appointed on Monday. Read here about what went wrong at Arcadia's flagship brand Topshop.
The Christmas school holidays could be extended in Scotland, it has emerged. Discussions have been taking place about standardising dates across the country, so that all schools close on 18 December and reopen on 11 January. While most schools are set to close on 18 December, others are due to be open until 23 December, with the majority planning to return between 5 and 7 January. A memo, leaked to the Daily Record, says that extending the holidays would act as a break following the relaxation of Covid rules over the festive period.
The landlords of two pubs that are in the same village and are just 0.4 miles apart have described the Covid tiers as ""perplexing"" after learning that one can reopen next week while the other has to stay shut. Groombridge sits on the border of East Sussex and Kent, which will enter tiers two and three respectively next week. Because the Junction is in East Sussex it can reopen, while the Crown Inn in Kent will remain closed. Steve Harmes, at the Crown, said it was ""horrendous"" while the Junction's Tiffany Pearson-Gills called it ""perplexing"".

Fossilized pollen reveals climate history of northern Antarctica
Analysis of direct climate record shows Antarctic tundra persisted until 12 million years ago
HOUSTON — (June 27, 2011) — A painstaking examination of the first direct and detailed climate record from the continental shelves surrounding Antarctica reveals that the last remnant of Antarctic vegetation existed in a tundra landscape on the continent’s northern peninsula about 12 million years ago. The research, which was led by researchers at Rice University and Louisiana State University, appears online this week and will be featured on the cover of the July 12 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The new study contains the most detailed reconstruction to date of the climatic history of the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed significantly in recent decades. The rapid decline of glaciers along the peninsula has led to widespread speculation about how the rest of the continent’s ice sheets will react to rising global temperatures.

“The best way to predict future changes in the behavior of Antarctic ice sheets and their influence on climate is to understand their past,” said Rice University marine geologist John Anderson, the study’s lead author. The study paints the most detailed picture to date of how the Antarctic Peninsula first succumbed to ice during a prolonged period of global cooling.
In the warmest period in Earth’s past 55 million years, Antarctica was ice-free and forested. The continent’s vast ice sheets, which today contain more than two-thirds of Earth’s freshwater, began forming about 38 million years ago. The Antarctic Peninsula, which juts farther north than the rest of the continent, was the last part of Antarctica to succumb to ice. It’s also the part that has experienced the most dramatic warming in recent decades; its mean annual temperatures rose as much as six times faster than mean annual temperatures worldwide.

“There’s a longstanding debate about how rapidly glaciation progressed in Antarctica,” said Sophie Warny, a Louisiana State University geologist who specializes in palynology (the study of fossilized pollen and spores) and led the palynological reconstruction. “We found that the fossil record was unambiguous; glacial expansion in the Antarctic Peninsula was a long, gradual process that was influenced by atmospheric, tectonic and oceanographic changes.”
Warny, her students and colleague Rosemary Askin were able to ascertain the exact species of plants that existed on the peninsula over the past 36 million years after a painstaking, three-year examination of thousands of individual grains of pollen that were preserved in muddy sediments beneath the sea floor just off the coast.
“The pollen record in the sedimentary layers was beautiful, both in its richness and depth,” Warny said. “It allowed us to construct a detailed picture of the rapid decline of the forests during the late Eocene — about 35 million years ago — and the widespread glaciation that took place in the middle Miocene — about 13 million years ago.”
Obtaining the sedimentary samples wasn’t easy. The muddy treasure trove was locked away beneath almost 100 feet of dense sedimentary rock. It was also off the coast of the peninsula in shallow waters that are covered by ice most of the year and beset by icebergs the rest. Anderson, a veteran of more than 25 research expeditions to Antarctica, and colleagues spent more than a decade building a case for the funding to outfit an icebreaker with the right kind of drilling equipment to bore through the rock.

In 2002, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the project, which was dubbed SHALDRIL. Three years later, the NSF research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer left on the first of two drilling cruises.
“It was the worst ice year that any of us could remember,” Anderson said. “We’d spend most of a day lowering drill string to the ocean floor only to pull it back up to get out of the way of approaching icebergs.”
The next year was little better, but the SHALDRIL team managed to obtain enough core samples to cover the past 36 million years, thanks to the logistical planning of marine geologist Julia Wellner and to the skill of the drilling crew. By end of the second season, Anderson said, the crew could drill as much as a meter every five minutes.
Reconstructing a detailed climate record from the sample was another Herculean task. In addition to the three-year palynological analysis at LSU, University of Southampton palaeoceanographer Steven Bohaty led an effort to nail down the precise age of the various sediments in each core sample. Wellner, now at the University of Houston, examined the characteristics of the sediments to determine whether they formed below an ice sheet, in open marine conditions or in a combined glacial-marine setting. Other members of the team had to count, categorize and even examine the surface texture of thousands of sand grains that were preserved in the sediments. Gradually, the team was able to piece together a history of how much of the peninsula was covered by glaciers throughout the past 36 million years.
“SHALDRIL gave us the first reliable age constraints on the timing of ice sheet advance across the northern peninsula,” Anderson said. “The rich mosaic of organic and geologic material that we found in the sedimentary record has given us a much clearer picture of the climatic history of the Antarctic Peninsula. This type of record is invaluable as we struggle to place in context the rapid changes that we see taking place in the peninsula today.”

The study was funded by grants from the NSF’s Office of Polar Programs to Anderson and Warny. Study co-authors include Wellner; Askin; Bohaty; Alexandra Kirshner, Tyler Smith and Fred Weaver, all of Rice; Alexander Simms and Daniel Livsey, both of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Werner Ehrmann of the University of Leipzig; Lawrence Lawver of the University of Texas at Austin; David Barbeau of the University of South Carolina; Sherwood Wise and Denise Kulhenek, both of Florida State University; and Wojciech Majewski of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

"**Drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions will have to leave when they finish eating, under new restrictions being introduced from 2 December, No 10 has confirmed.**
Under the post-lockdown guidance, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant.
And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"".
Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways.
The prime minister's official spokesman, asked how long drinkers can stay in a pub after buying a meal, said: ""We've been clear that, in tier two I believe, that you need to have a substantial meal if ordering any alcohol and it remains the case that the guidance says that once the meal is finished, it is at that point [you have to leave].""
When the current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live.
In tier two regions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier.
You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to.
In tier three, very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services.
In tier one, medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six. Most of England is in tier two or three, however, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one.
Stricter measures for pubs, restaurants and bars will come into force in Wales on 4 December, it was announced on Friday.
Northern Ireland is currently in a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, with cafes, coffee shops, pubs, bars and restaurants closed, except for takeaways and deliveries. And in Scotland, the rules on pubs and restaurants depend where your region is placed in the four-tier system."

President Obama’s risky perseverance on health care is running over another of his pet government expansions—the cap‐​and‐​trade bill sent by the House on June 26 for Senate consideration. Recall that cap‐​and‐​trade is complex legislation with a very simple premise: make energy so expensive to consume that Americans use less of it, and “greenhouse gas” emissions are thereby curtailed.



But even though it’s now clear the bill is not getting out of Congress, look for the Obama Administration to saddle our economy with this huge new energy tax through other means.



First, a brief flashback: The blowback against Obamunism began over global warming, not health care. By a squeaky 219–212 vote, the House rushed the 1,300-page cap‐​and‐​trade opus out the door so the members could get back to the hustings for the Fourth of July. When many freshman Democrats got home, those who voted for it experienced the first angry town halls of their careers. In our minds, it is easy to remember that the rancorous public meetings that continued in the August recess were always about health care, but they weren’t.





The bottom line is that Senate Democrats are perfectly happy to kick cap‐​and‐​trade under the bus.



So, given that health care is now effectively bottled up in both chambers of Congress, why isn’t Obama pushing cap‐​and‐​trade in the Senate? Simple: the votes aren’t there for it. Blanche Lincoln, the new head of the Agriculture Committee, calls cap‐​and‐​trade a “complete non starter” and said that it is not her “preference to move on cap and trade this year.” Majority Leader Harry Reid recently signaled his agreement by stating that cap‐​and‐​trade “may” not be considered until next year.



For cap‐​and‐​trade, “next year” translates as “never.” Senators know what touched off the town halls, and they know what fate awaits many of their Democratic colleagues come November 2010. Passing an unpopular health care “public option” along with cap‐​and‐​trade will easily realign the Senate into its old filibustering self. That kills cap‐​and‐​trade in the next Congress.



But do not despair, fans of economy‐​killing regulation.



Thanks to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (2007), the EPA has authority to issue its own regulations on carbon dioxide. So while asking legislators to swallow hard on the bitter gristle of cap‐​and‐​trade, the president has really had the power to enact its core components on his own all along. Small wonder lawmakers of his own party are more than willing to toss the issue back onto his plate.



Now that cap‐​and‐​trade has so spectacularly failed in the legislature, it is a sure bet that Obama will direct (or has directed) EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to issue her own cap‐​and‐​trade protocols. Look for something concrete out of EPA before the U.N.‘s climate change confab in Copenhagen in early December. (That “something” may even include a new fuel economy standard of 35.5 miles-per-gallon—though it would be lower, of course, for the inefficient cars produced by government‐​owned General Motors.)



The timing of the Copenhagen conference is really what has been driving Obama’s support for cap‐​and‐​trade all along. It would be an embarrassment for a left‐​hewing “green” president to show up empty‐​handed at such an event—and it will greatly diminish Obama’s ability to wag his finger at other industrialized countries. For sure, the world’s largest emitter of CO2—China—isn’t going to agree to any mandatory emissions reductions unless the U.S. has something very serious in hand. And if China does nothing, there’s simply not going to be a major slowdown in the growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases.



Not that it really matters. The rather large elephants crowding cap‐​and‐​trade out of the Senate is the earth’s reluctance to warm in the last decade along with new projections saying that we could go another ten years without much warming.



The current hiatus in warming portends a reduction in potential heating for the entire century. Most computer models produce significant warming as a result of an increase in atmospheric water vapor (a “greenhouse” gas), which comes from an ocean initially warmed by carbon dioxide. When the ocean doesn’t warm much, this “feedback” effect is delayed. Or so goes the myth.



The lack of warming is an embarrassment to any elected official who has been hiding behind “the science is settled” fig leaf in order to promote cap‐​and‐​trade. While every scientist will tell you that indeed the surface temperature of the planet is warmer than it was a century ago (that’s the “settled” part of global warming science), very few scientists anticipated as long a period without warming as we are in. In other words, the real science of future warming is completely unsettled. 



The bottom line is that Senate Democrats are perfectly happy to kick cap‐​and‐​trade under the bus. They’re going to have a hard enough time recovering from the upcoming health care wreck. But the economy, meanwhile, will have an equally hard time recovering from what President Obama is going to do instead.

"**Food parcels are still being handed out to about 150 people by a charity months after the country's first lockdown.**
Bedfordshire-based Social Education Voluntary Association (SEVA) Trust UK said it had worked ""without a break"" since Covid restrictions in March.
Jenny Woods, 73, a Bedford widow who has received parcels, said you should never be ""too proud or independent"" to ask for help.
The group is supporting families, rough sleepers and international students.
Charan Sekhon, the Sharnbrook-based charity's chairman, said: ""We are not an emergency response or food support charity. In light of Covid-19 and serious impacts on our local communities and overseas students, we decided to help our communities.
""We are trying our best to operate as per seva, meaning selfless service in Punjabi and Hindi, principles given by the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak, who started the concept of langer, meaning free food for the needy.""
He said the charity started in 2016 and is currently helping 50 families or individuals, 45 homeless people, all in Bedford, and international students across the country.
It has also helped more than 1,000 people and students in India since the pandemic started.
**Other Bedfordshire stories you may be interested in:**
Susan, from Bedford who only wanted to be known by her first name, is a single mother with children, aged 11 and 13.
She has received food hampers from the group since the first lockdown.
""When I first used them I felt embarrassed, but after speaking to family and friends, I knew it was OK to ask for help,"" she said.
""If someone offers you help - take it.""
Mrs Woods said she was ""very grateful"" for all the help she had been given, from food to regular phone calls.
""I think I'm of an age that thinks it's not what you do [asking for help], as there is this feeling of being proud and independent,"" she said.
""If they are kind enough to help, it would be rude not to accept it.""

"The significant retreat of elements of the West Antarctic ice sheet such as the Thwaites glacier recently reported in the journal Science suggests a possible sea level rise of 3 to 3.7m. This is a huge increase in sea level that cannot fail to affect us all. With so much of the world’s population living in low-lying cities, it seems more important now than ever that we’re able to make accurate predictions of sea level change. However, to do this we need to know not only how much ice is being lost from Antarctica and other frozen regions, but how the Earth’s surface deforms in response to that loss.  The trillions of tonnes of ice locked in ice sheets weighs heavily on the bedrock underneath it. As the mass of ice grows and shrinks, over geological time the Earth is compressed by the weight, or springs back as it melts, which in turn displaces more or less of the oceans and affects the extent of sea level rise. This is tricky to calculate because the Earth deforms in two ways. There is an instantaneous elastic rebound of the crust, like a spring bouncing back after a weight has been taken off. This is followed by a very slow uplift due to movement of the mantle, the layer of semi-molten rock underlying the roughly 100 mile-thick hard outer crust.  Although we think of the mantle as rock, it flows like a highly viscous fluid when subject to changes in surface load. This typically occurs over many thousands of years, but the timescale depends on the viscosity of the mantle and how easily it can flow. As it is many miles below the surface and exists at temperatures of up to 1,000°C, we cannot directly measure its properties – so we have to infer them indirectly. Our recent study of the Northern Antarctic Peninsula published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters was a sort of fast-forward version of this problem. The mantle in this region is commonly thought to be less viscous and more mobile than in other parts of Antarctica. This means that it responds much more quickly to changes in pressure as ice is unloaded at the surface. We combined records of the significant loss of ice that has taken place here in the past ten to 15 years with GPS measurements of the Earth’s rebounding motion to unravel this problem on a regional scale. Over the past few decades, several ice shelves at the very tip of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed, with the result that glaciers flowing into where the shelves once were now deliver more ice into the sea. Satellites record the glaciers’ elevation frequently, so scientists can determine the rate of thinning and how much ice is lost from the land into the sea. GPS transmitting stations fixed to the Antarctic bedrock record deformation of the Earth – and several sites have been installed in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula to measure the rebounding due to ice loss in this area. What we have discovered from this data is how quickly the Earth is moving 250 miles below the surface. The instantaneous elastic rebound expected from the ice loss did not tally with the GPS records, leaving an unexplained and rapid rise of up to 15mm per year. This means that the remaining rebound has to come from the flow of the mantle pushing underneath.  We used the measurements to determine that the mantle viscosity had to be around ten times lower than previously thought for this region – and consequently has responded much more quickly to the lightening load at surface level – in scales of years rather than centuries. We can almost see it happening and being able to take accurate GPS measurements is incredibly useful. It also enables us to predict the amount of rebound much closer to the thinning glaciers than our current GPS sites, and based on what we know, this could be as much as 47mm per year. This has really significant implications for the interpretation of GPS records, which are often used to verify models used in the prediction of sea-level rise and for measurements of the Earth’s gravitational field, which are used to detect ongoing changes in the mass of ice sheets. So the glacier retreat reported in West Antarctica will also be driving further, rapid bedrock uplift. This could be as much as 5cm (2 inches) per year, but the historical GPS record in this region is still too short to provide detailed answers. As Antarctic glaciers continue to thin, the unloading of ice will provide an opportunity to probe the Earth in other parts of Antarctica.  While this is fortunate for earth scientists to pursue their interests, given that sea level rise affects everyone it’s not something we really welcome."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust call the Jyllands-Posten’s Sunday feature the “Climate Catastrophe Caricatures”!
By P Gosselin and Arne Garbøl
Huge doubt over claims made by alarmist climate scientists is now spreading to leading Scandinavian publications, the Jyllands-Posten in Denmark for example.

Jyllands-Posten does a highly critical 4-page Sunday edition story on climate alarmism.
Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten print edition last Sunday published a major four-page headline story (see photo above), featuring leading critics of alarmist climate science: renowned IPCC scientist Lennart Bengtsson of Sweden, and others. Hat-tip Sebastian Lüning.
Though Bengtsson believes CO2 is warming the planet somewhat, he says it’s real impact has been grossly exaggerated.
Many of you will recall that the Jyllands-Posten is the daily that famously published the controversial Muhammad caricatures some years back, setting off a firestorm of protest across the Muslim world. Now the Danish daily is setting off a firestorm of protest from the climate alarmism mullahs.
“For too long random extreme weather events have been allowed to shape the climate debate,” writes the Jyllands-Posten (JP). The article tells its readers it’s time to get back to rationality and science. 

What catastrophe?, the Jyllands-Posten is asking with the above chart (Scafetta). The models so far have been completely wrong!
“Tired of media over-dramatizing climate development ”
The JP writes Bengtsson “is angry and disappointed by the spread of so many untruths and lies about the climate, and especially the future climate, and that it is totally spoiling the climate debate. […] and he is really tired of politicians, media, and climate scientists over-dramatizing the climate development and the consequences of more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”
On the rate of warming JP cites Bengtsson: “it is a good deal lower than what IPCC has put forward…totally different from the report the World Bank presented.” This type of reporting by major dailies is not the kind of thing Danes and Europeans are accustomed to reading. Clearly climate science is being seriously challenged in Denmark.

This is not the first time that Bengtsson has been vocal on the topic of climate hyper-ventilation, see here and here. Bengtsson goes so far to say that the IPCC and World Bank reports at times sound like end-of-the-world declarations.
Look at the real data
The JP writes that Bengtsson thinks its completely wrong to use weather events as evidence of climate change, and is asking journalists and politcians “to take a closer look at what is happening in the world’s real climate.” For example: “In Uppsala we have measured temperatures since 1722. Nothing indicates that
climate here is running amok in global warming.” 
The JP then writes that scientists who do not share catastrophic climate views risk being marginalized, citing criticism by Professor Ole Humlum, and that young scientists no longer dare to speak up. “It created an outcry. It’s a little bit ironic that it now appears to be correct,” Humlum says.
In the article Bengtsson is quoted saying that the CO2’s impact is exaggerated. “Climate models showed a faster warming than what we have seen.” Both Ole Humlum and climate scientist PhD Nicola Scafetta of Duke University in North Carolina agree. JP shows a temperature chart from Scafetta comparing projected temperature to observed (see above).
Hysteria is rampant when it comes to the Arctic ice melt
Bengtsson also tells the JP that the significance of the recent Arctic ice melt has been completely blown out of proportion, “We know that there was very little ice in the Arctic in the thirties and the forties.” JP writes that Bengtsson is far from being alone with that view, citing Professor Ola Johannessen, who “agrees that the climate debate is dominated by catastrophic statements, which has nothing to do with reality.” The JP takes a lengthy look at the situation in the Arctic, and shows that nothing really unusual is happening there. It’s likely that many Danes breathed a sigh of relief after reading the Jylland-Posten piece.
Hansen’s scenarios called “nonsense”
The news about Greenland and Antarctica are also hugely over-hyped. JP quotes Bengtsson: “Worrying about Antarctica melting is like worrying about the Earth and Venus colliding within the next billion years, which some models show could happen.” This is an opinion that is also shared by Johannessen, who called James Hansen’s claims “nonsense”:
Once American scientist James Hansen said that Greenland ice would melt within some hundred years, but this is nonsense. If global warming continued, it would take thousands of years.”
No link between warming and greater sea level rise
Lennart Bengtsson also warns against sea level rise alarmism: “The fact is that we can’t see a link between the warming and the increased sea level. The global warming has until now been totally harmless.”
JP also cites leading scientists in the article, assuring that the climate on the planet just doesn’t tip. There are built-in mechanisms to prevent this. History clearly shows this.
The Jyllands-Posten piece represents another major step by important elements of the European media in taking a tougher and more critical look at climate science. Prominent climate scientists are speaking out, and the media is handing them the megaphone.

"Brightening clouds with salt crystals and deploying slicks of coral larvae to try and limit the impacts of global heating on the Great Barrier Reef are among more than 40 concepts being backed by the Australian government in an ambitious $150m research and development program. A two-year feasibility study released by the government on Thursday has reduced about 160 potential ideas to a list of 43 that will be funded for further investigation under the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP).  About $100m for the program comes from $443m of previously announced government funding being administered in a partnership with the not-for-profit Great Barrier Reef Foundation. A further $50m will come from a consortium of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), CSIRO, the University of Queensland, QUT, James Cook University, Southern Cross University and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation said it wanted to raise a further $100m from the private sector, and said research and development providers had committed to matching that with a further $50m to create a potential $300m fund. The world’s biggest coral reef system is under intense pressure from global heating. The summer of 2020 saw the third and widest outbreak of mass coral bleaching in five years. Ocean heating, caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is threatening coral reefs around the globe. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said most tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. Global heating is already at about 1C since the industrial revolution. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said a “global response” was needed to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions. She said: “For the average Australian and the average citizen of the world that cares deeply about the reef, this is our chance to shine and demonstrate that while we know climate change is the number one challenge to our reef, we also know there is much we can do to prepare the reef and put it in the best possible position for it to become as resilient as it needs to be.” The feasibility study, led by AIMS, said: “Even if the world manages to stabilise global warming at 1.5C above the pre-industrial average, mass-bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Critically, the reef’s resilience may already be significantly impaired.” The study added: “In short, we are facing the very real prospect that, within a generation and without concerted action to reduce emissions and help drive adaptation and faster recovery from damage, the Great Barrier Reef as we have known it will cease to exist.” Last week, the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Dr David Wachenfeld, told Guardian Australia that measures to improve the reef’s resilience were needed, but their success was underpinned by “dealing with the climate problem.” Dr Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of AIMS, said the “best and brightest scientists” from across Australia had been brought together to work on the feasibility study. “What we have found is pretty profound. There is real hope for the reef,” he said. “RRAP is all about finding ways to help protect the reef from the effects of future warming and to prevent the kinds of bleaching that we have seen going on and to help damaged reefs recover.” He said the research effort was “at the forefront of any science being done anywhere in the world”. Some methods previously discussed as having potential to lower temperatures on reefs during heat stress events – including using pumps and fans to circulate cooler deeper water onto shallower corals – have been ruled out for further research. But other concepts have been approved for further research in programs that will run over the next five to 10 years. They include: Shading reefs by brightening clouds using nano-sized ocean salt crystals, or creating fog and mist over smaller reef areas Using “micro-bubbles”, ultra-thin natural films and farmed algae to reduce light over smaller areas Stabilising and enhancing damaged reef structures with mesh, frames, concrete shapes and 3D printed forms that could recreate the complexity of natural reefs Dispersing slicks of natural and tank-raised coral larvae onto reefs Breeding corals that are naturally more heat tolerant and then using their larvae in mass dispersal David Mead, the AIMS director of strategic development, who helped coordinate the feasibility study, told Guardian Australia: “The outcome we want is to retain the fundamental resilience of the Great Barrier Reef. “This is to progress a broad range of ideas and some will get eliminated along the way.” On cloud brightening, Mead explained the concept was to spray nano-sized droplets of salt water to increase the reflective capabilities of clouds. While the effect was “subtle” he said over a period of weeks initial modelling suggested it could keep water temperatures below the threshold where corals bleached. “It sounds scary and we need to do a lot of detailed studies on any downstream impacts,” he said. The feasibility study also estimated the annual cost of the 43 different concepts being researched. While the costs seemed high – cloud brightening, for example, would cost an estimated $158m a year – Mead said the benefits were also very large. The study modelled likely benefits from deploying the interventions, which ranged from $10.7bn over 60 years to figures in the hundreds of billions. But the cost benefits from deploying the measures were dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and diminished as temperatures went higher. Hardisty said the study had shown it was “technically feasible to act at scale” but he said “it’s going to be a combination of measures applied at different scales and in different areas that will work together to achieve real success.” He said: “If we can get the science right and intervene on the reef at scale to prevent this kind of damage and build that resilience, then the benefits for Australia environmentally, socially and economically, especially for reef communities, is going to be in the tens of billions of dollars.” Anna Marsden, managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, said the feasibility study had shown that 71% of the Australian public supported large-scale efforts to help reefs adapt."
"**GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January.**
Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date.
Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks.
Separately on Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland.
It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983.
In the latest update about Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, GPs have been asked to identify all patients who are 80 or over on 1 January 2021 and do not reside in a care home to prepare for the roll-out.
A letter sent to GP practices said ""there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement"" of the programme.
The letter, first reported in The Irish News, was issued by the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB).
It advises that patients receiving the vaccine will require ""15 minutes of direct observation"" following the injection.
Leisure centres are among venues proposed for the delivery.
It said GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland ""relying"" on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed.
The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien.
""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien.
""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme.""
Vaccine developers at both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are submitting full data to regulators to apply for emergency approval so that countries can start using these different vaccines to immunise whole populations.
Patients will receive two doses of the vaccine, 28 days apart and it may not possible to administer the vaccine while recipients are in their car, the letter to GPs states.
GPs have been asked to complete their annual flu vaccination programme before the end of December so that their efforts can switch to Covid vaccinations, according to Frances O'Hagan from the British Medical Association (BMA).
Ms O'Hagan, deputy chair of the BMA's Northern Ireland GPs' committee, told BBC News NI it will be an ""absolutely mammoth"" task.
She said the vaccinations were ""new work that we would never have done before, in the middle of our busiest time of year"".
""We would have to see the patients for their first vaccine and then see them again in 21 to 28 days - it is quite a narrow window to get people all back again.
""The other problem is that we are being told there is to be a 15-minute wait for each patient after their vaccine - we still have to socially distance them.""
Ms O'Hagan said she believed the vaccination programme would have to ""go on for quite some time"".
On Friday, BBC News NI reported plans were under way to allow NI's vaccination programme to begin in December.
Health and social care frontline workers are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable.
Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage are provisional.
The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health.
Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public.
The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups."

Matthew 7:5 – Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
As Greenpeace publishes yet another attack on a reputable scientist, (Dr Willie Soon), who happens to disagree with the IPCC, they again ignore the massive funding going into the “green” movement, from corporations including “big oil”, foundations and governments.
Their constant attacks on the integrity of  genuine scientists are classic diversionary tactics to avoid close examination of the millions of dollars going into the Global Warming project. A commentary by David and Amy Ridenour in the Washington Times of June 14th last year, showed the major extent of funding to environmental groups by BP, who were being attacked by those same groups over the oil spill in the Gulf.

BP was also a founding member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, (not the same as the Climate Action Network) contributing substantial funding to the climate-change-related lobbying efforts of the environmental groups within it, which include the Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute.
The new “climate friendly” BP was first promoted by BP CEO, Lord John Browne in 1997, (then Sir John Browne), now on the Climate Change Advisory Board of Deutsche Bank along with Dr Pachauri of the IPCC and Professor John Schellnhuber of the German Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
A report in the Washington Examiner, entitled “Working for Big Green can be a very enriching experience” by Mark Tapscott, showed that the leaders of 15 top Big Green environmental groups are paid more than $300,000 in annual compensation, with a half million dollar plus figure for the top “earner”.
He mentions that Environmental Defense Fund President Frederic Krupp, receives total compensation of $496,174, including $446,072 in salary and $50,102 in other compensation.
Close behind Krupp among Big Green environmental movement executives is World Wildlife Fund- US President Carter Roberts, who was paid $486,394, including a salary of $439,327 and other compensation of $47,067.
Krupp and Roberts are particularly interesting because EDF and WWF-US both receive funding from the Grantham Foundation and both are on the joint management board of Jeremy Grantham’s climate institutes at the London School of Economics, (LSE), and Imperial College, London.
Jeremy Grantham is the chairman and co-founder of GMO, a $140 billion global investment management company based in Boston with offices in London, San Francisco, Singapore, Sydney and Zurich.
His first excursion into climate funding in the UK was “The Grantham Institute for Climate Change” set up with £12 million, (~$19million) at Imperial College, London in 2007. The chairman of the LSE Grantham Institute, Lord Stern of the infamous Stern Review, is heavily involved in carbon trading via carbon ratings agency, Idea Carbon. He joined IdeaGlobal, the parent company in 2007, as Vice Chairman. He also advises HSBC on carbon trading.
Environmental Defense boast on their website of their influence on policy in Washington and how they get around the law on lobbying caps: http://www.edf.org/article.cfm?contentID=8943
“EDF has long been a powerful voice in Washington, and when the need began to exceed the $1 million annual cap on our lobbying established by tax law, we created a sister group, the Environmental Defense Action Fund, which is free of spending limits. This has enabled us to ratchet up our legislative efforts, particularly on climate, and to advocate strong environmental laws even as the stakes increase.”
A BBC investigation in 2007 by reporter Simon Cox found that the European Commission is giving millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to environmental campaigners to run lobbying operations in Brussels. Friends of the Earth Europe (FoE), received almost half of its funding from the EU in 2007.
Greenpeace also don’t mention the money that the EPA gives to NGO’s, for example National Resources Defense Council are currently in receipt of a grant of $1,150,123, (XA – 83379901-2) for promoting carbon trading.
The World Resources Institute (WRI) has received $3,879,014 from the EPA in the last nine years for propaganda projects and promotion of emissions trading schemes, $715,000 in the current period 2011/12. If the EPA really were interested in science, they would be funding the genuine research undertaken by people like Dr Soon, rather than policy promotion for their own agenda.
Members of the board of WRI, are Al Gore and Theodore Roosevelt IV. Mr Roosevelt is the chairman of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. and is the former chairman of the ill-fated Lehman Brothers’ Global Council on Climate Change and a board member of the Alliance for Climate Protection, whose chairman is Al Gore. The 2008 income for Gore’s “Alliance” was over $88 million.
Greenpeace really should be very careful when they seek to muddy the waters on climate science by discrediting opposing scientists, they may well find that the water is full of dirty green linen.

and Donna LaFramboise, BP, Greenpeace & the Big Oil Jackpot , the text of which follows here:
*****************
BP, Greenpeace & the Big Oil Jackpot
In what passes for debate about climate change one of the most tiresome allegations is that skeptics are lavishly funded by big oil. As a result of this funding, so the argument goes, the public has been confused by those who’ll say anything in exchange for a paycheck.
“Follow the money” we’re told and you’ll discover that climate skeptics are irredeemably tainted. Ergo nothing they say can be trusted. Ergo their concerns, questions, and objections should be dismissed out of hand.
It’s therefore amusing that the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is now drawing attention to the close relationship between climate change activists and BP – aka British Petroleum, an entity for which the descriptor “big oil” was surely invented.
According to the Washington Post the green group Nature Conservancy – which encourages ordinary citizens to personally pledge to fight climate change – “has accepted nearly $10 million in cash and land contributions from BP and affiliated corporations over the years.”
Gee, didn’t Greenpeace build an entire ExxonSecrets website to expose the allegedly diabolical fact that, over a 9-year-period (1998-2006) ExxonMobil donated a grand total of $2.2 million to a conservative think tank?
$10 million versus $2 million. Who do we suppose has the cozier relationship with big oil?
But that’s just the beginning. The Washington Post also points out that Conservation International, another green group which insists climate change represents a “profound threat,” has “accepted $2 million in donations from BP over the years and partnered with the company on a number of projects.”
Funny, Greenpeace doesn’t talk about that. Nor does it mention:

that BP is funding research into “ways of tackling the world’s climate problem” at Princeton University to the tune of $2 million per year for 15 years
that BP is funding an energy research institute involving two other US universities to the tune of $500 million – the aim of which is “to develop new sources of energy and reduce the impact of energy consumption on the environment”
that ExxonMobil itself has donated $100 million to Stanford university so that researchers there can find “ways to meet growing energy needs without worsening global warming”

The only dollar amounts Greenpeace cites in its explanation of why it decided to launch ExxonSecrets is that measly $2.2 million. Versus 10 + 2 + 30 + 500 + 100. Let’s see, which all adds up to…wait for it…$642 million.
If the world is divided into two factions – one that believes climate change is a serious problem and another that thinks human influence on the climate is so minimal it’s indistinguishable from background noise – one group has pulled off a bank heist while the other has been panhandling in front of the liquor store.

In the same document in which Greenpeace talks about the ExxonMobil money it chillingly asserts that climate “deniers” aren’t entitled to free speech. Why? Because “Freedom of speech does not apply to misinformation and propaganda.”
Actually, the big thinkers on the subject have consistently taken the opposite view. John Stuart Mill was adamant that no one has the right to decide what is or is not propaganda on everyone else’s behalf. He would have looked Greenpeace in the eye and told it to stop imagining that its own judgment is infallible.
More than a hundred years later Noam Chomsky famously declared that if you don’t believe in freedom of expression for opinions you despise you don’t believe in it at all.
If Greenpeace would like to have a serious conversation about who, exactly, is spreading misinformation I’m up for that – since it’s overwhelming obvious that the big oil jackpot was awarded to those on the Greenpeace side of the debate.
The fact that climate change activists have enjoyed such a powerful funding advantage and yet insisted all the while that the exact opposite was the case is troubling. It tells us a good deal about their intellectual rigour. About their character. And about their ability to distinguish fact from fiction.
If there really is a climate crisis, if our grandchildren’s future really is imperiled, these aren’t the people to lead us out of the wilderness.
 
UPDATE (June 6): Reader Terry Kesteloot alerted me to the fact that the Greenpeace.org website is apparently infected with a “very low” risk computer virus. The links in this post to Greenpeace’s ExxonSecrets FAQ have therefore been replaced with links to a copy of the document that resides at Archive.org (scroll down once the page loads).
If your machine has virus protection, the document may be viewed directly on the Greenpeace website HERE.

"Dear Vice-President Joe Biden, We write to you as leaders from a diverse array of organizations building political power for young people in the United States. We are all deeply committed to ending a presidency that has set the clock back on all of the issues that impact our lives.  While you are now the presumptive Democratic nominee, it is clear that you were unable to win the votes of the vast majority of voters under 45 years old during the primary. With young people poised to play a critical role deciding the next president, you need to have more young people enthusiastically supporting and campaigning with you to defeat Donald Trump. This division must be reconciled so we can unite the party to defeat Trump. Messaging around a “return to normalcy” does not and has not earned the support and trust of voters from our generation. For so many young people, going back to the way things were “before Trump” isn’t a motivating enough reason to cast a ballot in November. And now, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed not only the failure of Trump, but how decades of policymaking has failed to create a robust social safety net for the vast majority of Americans. The views of younger Americans are the result of a series of crises that took hold when we came of political age, and flow from bad decisions made by those in power from both major parties. For millions of young people, our path to a safe and secure middle-class life is far more out-of-reach than it was for our parents or grandparents. We grew up in a world where “doing better than the generation before us” was not a foregone conclusion. Instead, we grew up with endless war, skyrocketing inequality, crushing student loan debt, mass deportations, police murders of black Americans and mass incarceration, schools which have become killing fields, and knowing that the political leaders of today are choking the planet we will live on long after they are gone. We’ve spent our whole lives witnessing our political leaders prioritize the voices of wealthy lobbyists and big corporations over our needs. From this hardship, we’ve powered a resurgence of social movements demanding fundamental change. Why would we want a return to normalcy? We need a vision for the future, not a return to the past. New leadership in November is an imperative for everything our movements are fighting for. But in order to win up and down the ballot in November, the Democratic party needs the energy and enthusiasm of our generation. The victorious “Obama coalition” included millions of energized young people fighting for change. But the Democratic party’s last presidential nominee failed to mobilize our enthusiasm where it mattered. We can’t afford to see those mistakes repeated. Young people are issues-first voters. Fewer identify with a political party than any other generation. Exclusively anti-Trump messaging won’t be enough to lead any candidate to victory. We need you to champion the bold ideas that have galvanized our generation and given us hope in the political process. As the party’s nominee, the following commitments are needed to earn the support of our generation and unite the party for a general election against Donald Trump: Climate change: Adopt the frameworks of the Green New Deal and make specific commitments around achieving a just transition to 100% clean energy by 2030 for electricity, buildings and transportation; restart the economy by committing to mobilizing $10tn in green stimulus and infrastructure investments over 10 years that will create tens of millions of good jobs of the future; and commit to take on and prosecute the fossil fuel executives and lobbyists who have criminally jeopardized our generation. Gun violence prevention: Take an intersectional, comprehensive approach to preventing gun violence with the goal of reducing gun deaths by 50% in 10 years. In addition to the policies laid out in your plan, you should also include the following from the Peace Plan for a Safer America: call for a federal licensing program; hold the gun industry accountable by directing the IRS to probe the NRA’s not-for-profit status. Expand federal funding and resources for community-based violence intervention programs. Adopt Julián Castro’s People First Policing Plan and acknowledge that police brutality is gun violence. Immigration: Commit to immediate executive actions to expand Daca and other policies to protect people from deportation and hold Ice and CBP accountable. Executive actions must also close the vast and cruel web of detention camps and not replace it with a practice of tagging people with electronic monitors or surveillance sold by big-money corporations. Commit to ending the collaboration between local police and Ice and the use of racial profiling by deportation agents and local police that pulls people into the deportation pipeline. Commit to providing guaranteed access to counsel for all while making immigration courts independent and free of political manipulation. Commit to repealing the 1996 immigration reform laws and creating citizenship pathways for all undocumented people without harmful provisions. Amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that all people, including undocumented immigrants, must be included in any healthcare reform as viruses do not discriminate on the basis of immigration status. Healthcare: Support the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act to allow the government to manufacture generic versions of drugs and dramatically lower prescription drug prices. Support Medicare for All, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Champion the repeal of the Hyde amendment and people’s ability to access abortion care regardless of their income or zip code. Criminalization: Champion comprehensive reform of our criminal legal system. Incentivize states to cut their incarcerated population by 50% while supporting massive investment in housing, drug treatment, diversion, education and health programs. End the war on drugs and support the equitable legalization of marijuana based on proposals laid out by Senator Booker, Senator Warren, Senator Sanders, Secretary Castro and others. Education: Support free undergraduate tuition for public colleges, universities and vocational schools for all students, regardless of income, citizenship status or criminal record. Provide economic relief to 45 million Americans and stimulate the economy by addressing the student debt crisis and canceling the entire $1.7tn in student loan debt. Wealth tax: Support an annual tax on the extreme wealth of the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are in the top 0.1% based on proposals laid out by Senator Sanders, Senator Warren and Tom Steyer. Foreign policy: Commit to seek congressional approval on any authorization of war and support repeal of 2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Democracy: Support the elimination of the filibuster and the expanding of the supreme court. Call for the adoption of strong anti-corruption reforms laid out by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders. Champion a voting system that works for all Americans. Every citizen should be automatically registered to vote, get to cast their ballot in a secure, accessible way that fits their needs, and never have their right to vote taken away for any reason. Get big money out of politics and make the passage of HR 1 a top priority. Commit to appointing progressive elected officials who endorsed Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as transition co-chairs, such as representatives Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal, Ayanna Pressley or Katie Porter. Pledge to appoint zero current or former Wall Street executives or corporate lobbyists, or people affiliated with the fossil fuel, health insurance or private prison corporations, to your transition team, adviser roles or cabinet. Appoint a trusted progressive to lead the White House presidential personnel office to ensure that the entire administration is free of corruption and staffed with public servants committed to advancing a progressive agenda. Commit to put trusted voices on issues of importance to our generation on your campaign and transition team’s policy working groups, such as Governor Inslee’s policy team on climate; Senator Warren’s policy team on financial regulation; Aramis Ayala, Bryan Stevenson and Larry Krasner on criminal justice; Bonnie Castillo of National Nurses United and Dr Abdul El-Sayed on healthcare; and Mary-Kay Henry, Sara Nelson and Senator Sanders’ policy team on jobs and the economy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week German meteorologist Dominik Jung openly wondered what had happened to all the warming, pointing out that Germany was suffering from its fifth consecutive colder than normal winter – a record!
Earlier this month renowned meteorologist Prof. Dr. Horst Marlberg announced that global warming was finished, and that cooling was ahead for the next decades.
Last month German meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt (photo above) dismissed (again) global warming catastrophism.
And just days ago, yet another German meteorology site questioned global warming in a piece titled: “Global Warming Stagnates – Guessing The Causes“. The report begins:
Since 1998 the global mean temperature has not risen significantly. While the global temperature rose by about 0.5°C from the 1970s until the end of the 1990s, it has stagnated for the last 15 years, though at a high level. […] The stagnation surprised a lot of experts, who are now searching for possible causes for this development.”
Wetteronline.de then explains the various theories, writing that the stagnation may be due to weakened solar activity, or because of huge emissions of aerosols over Asia – global dimming – or perhaps because of ocean currents.

Wetteronline.de ends its report with:
The climate system of the Earth is very complex. There are still many interrelationships, factors, and feedbacks affecting the climate that are not known or still not adequately researched. Thus a combination of the above factors is possible for explaining the stagnation in worldwide temperature. But also a completely unknown phenomenon that climate science knows nothing about is possible. Even a natural variation of the climate cannot be excluded.”
The author of this report is getting warmer, and warmer. He’s on the right path, and really only needs to pick up a copy of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s “Die kalte Sonne“. The book lays it all out on what’s behind climate change. Read it, and decide for yourself. It’s great reading, especially for meteorologists.
One thing is sure: the science of climate change is no longer an open and shut case – not by any means. The consensus that humans are driving the climate is more shattered than ever in Germany, and is crumbling at an increasing velocity.
If Professor Schellnhuber and his PIK wish to implement their “Great Transformation” of global society, they’d better hurry up!

"**The R number has fallen below one for the first time since mid-August, which means the epidemic is thought to be no longer growing.**
The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, to between 0.9 and 1.
The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread.
R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average.
Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity.
That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others.
Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about 3 if no action was taken to stop it spreading.
You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.
Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.
If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card.
But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.
Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one.
The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops.
Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in the spring.
Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.
**Scotland's** estimated R number is between 0.8 and 1.
In **Wales** the number is thought to be between 0.8 and 1 \- while in **Northern Ireland** it is about 1.
In **England** , the highest estimated R rate is in the South East, where it is between 1 and 1.2.
The UK government said in the past that the R number was one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.
It then said estimates were less reliable and less useful because the number of cases was relatively low.
But when cases started to rise again, more attention was once again paid to local and national R rates.
The aim will be to keep the R number below one.
The **R number** is one of the big three.
Another is **severity** \- some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly.
The last is the **number of cases** , which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.
Having a vaccine is another way to bring down the reproduction number.
A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.

 **Dec. 17 (Bloomberg)** — World leaders flying into Copenhagen today to discuss a solution to global warming will first face freezing weather as a blizzard dumped 10 centimeters (4 inches) of snow on the Danish capital overnight.   
  
  
**Copenhagen (CNN)** –- In a strange twist, a Washington snowstorm is forcing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D‐​California, to make an early departure from a global warming summit here in Denmark.   
  
  
Pelosi told CNN that military officials leading her Congressional delegation have urged the 21 lawmakers to leave Copenhagen several hours earlier than scheduled on Saturday.   
  
  
The Speaker said she has agreed to the new travel plan so that lawmakers can get back to Washington before much of the expected storm wallops the nation’s capital.   
  
  
**_Washington Post_**: Before long, we will be buried by several times that amount making this a record breaking December storm. Double digit accumulations have already been reported to our south in central Virginia. This is a dangerous, severe storm with the worst still to come.   
  
  
…   
  
  
True enough, as President Obama’s courtiers at Media Matters remind us, one day’s weather doesn’t change the climate. Indeed, they quote Pat Michaels making that point last year in the _New York Times_ : 



Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist and commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, has long chided environmentalists and the media for overstating connections between extreme weather and human‐​caused warming. (He is on the program at the skeptics’ conference.)   
  
  
But Dr. Michaels said that those now trumpeting global cooling should beware of doing the same thing, saying that the ”predictable distortion” of extreme weather ”goes in both directions.”



Still, I think we know that if it were unseasonably warm this week, there’d be people pointing that out on television from Copenhagen.

"**Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the Covid vaccine in England.**
The rollout is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval.
Mr Zahawi, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, will oversee distribution of the vaccine until at least next summer.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""delighted"", adding in a tweet there was ""an enormous task ahead"".
Under the interim arrangement, Mr Zahawi will serve as a joint minister between the health department and the business department, where he currently works.
His primary focus will be on delivering the vaccine, with most areas of his business portfolio put aside.
It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.
In a tweet, Mr Zahawi welcomed his new post but said the rollout would be a ""big responsibility and a big operational challenge"".
He added that he was ""absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly - saving lives and livelihoods and helping us #buildbackbetter"".
Mr Zahawi will look after deployment of the vaccine in England only, but will work with the devolved administrations on their chosen approach. Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be responsible for the vaccine's distribution in their relevant nations.
Currently, the UK government has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, 40 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech and five million doses from US firm Moderna.
Rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may pose the greatest challenge as it needs to be stored at minus 70C, raising potential difficulties with transport and storage.
Last week, the government asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, marking ""a significant first step"" in getting the vaccine ""approved for deployment"".
It follows a similar referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) earlier this month to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has been shown to stop more than 90% of people developing Covid-19 symptoms in preliminary trials.
On Saturday, the Financial Times reported that regulatory approval for that vaccine could come as early as next week - and suggested rollout would start within hours of authorisation.
Interim data from the trials of the Oxford jab showed an overall efficacy of 70%. The findings from one group of volunteers showed 62% efficacy while another group, who were given a different dose by accident, showed 90% efficacy.
The Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if it is authorised, with AstraZeneca set to have as many as four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021.
**By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News**
In ministerial terms, it's a sideways move.
But Nadhim Zahawi's new job comes with huge public expectation, and therefore the potential for political disaster.
The government is only too aware of the bloody nose it has received as a result of the shortcomings of NHS Test and Trace programme and the procurement of PPE at the start of the pandemic.
Government scientists have said, if proven to be safe and effective, mass vaccinations will offer a ""much better horizon"" by the spring.
Hospitals and other NHS trusts in England say they have been told to get ready to administer jabs from the middle of December. The winter flu vaccine programme will offer some framework for how that will work in practice.
Mr Zahawi is seen as a good media performer. He has a business background and helped to set up the polling group YouGov. He'll understand only too well the delicate art of keeping public opinion on side.
Mr Zahawi's appointment follows calls from Labour for the government to appoint a vaccine minister, who would provide accountability and avoid repeating mistakes made over PPE procurement and NHS Test and Trace.
Shadow health secretary John Ashworth said: ""Only days ago Labour called for a vaccines minister to oversee the huge logistical challenge of widespread vaccination.
""We now need a mass public health campaign urging uptake of the vaccine, alongside ensuring the resources are in place for GPs and other health professionals to rapidly roll this out as soon as possible.""
In addition to the vaccine rollout, the prime minister has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends on 2 December.
Earlier this week, Mr Zahawi tweeted that he was ""extremely disappointed and sad"" that Warwickshire, the county in which his constituency lies, would be placed in the most restricted tier - tier three - after England's national lockdown ends next week.
He said he would be pushing for the county of Warwickshire to be considered separately from Coventry and Solihull in all future decisions about restrictions and for the rollout of mass testing - but urged residents ""to continue following the rules to the letter"" in the meantime."

"The inhabitants of a frequently cold and windy country like the UK need to heat their homes, even in what is loosely termed “summer”. This is achieved mostly by natural gas-fed boilers – but this dependence on gas is unsustainable in the long term if the country aims to meet its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2013, the government published a heat strategy and this year it extended the Renewable Heat Incentive from non-domestic buildings to also include homes. This provides a subsidy to people installing low-carbon heating technologies, with the aim of building up new markets and supply chains, pushing down costs and expanding the take-up of low-carbon heating. But the list of technologies for which a subsidy is currently available – heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal heating – excludes hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, despite studies that show they could contribute to hitting emissions targets in 2050. Heat pumps are the most controversial inclusion in the list, as currently they generate more emissions gas boilers when the electricity needed to operate them is taken into account. This inconsistency stems from the the fact that the subsidy’s aim is to contribute toward the EU obligation of generating 20% of energy consumption from renewables by 2020, rather than to cut overall greenhouse gas emissions.  The ambient heat used by heat pumps counts towards this EU obligation, while the emissions from the electricity generation are overlooked. This policy will increase UK emissions in the next few years if many people swap their gas boilers for heat pumps. Our team of scientists from UCL and Imperial College London published a report that challenges the orthodoxy displayed by these slim selection of technologies, exploring the potential for fuel cells and other hydrogen-powered technologies to contribute to the heating market. Fuel cells, which generate electricity from chemical reactions, are already in use around the world for heating. Although they have mainly been viewed in Britain as a future power source for vehicles, in fact more commercial fuel cells have been sold for heating than for any other use. Sales of residential fuel cells have been doubling annually in Japan, Korea and in Europe. At the same time fuel cell costs have fallen substantially in recent years, to the extent that they will be sold without subsidised in Japan from 2015. These fuel cells are powered by natural gas, which is reformed into hydrogen within the fuel cell. If these were used in the UK, the net carbon emissions would be lower than using heat pumps for at least the next ten years. This is because emissions from electricity generation (0.48kg CO2/kWh) are currently much higher than those from natural gas (0.19kg CO2/kWh). This gap will gradually close as more renewables are built and coal power stations are retired. Further into the future, it might be possible to pipe hydrogen to homes and businesses as a low-carbon alternative to natural gas. Hydrogen could replace natural gas in modern, efficient condensing boilers or power fuel cells. This would avoid some of the disadvantages of alternative technologies such as heat pumps, which have high up-front costs, perform poorly if installed badly, and take up a lot of space in homes and buildings. Hydrogen can be produced from numerous fuels, reducing the reliance of the UK on oil and gas from abroad. As they operate apart from the national grid, fuel cells provide decentralised electricity generation, reducing load on the grid and providing power even during blackouts. Fuel cells could also help to avoid costly changes to the electricity networks in the future by generating electricity at peak times, in the event that the use of heat pumps and electric cars becomes more widespread. Despite the potential benefits, hydrogen and fuel cells have consistently been excluded or marginalised in government technology assessments, which instead focus only on those technologies in the Renewable Heat Incentive, together with combined heat and power systems and district heating. Most UK-focused studies used to support policy papers have also not considered hydrogen and fuel cells. The fact is that without government support in the early development stages, no low-carbon technology will be successful. Policies to address market failures for low-carbon heat technologies generally don’t include fuel cells and hydrogen – despite the fact that in other countries such as Japan, such support has provided the springboard required for the technology to reach commercial maturity. While the Renewable Heat Incentive does have a procedure for supporting new technologies, there is no prospect of this being used to support either fuel cells or hydrogen in the near future.  There is a big opportunity for Britain to develop a successful hydrogen and fuel cell industry for heating: the UK has a strong scientific and engineering research base, and support at home would enable UK companies to capture a share of fast-growing global supply chains. The potential of hydrogen and fuel cells – to provide homes and businesses with secure, low-carbon heat and – means that it’s high time they were considered in government roadmaps and policies, on a level playing field with other low-carbon technologies, and brought in from the cold."
"Volcanic eruptions played an important and direct role in triggering the extreme climate that killed off swathes of life at the end of the Triassic period 201m years ago, researchers have found. Experts say they have discovered bubbles of carbon dioxide trapped in volcanic rocks dating to the end of the Triassic, backing up the theory that such activity contributed to the greenhouse climate that is believed to have been behind the mass extinction.  “This biotic crisis wiped out almost half of the existing species of the late Triassic in both marine and terrestrial realms,” said Manfredo Capriolo of the University of Padova in Italy, a co-author of the study. While Capriolo noted the end-Triassic mass extinction has long been known to have been caused by extreme climate change, and that there was large-scale volcanic activity at the time, he said it had been unclear whether the volcanic activity directly contributed to the extinction event. Among other possibilities, he said, it could have been that magma caused the emission of gases as it flowed into shallow sediments.  The new work, said Capriolo, shows that carbon dioxide released directly by volcanic activity would indeed have made a large contribution to the devastating climate change of the time. Indeed the team say the amount of carbon emissions released in a single pulse of eruptions – which would have resulted in about 100,000 km3 of lava being spewed forth over 500 years – is on a par with the total expected to be produced by human activity over the 21st century, assuming a 2C rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels. That, they say, offers a sobering warning for today. “[This] suggests that the end-Triassic climatic and environmental changes, driven by CO2 emissions, may have been similar to those predicted for the near future,” the team write. Capriolo stressed the similarity in CO2 levels was striking. “The end-Triassic world and the modern one are very different, as well as the origin of the greenhouse gas emissions, but we, as geoscientists, announce this alarming comparison,” he said. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Capriolo and colleagues report how they studied more than 200 samples of rock from North America, Morocco and Portugal. These were deposited towards the end of the Triassic, in volcanic activity that contributed to the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent and the opening up of the central Atlantic Ocean, with the rocks creating what is known as the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province – a vast expanse covering an area about a third of the size the moon. The team found around 10% of the samples showed the presences of bubbles within small blobs of magma trapped by crystals in the rocks, most of which were found to contain carbon dioxide. Further analysis, they say, suggests the gas probably became entrapped deep within the Earth’s crust, suggesting it originated in the lower-middle crust or in the mantle. From these findings the team were able to calculate the concentration of carbon dioxide that would have been present in the magma of the volcanic eruptions, revealing that up to 100,000 Gt of carbon dioxide would have been released in total as the volcanic rocks were laid down. Dr Jessica Whiteside, associate professor of geochemistry at the University of Southampton who was not involved in the work, said the role of volcanic activity in the end-Triassic mass extinction had been a matter of much debate. “Over the past 30 years, the question as to whether widespread volcanic eruptions trigger climatic effects severe enough to result in extinction has waxed and waned, from most certainly no to most certainly yes,” she said.  The new study, she said, added weight to the latter view. “The study reports new evidence that is the most conclusive that has been produced for CO2 being emitted directly from individual lava eruptions relating to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province,” she said, adding that the report reveals pulses of the eruptions spewed out amounts on a par to those produced by human activities, with devastating effects. That, Whiteside added, provided lessons for today. “The initiation of these eruptions created one of the warmest climate since the dawn of animal life on our planet, and coincided with massive extinction on land and in the oceans,” she said."

For years India has disappointed expectations. Tagged as the next great power preparing to challenge China and eventually America, India instead has lagged economically, stagnated politically, and battled religiously. Now Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won a stunning political victory. India’s future depends on Modi’s ability to transcend his sectarian roots and govern on behalf of all Indians.



India achieved political independence in 1947, when the British colony was divided into largely Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. Twelve million people abandoned their homes and hundreds of thousands of them died in the process. Nevertheless, many religious minorities remained behind. For instance, India’s Muslim population runs roughly 177 million, the 3rd largest on earth — behind only Indonesia and Pakistan.



Throughout the Cold War the Delhi government kept its people poor by mismanaging the economy. Indian officials followed Stalinist economic nostrums to develop and depended on foreign aid to make ends meet. Politics was dominated by the dynastic India National Congress Party, which treated the system as the property of the Nehru‐​Gandhi family. Eventually change came to India: the Congress Party began economic reforms and the BJP broke the Congress political monopoly.



India is a secular republic in which freedom of religion is formally protected. However, legislation authorizes government interference in the name of preventing conduct “promoting enmity,” undermining “harmony,” intending to “outrage religious feelings,” insult “religious beliefs,” and more. In these cases, noted the State Department’s report on religious liberty, Delhi restricts “minorities’ freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.” Moreover, 7 of 28 states have passed anti‐​conversion laws, which target proselytizing.





The Indian people need more opportunity, not more dependency.



Of particular concern is the government’s inability or unwillingness to combat religious violence and prosecute those responsible. Explained the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom: “Despite the country’s status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, India has struggled to protect minority communities or provide justice when crimes occur due to a lack of political will, political corruption, and religious bias by government officials. This exacerbates the climate of impunity that already exists in the country.”



Much violence occurs between the two largest groups, Hindus and Muslims, but other religious minorities also are targeted. In 2007 and 2008 in the state of Odisha (formerly known as Orissa) rioting Hindus murdered scores of Christians, forced thousands to flee, and destroyed many homes and churches. Mobs even torched a Christian orphanage, killing a 21‐​year‐​old Hindu teacher. The pogram was long in the making. In 2007 Human Rights Watch reported: “For several years, extremist Hindu groups in Orissa have been conducting an anti‐​Christian campaign that has grown violent at times, while government officials have looked the other way.”



Earlier this year Hindu radicals attacked a house church in the southern province of Karnataka — police then arrested _the minister and several church members_ for allegedly coercing conversions. A report from the Mumbai‐​based Catholic‐​Secular Forum and several Christian organizations estimated that roughly 4000 Christians were targeted by acts of violence last year, most committed by Hindu extremists.



Unfortunately, India’s presumptive prime minister, Narendra Modi, was implicated in one of the country’s worst episodes of sectarian violence. In 2002 in the state of Gujarat, in which Modi served as chief minister, Hindu rioters killed more than 1200 people, mostly Muslims, and forced 150,000 people from their homes. Eventually the Indian military and national police restored order. Critics charged Modi with both encouraging the violence and failing to stop it. Investigations and court cases went on for years.



Several cabinet ministers were found to be involved, but specific evidence of Modi’s culpability was lacking — or perhaps destroyed. So Modi was absolved of responsibility, though prosecutors may not have looked very hard. He defends his conduct, saying he only wishes he had handled the media better.



In any case, Modi has ridden a sectarian tide to power. He graduated to the BJP from the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (“National Volunteer Society”), which he joined young. He denounced Muslims early in his career and was involved in activities leading to communal violence in 1992 when a massive Hindu mob destroyed the Babri Mosque in the city of Ayodhya. He refused to condemn riots last year in the state of Uttar Pradesh primarily directed against Muslims. This year he received strong backing from the RSS and ran for a second parliamentary seat from the Hindu holy city of Varanasi, which is seen as a center of Hinduism. A number of his closest associates are pronounced Hindu nationalists.



The good news in Modi’s victory is that he was elected to reform the faltering economy, not stoke the fires of religious hatred. Gujarat has prospered — with 5 percent of India’s population it accounts for 16 percent of industrial output and 22 percent of exports — and the BJP is committed to relaxing India’s often stultifying government regulations. The quickest way for the new government to discourage foreign investment would be to trigger more sectarian violence. Doing so also could be politically costly: Indian voters just demonstrated their impatience for results by slashing the Congress Party’s representation in parliament by roughly three‐​quarters.



Relations with the U.S. will be a key issue. The Bush administration took a dramatic leap by formally acknowledging Delhi’s acquisition of nuclear weapons. Doing so significantly improved bilateral ties. Since then, however, relations have stagnated, and recently suffered from trade disputes and criminal allegations against an Indian diplomat in New York.



Modi’s election poses another challenge. In 2005 the State Department refused to issue him a visa because of his presumed role in the Gujarat violence. James North of the blog Mondoweiss argued that resolute American opposition to Modi before the latest vote could have forced Indians to choose another prime minister. In fact, such a public stance almost certainly would have increased his support. Even Indians who don’t like Modi would not allow Washington to determine who ran their government.



Instead, the Obama administration has begun a diplomatic dance with Modi. The U.S. ambassador to India met with him in February in a visit presented as normal outreach to Indian political figures, signaling recognition that he was likely to triumph in the upcoming election. President Barack Obama congratulated Modi after the latter’s victory and extended an invitation to visit America. No doubt the visa ban will be quietly forgotten.



And none too soon, since Beijing also has formally welcomed Modi’s victory. While Washington has nothing for which to apologize — whatever Modi’s exact conduct in 2002, he has contributed to sectarian hatred — the U.S. cannot ignore the incoming head of the government of one of the world’s most important nations. Indeed, the U.S. long has dealt with far worse political leaders. And Washington’s embrace doesn’t mean Modi will have smooth sailing. Some Indian‐​Americans blame Modi for the Gujarat violence and helped establish the Coalition Against Genocide, which has threatened to file suit against him should he visit.



The responsibility to reconcile is not Washington’s alone. Set to become perhaps the most powerful Indian prime minister since Indira Gandhi three decades ago, he should attempt to set foreign governments and, even more important, his own citizens at ease.



After the election results were announced, he said that “The age of divisive politics has ended, from today onwards the politics of uniting people will begin.” It was a good beginning, but with many activists in both the RSS and BJP promoting Hindutva, or “Hinduness,” he needs to clearly communicate that he will be prime minister of all and his government will not tolerate violence or discrimination against religious minorities. Then he must live up to that promise. Political commentator Neerja Chowdhury argued: “Many people in India and around the world will be watching whether he reaches out to minorities in the coming days.” Doing so would enable Delhi to don the moral mantle of the world’s largest democracy, despite past communal strife.



Modi has a historic opportunity. His party carried both rural and urban areas, as well as younger voters, who now predominate in the electorate. His government will be the first in years to enjoy a solid majority in the Lok Sabha, or lower house. The people he will represent are both entrepreneurial and impatient, demanding the chance to better their lives.



However, he must get economic reform right. Although pro‐​business, he has not always been pro‐​market. Kleptocratic or crony corporatism may buy votes and reward friends, but it does not grow economies and increase wealth. The Indian people need more opportunity, not more dependency.



The choice soon will be up to Narendra Modi. Much around the globe depends on what he decides.

"**Health bosses in the north-east of England are pushing to be allowed to run their own coronavirus tracing.**
The Newcastle Hospitals Trust is due to open a new Lighthouse lab able to process 80,000 tests a day in January.
The trust will also run a co-ordination hub providing virus data to help public health teams respond to local cases.
Chief operating officer Martin Wilson said it was ""making very strong representations"" to government about also localising contact tracing.
""We are keen to see a move to localised tracking and tracing,"" he said.
The trust was ""still in discussions"" about how the work of the Co-ordination Response Centre (CRC) hub could be extended to include this, he said.
The Department of Health and Social Care said local and national teams were ""working closely together"".
More than 150 councils were ""provided with extensive data and supported to manage local outbreaks"" with a ring-fenced group of contact tracers, a spokesperson said.
Newcastle City Council director of public health Prof Eugene Milne said the council wanted to ""stand the system on its head"" to have local teams managing cases and controlling work allocated to Test and Trace call handlers.
""Instead of the initial contact being through somebody remote, from a telephone number that you don't know, from somebody who doesn't know the local situation, the first call is from somebody who does understand all of those things,"" he said.
Talks were under way on whether the private companies currently running the tracing system would accept that, he said.
Most of the 1,000 lab staff would be analysing swab samples from people in the North East, Yorkshire and Humberside who had taken tests at home or at walk-in or drive-in centres.
About 100 staff would work in the CRC to give public health teams ""that real intelligence about where the cases are and they can act on it"", Mr Wilson said.
If local tracing was not allowed, lab results would be fed back into the centralised system to be sent out to individuals and passed to Test and Trace.
British Medical Association North East chairman Dr George Rae said contact tracing should be led by local public health teams, whose ""expertise and knowledge"" had not been used enough.
""I'm not saying that you don't want the national system but I think that the equilibrium has been massively imbalanced up to now,"" he said.

John Allison, CEO of the Cato Institute and former CEO of BB&T Corporation, announced today that Cato has established a new Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, which will focus on development of policy recommendations that will create a more free‐​market monetary system in the U.S.



“We have assembled a group of scholars and advisory board members who will challenge the Federal Reserve and the financial regulators in a way they haven’t been challenged in 100 years,” Allison said.



George Selgin, a Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Georgia and one of the foremost authorities on banking and monetary theory and history, gave up his academic tenure to join Cato as director of the new center.



“If there’s ever to be a serious attempt to come up with something better than the Fed, we must bury the myth that it’s our only hope” Selgin said. “We don’t want to turn back the clock to 1913, or to any other bygone era. But we do need to change the intellectual climate from the present one — with its hostile and ill‐​informed response to any suggestion that a monetary system consistent with the rule of law and genuine competition might be an improvement upon our present autocratic central bank.”



Allison, who grew BB&T from $4.5 billion to $152 billion in assets during his 20 years as CEO, was recognized by the Harvard Business Review as one of the top 100 most successful CEOs in the world over the last decade.



“What I learned over my 40‐​year career in the banking business is that the more government micromanages lending and management practices, the less helpful real bankers can be to the lifeblood of the economy – small businesses and individuals,” said Allison.



The Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives will explore policy options that include creation of a private deposit insurance pool for small depositors, as well as measures that would expose even the largest financial institutions to a genuine risk of failure, and thereby compel them to either acquire more capital or take fewer risks.



“The new myth is that the recent financial crisis and failed recovery were caused by banking deregulation and greed on Wall Street,” Allison said in his book, The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure. “In truth, the banking industry was never deregulated…it was misregulated.”



Dodd‐​Frank has also given the Federal Reserve expanded powers which continue the agency down a path of hindering more than helping the economy.



“Since its inception, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have been a primary cause of artificial booms that lead to recessions and depressions,” Allison said.



In response, Cato’s monetary center will examine alternatives to pure discretionary government fiat money, including various monetary rules to reduce uncertainty and prevent the Federal Reserve from engaging in credit allocation and fiscal policy.



Luminaries from the banking policy world who have signed on to the Executive Advisory Council for the new Center include Richard Kovacevich, Chairman Emeritus of Wells Fargo, and George Melloan, former Deputy Editor of the _Wall Street Journal_.



The Council of Academic Advisors includes two Nobel Laureates in Economics, Thomas J. Sargent, from New York University, and Vernon L. Smith of Chapman University. John B. Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford, Richard Timberlake, professor emeritus from the University of Georgia, and Guillermo Calvo, a professor of economics at Columbia University, also serve on the council.



James A. Dorn, Vice President for Monetary Studies and the long‐​time director of Cato’s annual monetary conference, will play a major role in management of the Center. Mark Calabria, Director of Financial Regulation Studies at Cato, will also move to the new Center. Before joining Cato in 2009, Calabria served six years as a senior staff member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.



“Our intent is that the work of the Center will result in a comprehensive, practical roadmap for implementing the fundamental policy reform needed to preserve liberty and prosperity through a free market monetary and financial system,” Selgin said.

"**The coronavirus pandemic has meant some people have needed to use video-conferencing software to kick their drug and alcohol addictions.**
Gary Besterfield, from We Are With You Redcar and Cleveland, said software had meant the charity could support more people.
Jade Hargreaves, from Burnley, has been sober for three years and said losing face-to-face meetings was difficult.
""But people have got clean this year on Zoom and that's amazing. Hats off to them because it's hard,"" she said.
Recovery services have had to adapt in 2020 and with demand increasing, We Are With You, formerly known as Addaction, said lessons had been learned in lockdown that would shape the way it worked in future.
Founded in 1967, it has offered support to people struggling with drug, alcohol or mental health issues and said the impact of the pandemic was evident in the number of people using its web chat service to speak to advisers.
Jade Hargreaves said losing face-to-face meetings during lockdown had been difficult.
Speaking to the BBC podcast Unusual Times, she said: ""We've all had to get used to Zoom. I'm all 'Zoomed out' but it's become a daily thing.
""I think we're entering a new normal but, for people like me, we need to be able to see someone's eyes and see how they're responding and building up trust and, when you're new to recovery, you really need that.""
It was traumatic events in her teenage years that led to her drug and alcohol addiction, Jade said.
""My dad committed suicide when I was 13. Six months later I found out my mum was dying of cancer.
""I ended up addicted to alcohol and then other drugs. I guess I didn't know that because my mental health was embroiled in it.
""I spent time on psychiatric units and spent a good patch of time homeless. It was very chaotic.""
The first step in Jade's recovery was getting help from Centrepoint - a charity that provides accommodation to support homeless people aged 16-25.
""How can you get back on form without a stable place to live? You just can't, because your basic needs aren't being met,"" she said.
""It started once I got accommodated and had support workers saying 'what about college?' and believing in me.""
Jade said things got worse before they got better but with a partner, a home, two children and a level of stability, she felt in a much better place than she had been, but the pandemic had almost caused a relapse.
She said when lockdown first began in March she nearly went to the shop to buy some alcohol.
""I thought 'you've worked hard, Jade, you deserve a drink' and if it wasn't for my partner saying 'I won't be around for long if you do' I think I would have had a drink.
""I'd started to isolate myself, not through choice, I didn't have the connection I had with other people. It was hard not having face-to-face meetings and seeing my friends who are clean too.
""The sad thing is, throughout lockdown, some of my friends have died and I firmly believe it's because everything got closed down. The connection that people like me need all got took away.
""There's four people I know who've died this year through overdosing, and a lot of my friends have relapsed"".
Gary Besterfield has been working in the sector for 20 years and said people accessed services because they were going through a difficult period and were often dealing with some form of loss.
This month, the number of web chat conversations was 91% higher than a year ago. In October, the service saw a 117% rise.
And the charity expected to see ""a significant increase"" in demand in 2021 as it entered January - a ""notoriously busy"" period for treatment services.
Meetings play an important part in recovery - both for those seeking help for the first time, and those who have been in treatment for longer.
""In what is a testing year, people are losing their position in society, their jobs, their loved ones and there's increased isolation,"" he said.
""Lockdown has enabled us to open the doors to those people that might not come through our services usually but are more likely to engage with us digitally.
""We need to make sure people know they may not need to actually come in and can talk to us over the phone or on a laptop.""
Dan Owens, from Hastings, first took drugs when he was 14.
Moving through his teenage years, his drug use went from cannabis to ecstasy. In the years that followed he ""went through everything"".
""A few years ago I started calming down but in the process I found myself with a dependency on benzodiazepines and only a year ago I was dependant on opiates.
""You name it, I'd take it. I was a complete mess.
""I sorted myself out and went to a recovery clinic. It was very hard, very difficult. I hadn't learnt how to deal with reality - I had no resilience.
""It took me about 10 months to gradually wean myself off. This was during lockdown as well so it was even more difficult.
""There isn't a support system really because you can't see your friends. It's challenging and I think a lot of people will be experiencing the same.
""It's when you're in isolation these sort of risk-taking behaviours can come to light.""
The 31-year-old has just started a role as a peer mentor with drugs charity Change Grow Live.
""A lot of the meetings are through Zoom at the moment. It seems like they've got the service running the best it can. Hopefully in the new year things will change and we can see those centres open again.""

On July 1, 2001, a nationwide law in Portugal took effect that decriminalized all drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Under the new legal framework, all drugs were “decriminalized,” not “legalized.” Thus, drug possession for personal use and drug usage itself are still legally prohibited, but violations of those prohibitions are deemed to be exclusively administrative violations and are removed completely from the criminal realm. Drug trafficking continues to be prosecuted as a criminal offense.



While other states in the European Union have developed various forms of de facto decriminalization — whereby substances perceived to be less serious (such as cannabis) rarely lead to criminal prosecution — Portugal remains the only EU member state with a law explicitly declaring drugs to be “decriminalized.” Because more than seven years have now elapsed since enactment of Portugal’s decriminalization system, there are ample data enabling its effects to be assessed.



Notably, decriminalization has become increasingly popular in Portugal since 2001. Except for some far‐​right politicians, very few domestic political factions are agitating for a repeal of the 2001 law. And while there is a widespread perception that bureaucratic changes need to be made to Portugal’s decriminalization framework to make it more efficient and effective, there is no real debate about whether drugs should once again be criminalized. More significantly, none of the nightmare scenarios touted by preenactment decriminalization opponents — from rampant increases in drug usage among the young to the transformation of Lisbon into a haven for “drug tourists” — has occurred.



The political consensus in favor of decriminalization is unsurprising in light of the relevant empirical data. Those data indicate that decriminalization has had no adverse effect on drug usage rates in Portugal, which, in numerous categories, are now among the lowest in the EU, particularly when compared with states with stringent criminalization regimes. Although postdecriminalization usage rates have remained roughly the same or even decreased slightly when compared with other EU states, drug‐​related pathologies — such as sexually transmitted diseases and deaths due to drug usage — have decreased dramatically. Drug policy experts attribute those positive trends to the enhanced ability of the Portuguese government to offer treatment programs to its citizens — enhancements made possible, for numerous reasons, by decriminalization.



This report will begin with an examination of the Portuguese decriminalization framework as set forth in law and in terms of how it functions in practice. Also examined is the political climate in Portugal both pre‐ and postdecriminalization with regard to drug policy, and the impetus that led that nation to adopt decriminalization.



The report then assesses Portuguese drug policy in the context of the EU’s approach to drugs. The varying legal frameworks, as well as the overall trend toward liberalization, are examined to enable a meaningful comparative assessment between Portuguese data and data from other EU states.



The report also sets forth the data concerning drug‐​related trends in Portugal both pre‐ and postdecriminalization. The effects of decriminalization in Portugal are examined both in absolute terms and in comparisons with other states that continue to criminalize drugs, particularly within the EU.



The data show that, judged by virtually every metric, the Portuguese decriminalization framework has been a resounding success. Within this success lie self‐​evident lessons that should guide drug policy debates around the world.

"The UK’s efforts to cut greenhouse gases are being undermined by a failure to put in place climate policies that cover imported goods, research has found. The government is committed to cutting the UK’s carbon output to net zero by 2050, and emissions have been falling for the past three decades. But that does not take into account the “invisible” side of Britain’s carbon footprint, which comes from international travel and the carbon produced overseas to make goods that are used here.  About half of Britain’s true carbon footprint is made up of these sources, according to a report from the conservation charity WWF. Emissions associated with imports to the UK, including international travel, have risen from about 316m tonnes of carbon in 1990 to 360m tonnes in 2016 and 358m tonnes in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. These imported emissions can vary substantially from year to year, but have been broadly steady or rising, though they are down from a peak of 449m in 2007, before the financial crisis. Over the same period, between 1990 and 2016, the UK’s own carbon emissions fell by more than 40%, thanks mainly to a long switch away from coal-fired power to gas and renewable sources of electricity, according to the report published on Thursday. The carbon associated with the manufacture of imported goods appears in the carbon accounts of the manufacturing country. However, some countries have less stringent carbon targets than others, and developing countries may struggle to use low-carbon methods as they pursue economic growth. International aviation is not covered by countries’ national carbon targets, under the UN climate talks and the Paris agreement. “If all other countries were going for net zero too, then this [invisible carbon footprint] wouldn’t be a problem,” said the author of the report, John Barrett, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Leeds. “The UK should be showing leadership.” Policies to ensure that goods allowed to be imported had a lower carbon footprint – such as requirements on the efficiency, repairability and recycling of electric and electronic goods – could have a major impact on the invisible side of Britain’s carbon footprint, he added. Exporters would have an incentive to reduce their carbon footprint and the emissions associated with using their goods. Other changes to people’s habits could also bear fruit, for instance, encouraging a move to a healthier diet with more vegetables and less meat could change food imports and the carbon associated with them, said Barrett. The question of how to account for the emissions associated with imports is a vexed and polarising one, with some green campaigners arguing that developed countries should accept responsibility for emissions generated overseas, while other economists point out that the manufacturing countries have been paid for the goods. Josh Burke, a policy fellow at the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Using consumption accounting to understand trade flows is a useful exercise in light of the current global disruptions to supply chains and geopolitical tensions that have seen trade walls erected. Policies to shift consumption patterns and lower imports emissions – such as border carbon adjustments – are an elegant economic solution, based on equity and efficiency, rather than protectionism.” The EU is considering such border adjustments – in effect, carbon taxes on imports – to take into account the carbon generated by their manufacture, as part of its European green deal. But this is complex, said Burke. Such policies “tend to get bogged down in the politics of implementation and discussions often get sucked backed into protectionist agendas. As the UK begins to negotiate a raft of new free trade agreements, the optics of such a policy may in fact hinder international cooperation.” The UK will host the next UN climate talks, originally set for November in Glasgow but delayed to next year by the coronavirus crisis. This gives ministers the opportunity to encourage other countries to bring forward strong plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and to offer assistance to poor countries that could benefit by building their low-carbon export sectors, according to Stephen Cornelius, the chief climate adviser at WWF. “We should not be avoiding imports, but we should help other countries to reduce their carbon intensity,” he said. “The UK should work with other countries to bring forward high-ambition plans” under the Paris agreement. Barrett warned that ministers could be tempted, in drawing up plans for the economy to recover from the virus crisis, to pursue trade deals at any cost, without regard to their environmental impacts. “We have the option to improve standards, to encourage a low-carbon economy, or a race to the bottom,” he said. “That would undermine our environmental and social capital.” The UK’s domestic emissions fall under the Climate Change Act, under which the government must meet carbon budgets set out by the independent Committee on Climate Change several years in advance. The CCC has recommended that the UK continue to base its commitments on its “territorial” emissions, as this is the agreed international practice, but also keep track of emissions based on the consumption of goods from overseas and the implications of that trade."
"Britain’s energy-hungry population is highly dependent on oil and gas, which powers around two thirds of the UK’s energy needs. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) projects that by 2030, this proportion will not have changed much. But the source of that oil and gas is changing, and changing fast. In 2005, the UK was self-sufficient in both oil and gas, but now imports about one third of both. With North Sea production in steady decline, dependency on overseas suppliers is increasing: by 2020, three quarters of gas will be imported, mainly from Norway and Qatar. It is sobering that the journey from self-sufficiency to dependence on overseas suppliers will have taken the UK only 15 years, barely the time it takes to school the country’s citizens. The recent discovery and commercial exploitation of shale gas reserves has changed the petroleum landscape – at least, in the US. Over just the last twenty years, a blink of a geological eyelid, horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) of shale rocks underground has transformed the US petroleum landscape. In 2010 the US became a net exporter of petroleum products for the first time since World War II, with shale gas and oil contributing around US$100 billion per year to the US economy. Currently, the US is expanding its gas liquefaction facilities so that it can export more as liquid natural gas (LNG) to lucrative European and Asian markets. This is the backdrop to the two recent reports by the British Geological Survey (BGS) which give initial estimates of the amounts of shale oil in the Weald of southern England and shale gas in the Bowland shales of northern England. The Weald study covers parts of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire, from where small amounts of conventional oil have been produced for decades. The BGS estimated that there might be between 2.2-8.5 billion barrels of oil in place, with a central estimate of 4.4 billion barrels. A much more important question is how many of those 4.4 billion barrels might be recoverable. Experience from the US suggests that only 5% of the oil may be recoverable, even where the geology works well. But the Weald is not like the US best case scenario. Most of the rocks are richer in clay, which makes them difficult to frack effectively. They are also more highly faulted, which makes the geology more complicated. And most of the oil targeted in the US is very light, and so flows quite easily. In contrast, oil in the Weald is likely to be heavier, more viscous, and harder to extract. Since neither the rock nor the oil is of optimal quality in the Weald, we might estimate that only 1-2% might be recoverable. This would equate to 0.05-0.1 billion barrels, enough to meet just a few months of Britain’s energy demand. With 40 billion barrels already produced from the North Sea and another 20 billion still to come, the onshore prize seems very small. The gas story shows rather more promise, although we need more data before the true potential is understood. The BGS’s central estimate for total gas within the upper Bowland Shale, the most prospective unit, is 260 trillion cubic feet (tcf). If gas recovery rates are closer to 15%, as early US data suggest , the 39 tcf equates to 13 years of UK gas consumption – a more worthy prize. However, recovery of these volumes of gas rests on the very unlikely assumptions that all areas of the Bowland are as equally gas-rich and easily accessible for drilling. And it would require a huge escalation of onshore drilling. Production data over the past decade from the Barnett Shale in Texas suggests that an average of 1 billion cubic feet is produced from each well. Production of the full 39 tcf would thus require around 30,000 wells, unless average recovery rates can be improved. The industry’s ability to drill up to ten wells from a single site means that 3,000 sites would need to be scattered around the north of England. In comparison, the UK has drilled around 20 onshore oil and gas wells per year over the last century. Unlike the rest of Europe, the UK government has stated that it is determined to “go all out for shale”, with a package including tax incentives, changes to the trespass laws and financial benefits for local communities. But the required level of drilling can only occur if the legitimate worries of local communities are met. This will require strong and effective government regulation, together with an open and meaningful dialogue between industry and the communities in which it hopes to operate."

"**A Welsh railway immortalised by Thomas The Tank Engine's creator ""would get more generous Covid financial help if it was in England"", its boss has said.**
The Talyllyn Railway, where The Rev W Awdry volunteered, is one of Wales' ""iconic"" narrow gauge heritage lines that have been ""battered"" by Covid-19.
Passenger numbers and revenue has been hit and Welsh railways say lines in England have had more government help.
The Welsh Government has said Â£715,000 has gone to help historic railways.
Narrow gauge lines are synonymous with Wales and are among the most renowned in the world, attracting an estimated one million visitors a year to Wales and boosting the Welsh economy Â£55m annually.
Now all 11 Welsh historic railways would normally be full steam ahead for one of their busiest periods pre-Christmas.
But Santa specials and turkey and tinsel events have, by and large, been scuppered by the Covid-19 crisis as only two of 11 railways that make up the Great Little Trains of Wales organisation are putting on special events over the festive period, although some may still run restricted services.
It's a ""microcosm of a horrendous year"" which has seen some railways make people redundant and furlough most of their staff - while the hundreds of seasonal workers on those famous old lines haven't been needed.
Railways have been ""propped up"" by online donations, lottery grants or government help - but Welsh operators are frustrated as they say English railways can get more from the latest financial support than those in Wales.
Railways in England could apply for Â£1m as part of the UK Government's Â£1.57bn Cultural Recovery Fund, while some lines had almost Â£2m with extra arts assistance.
Operators in Wales say they could only bid for Â£150,000 in Welsh Government support although the government said the application process ""welcomed funding requests of up to Â£500,000.
The Talyllyn Railway in Gwynedd, where Thomas' creator The Rev W Awdry was a volunteer guard when it opened as the world's first preserved railway in 1951, was ""extremely grateful"" for its Â£150,000 government grant.
But after losing Â£670,000 or 60% of their year-on-year revenue, Talyllyn's general manager Stuart Williams said: ""I feel we would have got more generous Covid financial help if we were in England.
""This year has been a huge challenge. We raised Â£130,000 on virtual visits when we were shut and without that, we'd have been in trouble,"" added the vice-chairman of the Great Little Trains of Wales group.
About 50 miles north of the Talyllyn is one of Europe's biggest small railways whose revenue has nosedived from Â£6m to Â£1m as visitor numbers have tumbled from 220,00 to 30,000.
The Ffestiniog Railway - the world's first passenger-carrying narrow gauge railway - and its sister Welsh Highland Railway have this week made a third of their 97 staff redundant as their ""very painful"" year continues, with a warning they may be forced to close without further help.
The company which runs the two north Wales lines are yet to receive their Â£150,000 grant but their general manager says the amount ""pales to insignificance compared with the problem having lost Â£5m worth of income"".
""We can save costs but we need Â£2m worth of funding to keep on top of the game so we can open ready to go at Easter 2021,"" said boss Paul Lewin.
""If you go over the border to England and see Department for Culture, Media and Sport have funded the North Yorkshire Railway to the tune of Â£1.94m and Â£900,000 to the Severn Valley Railway.
""If we were a different size business to them, I could understand but we're not - we're the largest heritage railway in the country and North Yorks and Severn Valley are both Â£6m-Â£7m turnover companies like ourselves - and they have been supported and will carry on.
""We've just had a little bit of help which we are grateful for but now we've had to make 32 people redundant, on top of about 50 seasonal posts.
""That's 80 people that have been affected and we're trying to survive through winter with a minimal workforce and eek cash out long enough to run next year.""
Prince has steamed along the 13-and-a-half mile (21.7 km) between Porthmadog and Blaenau Ffestiniog since the Ffestiniog Railway became the world's first passenger-carrying narrow gauge railway in 1865.
He is one of 13 locomotives in their shed and shutting down steam railways are ""not an option"" as engines, track, bridges and cuttings require ""constant maintenance"" - especially when some of the engines are more than 150 years old.
""It costs about Â£200,000 a month to keep up our mandatory maintenance,"" added Mr Lewin.
""My disappointment is the Welsh Government have overlooked Welsh railways and which underpin our tourism industry.""
In comparison, arts organisations across Wales have shared Â£27.5m of the Welsh Government's Â£63m Cultural Recovery Fund to survive the pandemic, with some venues getting more than Â£500,000 - with Â£3.4m going to the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay.
The Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland, which had Â£550,000 of online donations, and the Talyllyn Railway are part of Gwynedd's bid to become a Unesco world heritage site.
""We are in a charge of an important piece of Welsh history, "" added Mr Lewin.
""The Ffestiniog Railway is an incredible survivor and looks like it did 150 years ago. This is a living piece of Welsh heritage we're preserving for the nation, not by grants but by paying its own way as being a tourist attraction.
""We're not some flash in the pan tourist attraction, we've been a very important staple for 60 years, bringing income, jobs and tourists to the area - and I think that warrants some respect and attention and wouldn't it be a shame something that has delivered so much is overlooked.
""We are always looking at how long we can survive. With the redundancies we can survive until next summer but we're banking on a good trade in early spring and summer.""
The Welsh Government has it has allocated ""more than Â£30 million"" from their Â£63m cultural recovery fund to ""provide essential support to organisations and individuals across Wales, including a total of Â£715k so far for historic railways."""

At Wednesday’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Vanessa Hauc of Telemundo asked former Vice President Joe Biden about his expressed desire to “hold oil and gas executives accountable for their role in harming our planet. You have even suggested that you might put them in jail.”



Biden dodged in his answer, but Vox has now put out a roundup of the Democratic candidates’ published views on prosecuting fossil fuel executives. It’s worth a look.



To begin with the more normal responses, candidates Mike Bloomberg, Joe Biden, and Pete Buttigieg all basically promise stepped‐​up enforcement of existing laws, with Bloomberg additionally saying he will “strengthen rules” allowing the Department of Justice to bring criminal cases, and Biden saying he will “seek additional legislation as needed to hold corporate executives personally accountable—including jail time where merited.” Elizabeth Warren repeats her proposal—which I’ve criticized in some detail—for new legislation attaching criminal liability to negligence that leads to “severe harm.”



Bernie Sanders has never cut his ties to a branch of the socialist tradition in which the conviction gets settled first and the law is discovered afterward.



What about the idea that advocacy on the wrong side of climate debates should carry legal consequences? In a brief—but disturbing—reference, Sen. Amy Klobuchar favors holding “companies accountable for their … campaigns to mislead the public.” Justice Stephen Breyer, in _Nike_ v. _Kasky_ , rightly called out schemes to impose liability on businesses for promoting faulty public policy views as inconsistent with the First Amendment.



But at least Klobuchar doesn’t seem to be promoting the idea of _criminal_ liability—a difference as big as that between “Sue her!” and “Lock her up!”



Some Senate Democrats, however (as well as some other officials), do seem to be interested in applying criminal law to “wrongful advocacy” by businesses—or even by nonprofits and university scholars.



Sometimes they reach for stretchy theories of conspiracy or “racketeering” to achieve this purpose, or, as in New York, see it as securities fraud (a theory that crashed and burned big time in New York’s Exxon prosecution last December). For years now, proposals have circulated to make the denial of climate change consensus a criminal matter, perhaps as a “crime against humanity.” Tom Steyer might be on this page, calling for “real—potentially criminal—consequences for actions [executives] may have taken to _knowingly_ _spread false information and slow climate action_.” The emphasis here is added because the qualifiers— “knowingly,” “false,” “slow,” and “action”—are so nebulous that it’s impossible to know what Steyer really means. It’s possible that he has no idea, either.



But in a class by himself is Bernie Sanders.



Sanders has repeatedly sounded variations on the theme: “Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused.”



He does not say what criminal law he thinks they have broken, despite the plain current legality under current law of operating refineries, at‐​pump gas sales and so forth. But note that Sanders’ language is not forward-looking—it’s retrospective. He’s not just talking about passing some new law and then arresting executives who proceed to violate it. He is talking about prosecuting past lawful behavior.



It’s a reminder that for all his talk of Denmark‐​this and Sweden‐​that, Bernie Sanders has never cut his ties to a branch of the socialist tradition in which the conviction gets settled first and the law is discovered afterward.



America needs a politics with fewer authoritarian impulses, not more.

Nearly a week has passed since the Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction against President Obama’s executive action on immigration, known as DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans). After digesting the 70‐​page majority opinion and 54‐​page dissent (plus the 11‐​page DAPA memo that’s an appendix), I can say that there aren’t any real surprises but we should keep in mind the following points as this case moves forward to the Supreme Court:



1\. Standing is very important. Have the plaintiffs been hurt by the federal action in a way that gets them into court? If the 26 states simply don’t like President Obama’s policy, that isn’t enough. Both the Fifth Circuit and the district court accepted Texas’s argument that DAPA would force the state to incur the cost of issuing driver’s licenses, which is indeed a direct cost of an executive decision that expands eligibility for various state benefits. Ironically, one of the key precedents supporting the argument for state standing is _Massachusetts v. EPA_ (2007), which found states to have standing to challenge the Bush‐​era EPA on climate‐​change (in)actions because, roughly speaking, their coastlines are eroding. Texas’s claim of harm here, if anything, seems stronger and less nebulous.



2\. “Justiciability” is similarly crucial. (Indeed, it takes more than half the majority opinion to get past these “threshold” matters.) That is, even if the state plaintiffs are hurt such that they have standing, if a court can’t adjudicate the dispute–because, say, there’s an exercise of prosecutorial discretion that courts don’t review–then the case should be dismissed as “non‐​justiciable” (as the dissent argues). This is likely to be the point on which the case will ultimately turn; just look at the administration’s immediate reaction:



The Department of Justice remains committed to taking steps that will resolve the immigration litigation as quickly as possible in order to allow DHS to bring greater accountability to our immigration system by _prioritizing the removal of the worst offenders_ , not people who have long ties to the United States and who are raising American children.



But the lawsuit doesn’t challenge the ability of government to prioritize the deportation of human traffickers over nannies–and indeed immigration authorities have been doing that since time immemorial. Can you shoehorn an entirely new federal program/​benefit into that uncontroversial enforcement discretion?



3\. The appellate court didn’t simply affirm the district court’s finding that the executive action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, but also added a further justification, that DAPA exceeds the executive’s statutory authority. If the Supreme Court ends up leaving the injunction in place, it doesn’t much matter for practical purposes whether it does so because (a) the administration violated the APA by not engaging in notice‐​and‐​comment rulemaking, (b) it doesn’t have the legal authority under the relevant immigration laws, or (c) it exceeds the president’s power under Article II’s Take Care Clause (as Cato argues in our amicus brief). The district judge focused entirely on the first (administrative) point, with which the Fifth Circuit agreed but then went on to provide an alternative holding on the second (statutory) point. And the third (constitutional) point looms atmospherically in the background.



For more detailed examinations of the Fifth Circuit ruling, see Josh Blackman’s diligent series of posts on standing, justiciability, the procedural claim, the substantive claim, the dissenting opinion generally and on standing and justiciability.



So where do we go from here? The Supreme Court is certain to take the case, but the question is when. Recent practice suggests that for the case to be heard this term, the Court must be in a position to “conference” the case by the end of January. That means that all the briefing must be complete in time for consideration by the justices and their clerks a little before that. SCOTUSblog’s sources indicate that we can expect the government to file a cert petition by the end of the week. Texas will then have 30 days to reply. The government will probably discourage its amici from filing briefs because that would give Texas reason to ask for a 30‐​day extension on its deadline–but Texas could ask for that extension regardless, and the Court grants such requests as a matter of course.



But the government may not actually be in such a hurry. Earlier this year, it delayed in filing its “emergency” motion to stay the district court’s February ruling, and then it took a while to decide how to respond to the Fifth Circuit’s denial of that motion, ultimately deciding against seeking Supreme Court review at that stage. So it could be that for either political or legal reasons–because it’s unsure or dubious of whether it will find five votes at the high court–it won’t mind having _Texas v. United States_ pushed into the next term.



That would keep the case alive through the presidential election. Hillary Clinton’s response on this issue at the Democratic debate Saturday night was muddled–she thought that the government had already appealed and claimed that DAPA covered the parents of so‐​called DREAMers, which it doesn’t (because the president’s own legal advisers said he couldn’t go that far)–but she has said previously that she would expand on President Obama’s actions.



And, of course, if a Republican wins the White House, he or she could withdraw the DAPA memo, thereby ending the program and mooting the case. Stay tuned.

From the International Council for Science,  something for the beleaguered climate science community to consider.
Responsibilities of scientists underlined by scientific community
Rome, Italy – The General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU) today reaffirmed the universal values that should guide the conduct of science. It explicitly recognized the key social responsibilities of the scientific community that need to accompany the free practice of science. While the focus of the Principle of Universality of Science – which is central to ICSU’s statutes and a basic condition of worldwide membership of the ICSU family – has been on the preservation of scientific freedoms, ICSU is mindful of the need for scientists to pay equal attention to their responsibilities.
“The balance between scientific freedom and responsibility is not always easy to get right, but awareness of its significance and of the value of ongoing dialogue must be maintained within the scientific community.” says Bengt Gustafsson, Chair of ICSU’s Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS). “By extending its consideration of the long-established Principle of the Universality to explicitly include responsibilities as well as freedoms, ICSU has emphasized that this balance is critical both for science and society.”
The new wording of the Principle was approved today by the membership of ICSU at its General Assembly in Rome. It reads as follows:
The Principle of Universality (freedom and responsibility) of Science
The free and responsible practice of science is fundamental to scientific advancement and human and environmental well-being. Such practice, in all its aspects, requires freedom of movement, association, expression and communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information, and other resources for research. It requires responsibility at all levels to carry out and communicate scientific work with integrity, respect, fairness, trustworthiness, and transparency, recognising its benefits and possible harms.
In advocating the free and responsible practice of science, ICSU promotes equitable opportunities for access to science and its benefits, and opposes discrimination based on such factors as ethnic origin, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or age.
Promoting good scientific conduct and preventing misconduct is critical for science as a whole, and for this reason ICSU’s CFRS was also heavily engaged in the organization of the second World Conference on Research Integrity in Singapore in July 2010. The Singapore Statement on Research Integrity, which stemmed from the event, was presented to the Assembly in Rome. The statement emphasizes the need for honesty in all aspects of research, accountability in the conduct of scientific research, professional courtesy and fairness in working with others, and good stewardship of research on behalf of others.
Gustafsson adds: “As our world evolves, there are continually changing challenges to the freedoms of scientists, and an increased onus on the scientific community to articulate and embrace its responsibilities. Whilst there can be national, and even disciplinary, differences in the way research is actually carried out, there are certain principles and responsibilities that are fundamental to ‘good science’. Given the unique position of scientists as the gate-keepers of new knowledge in today’s knowledge societies, respect for these values is critically important if confidence in science is to be maintained.”
###About ICSU
Founded in 1931, ICSU is a non-governmental organization with a global membership of national scientific bodies (120 Members, representing 140 countries) and International Scientific Unions (30 Members). The Council’s activities focus on three areas: planning and coordinating research; science for policy; and strengthening the Universality of Science. ICSU is frequently called upon to speak on behalf of the global scientific community and to act as an advisor in matters ranging from the environment to conduct in science. www.icsu.org

That is effectively what coastal residents around New Zealand are being told by their Local Authorities as councils get their big red pens out and draw lines on ‘hazard’ maps and attach notes to LIMs.



Way back in 2008, the Ministry for the Environment used 2007 data to make up some numbers:



And then local councils were tasked with plotting this nonsense on their hazard maps. Speaking from experience, once there is a line like this on your property LIM **it is very difficult to get insurance.** If a purchaser needs a mortgage they cannot get one as banks etc require a property to be insured before granting a mortgage. No insurance = no mortgage = no sale. **You are sitting on an unsaleable, uninsurable asset.**



Instead of a model created 12 years ago, why not use some up-to-date real-world data? 



A [2019 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567) of the most reliable tide gauges in the world, with more than 100 years of good quality data found 76 that matched that benchmark. One was in New Zealand. It was the Dunedin gauge, a city where 3604 homes, 185 businesses and 72km of roads are going to drown according to the alarmists.



What did the long term tide gauge records say? Some were up, some were down. The world average was 0.337mm/yr and the acceleration was 0.007mm/yr2.



Dunedin was above average at 1.325mm/yr with an acceleration of 0.01775mm/yr2.



If you remember the equations of motion from school; the distance over time equation is: s = ut + 1/2at2. Distance = s, current velocity is u, acceleration is a and time is t.



The typical figures being used by Local Authorities, based on central government advice is 400 – 600mm sea level rise by 2080 and 800 – 1600mm sea level rise by 2130.



Using the formula above, with the actual historical data and projecting out to 2080 and 2130 the sea level rise will be:



World average: 33.58 and 80.53mm (compare 400/600 and 800/1600)  
Dunedin: 113.85 and 254.42mm (compare 400/600 and 800/1600)



At the current rate, it will **343 years before** there is 150cm of sea-level rise in Dunedin, not really a climate emergency that needs a line on property LIMs just yet.



Tasman is the latest area to hit the headlines with this stupidity.



About 5500 letters from Tasman District Council are expected to arrive this week in the mailboxes of people whose properties have been identified as potentially at risk. Those properties are within or partially within areas affected by a range of sea level rise scenarios on new council coastal hazard maps, scheduled to be available on the council website from Monday.



The maps show areas of low-lying land and how it may be affected by sea level rise scenarios in half-metre increments, from **0.5 metres to 2m**. They also show the effect of a higher tides caused by storms. Areas of coastal erosion and sediment gain have been mapped along with structures such as stopbanks, walls and rock revetments.

"**A council has defended plans for a scaled-down Christmas market despite residents saying it is irresponsible as the city heads into tier three.**
The market in Nottingham city centre will go ahead this year featuring a big wheel, rides and 40 stalls.
The city council said the event - which will run from 5 to 24 December - was important for local people and the economy and could be done safely.
But some residents said they did not think the event should go ahead.
Nottingham City Council said events like the market, which will be open from 10:00 to 21:00 GMT every day, can go ahead under government guidelines.
It said it would be half its usual size, would not have an ice rink this year and no stalls would sell alcohol.
The council said the rides had been risk assessed and parts of the Old Market Square would be shut if they got too busy.
However, Janet Poundall, 62, from Underwood, Nottinghamshire, said she believed the council's decision was ""irresponsible"".
She said: ""The council are encouraging people to come into Nottingham and how are they going to get here? On public transport.
""I don't want to risk staying in tier three for a helter-skelter and a German sausage.""
Veronica Sutcliffe, from Giltbrook, said she was ""incensed"" when she heard about the plans.
""I think it is foolhardy to do this,"" she said.
""People will flock there, it will attract crowds and the sacrifices we have all made will be trampled underfoot. Whoever agreed to this needs a sharp lesson in the stark reality of Covid-19.""
Emma Cowland, 44, from Tollerton, called the Christmas market plans a ""joke"".
She added: ""[This can happen] yet our local pub, who have all the Covid guidelines in place, isn't allowed to open to serve outside? This is absolutely absurd.""
However, other residents backed the idea.
Kerry Machin, 36, from Beeston, said she was excited to take her children for a bit of ""normality and Christmas cheer"".
She added: ""I'm sure the businesses who rely on markets like this for their income will be so happy.""
Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood also defended the plans for the market, pointing out non-essential shops would be allowed to reopen and an outdoor alternative ""might be safer"".
Nottingham and Nottinghamshire are re-entering tier three from 2 December, meaning no households can mix indoors or in private gardens. Pubs and restaurants will have to stay closed and people should not travel in or out of the area.
It comes despite the city's infection rate dropping sharply, from the worst in England at points last month to 185.6 per 100,000 in the week leading up to 23 November, according to government figures.
In a statement addressing concerns of residents on social media, the city council said: ""We fully understand that giving the go-ahead for an event this year is an emotive issue.
""We've taken great care in considering Christmas plans for Nottingham this year.
""We hope the market, along with plans to extend opening times in the city centre to stagger shoppers throughout the day, will provide an environment for people to feel festive, support local businesses and, most importantly, stay safe and have a wonderful Christmas.""

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.



Prior to April, 2011, issues of this Wisdom, which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





Boston University’s Robert Kaufmann and colleagues recently published a paper in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ examining the causes of the recent dearth of “global warming.” They concluded that it’s simply natural variability, augmented by increasing sulfate emissions from dramatically growing coal consumption by China. 



Of course, it is the latter conclusion that has drawn all the attention, for it allows the possibility that greenhouse gases are continuing to impart an as‐​expected warming influence on the global climate. And then once China gets its air pollution under control (and we are talking about true air pollution here, i.e., _not_ carbon dioxide), global temperatures will rise rapidly. Thus the dream of alarming climate change lives.



If China’s sulfate emissions are not having much of an impact of global temperatures, then, the dearth of warming in recent years supports the hypothesis — now made by many (unpopular) folks in the climate business — that the “sensitivity” of temperature to carbon dioxide has been guessed (we choose our words carefully here) to be too high by climate modelers. In this scenario, we wake up from the alarmist nightmare and resume our normal lives. 



There are two reasons why we think it is wrong for Kaufmann _et al._ to attribute a reduced rate of global warming to Chinese sulfates:



1) China’s cooling sulfates do not readily make their way into the Southern Hemisphere, yet, from 1999–2010, temperatures actually fell there, while they rose in the Northern Hemisphere. This is exactly the opposite of what should have happened if sulfates are exerting a relative cooling primarily in the Northern Hemisphere



2) Chinese coal consumption increased in 2009 and 2010 (in fact, 2010 had the biggest year‐​over‐​year increase recorded) — yet, the global temperature rose sharply in 2009 and in 2010. Because Kaufmann’s climate model responds instantaneously to sulfates (as opposed to a decades‐​long lag to adjust to carbon dioxide changes) this is contrary to his hypothesis. 



Let’s look at the first one. 



The link below shows the march of weather systems around the globe for several months. Notice that the weather systems passing through China quickly move into the north Pacific Ocean, and don’t mix into the Southern Hemisphere. Since sulfates only have an atmospheric lifetime of about a week or so, they are hard pressed to cause any cooling impact beyond the areas to the immediate east of China.



So, if a dramatic increase in Chinese sulfur emissions during the past decade or so has been responsible for the observed slowdown in the rate of _global_ temperature increase, then the Northern Hemisphere should be doing most of the work — that is, the rate of warming in the Northern Hemisphere should have slowed by much more than the rate of warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This situation is easy to check.



Figure 1 shows the Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperature history from 1980 through 2010 according to the surface temperature data set compiled and maintained by the _Climate Research_ Unit at the University of East Anglia. During the period of time during which Chinese sulfate emissions rose (1998–2010), the warming in the Southern Hemisphere went negative (i.e. became a cooling) while the Northern Hemisphere warmed. From Figure 1 it is obvious that the Southern Hemisphere is driving the global temperature slowdown, not the Northern — a result completely contrary to Kaufmann _et al._ ‘s Chinese sulfate hypothesis.





Now let’s turn to our Reason #2. Simply put, during the past 2 years (which were not part of the Kaufmann _et al._ dataset), global temperatures rose _as did Chinese coal consumption_. According to Kaufmann _et al._ ‘s hypothesis, the increase in Chinese coal consumption should act to drive down the rate of global temperature rise, but that is not what happened. Again, temperatures are behaving in an opposite fashion, compared to what the hypothesis predicts. 



The top panel in Figure 2 shows Chinese coal consumption from the BP Statistical Review of World Energy from 1998 through 2010. Notice that it increased substantially in both 2009 and 2010 — two years not included in the Kaufmann _et al._ analysis. The year‐​over‐​year increase from 2009 to 2010 was the highest annual increase on record. If Chinese coal consumption were having a large impact on global temperature, we would expect that global temperatures would remain suppressed in 2009 and 2010. But the bottom panel in Figure 2 shows what really happened — global temperatures rose in both 2009 and 2010, contrary to the Kaufmann _et al._ hypothesis.







It is clear that natural variability, not sulfate emissions, is the cause of the lack of recent warming. We arrived at this very same conclusion several years ago, however, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to find a journal even interested in _considering_ our work for publication.



Our analysis was remarkably similar to Kaufmann’s:





Our paper (2008):  




The only difference between the manuscripts was Kaufmann’s unsupportable hypothesis that Chinese sulfate emissions also contributed to the lack of warming. 



Our experience with the peer‐​review process was a nightmare that eerily resembles what University of Guelph’s Ross McKitrick describes in his chapter “Bias in the Peer‐​Review Process,” in my new book, _Climate Coup_.



We started with the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) publication _EOS, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union_. After sitting on the paper for several months (which included getting a review or two), the _EOS_ editors told us that we had too much “new” science in our piece and that _EOS_ was more of a news publication and that they’d be happy to consider publishing a description of our work after it was published elsewhere:



Here is a review that they got concerning our submission:





And here is their final decision:





OK, fine. Since the paper describing our original model (Michaels and Knappenberger, 2000) was published in another AGU publication, _Geophysical Research Letters_ , we figured we submit our new paper there, after expanding the piece from the original _EOS_ submission to a paper more appropriate for _GRL_. In our cover letter to _GRL_ , we included our full set of correspondence with the editors of _EOS_ , and explained how _EOS_ was potentially interested in our findings, but considered there to be too much “new” science for it to be published there. We also included the reviewer’s comments that _Eos_ had obtained (and reproduced above) including “ _Eos_ readership would find the overall argument interesting, especially from the 2nd author.”



Here is what we got back from the _GRL_ editor, one day after submission:





Interesting. Too much new science for one AGU publication, too little for another.



So we turned to a journal which has a section dedicated to short science pieces with broad interest — we reworked our article and submitted it as a Brevia piece to _Science_ magazine. 



A week later we got this:





Well, we figured _Science_ was a long shot.



At the same time, we had received several emails soliciting/​inviting us to submit a paper to a new journal titled _Advance in Meteorology_ — a journal that was looking for content to get it off the ground:





We figured, we had a paper basically ready to go for them. So, we redrafted it to fit the submission guideline to _Advance in Meteorology_ , and sent it off. 



About a week later we got this:





Ok, well, at least we got some scientific feedback, all of which was irrelevant. Our empirical model was built using monthly data over a time period of 20 years, fit the observed temperatures pretty well (the explained variance was about 60%) and it had already been published in _Geophysical Research Letters_. We were merely using it to understand the recent lack of warming. 



Before giving up completely, we thought that we’d give it on more go, this time at the journal _Climate Research_ , where we had published a half dozen or more papers in the past. About a week after submission, we got this response:





Climate Research was the journal that the climategaters particularly hated. They hatched plans to destroy it every time it published something they didn’t like, and I am sure these leaked all over the porous world of climate science. Perhaps their campaign worked. 



We don’t know how to explain the glib acceptance of a very similar paper in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ (with the exception of the obviously wrong hypothesis about Chinese sulfates), and our going 0‐​for‐​5. But that is the way it is.

White Coke Cans Fund Polar Bear Myths

Guest post by by Paul Chesser

For years Coca-Cola has given millions of dollars to eco-extreme group World Wildlife Fund, whose alarmism and perpetration of falsehoods are unmatched among its cohorts in climate activism. Now Coke has initiated a new campaign with WWF that features its iconic advertising species in an effort to drive more funding to the international nonprofit group to “protect the polar bears’ Arctic home.”
The promotion will include new packaging for Coke over the holiday season, changing its familiar red cans to white, and featuring an image of a mother polar bear and her cubs on the side. Coke says it will donate $2 million over five years to WWF for “polar bear conservation efforts,” and will also match donations made at iCoke.ca. Last year Coke gave WWF $1.64 million for its various activities globally.

“The planet is changing very quickly, and nowhere more quickly than in the Arctic,” says Gerald Butts, president of WWF-Canada.
“It’s really important that we all understand that they need our help,” he added. “Climate change is changing livelihoods, it’s changing migration patterns for species, and we want to plan ahead. We want a future for the Arctic where the communities of people who live there are vibrant and sustainable, and the iconic species – in particular the polar bear – has a long-term future on the planet.”
Butts speaks so little truth.

Again, forget all the tall tales from IPCC scientist Mojib Latif and Met Office meteorologist David Viner. (Latif has been on the radio trying to convince listeners that the record cold March “is normal”. What a joke.)
Just a couple hours ago, Germany’s leading daily, Bild, which has a circulation in the millions, writes online here that German meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net presents the records for this “seemingly eternally long winter”.
But first, Bild tells its millions of readers in the article (my emphasis):
With regards to the period 1981 to 2010, it was the fifth winter in a row that has been colder than normal, which is in complete contradiction to the climate prognoses of 13 years ago. Back then winters with snow and ice in Germany were viewed as an obsolete model.”
There it is – Germany’s number 1 media outlet tells millions that the climate models are crap! Now some of the records Bild reports on:
– March in Germany will enter the record books as the coldest in 100 years…4°C colder than normal!
– At 28 cm, Hamburg saw the most snow in March since measurements began!
– Dresden saw the lowest temperature for this time of the year since 1917!
– Potsdam, the home of the warming-obsessed PIK, saw the lowest reading for this time of the year since measurements began in 1899!

"Even as the coronavirus pandemic terrorizes the world, there’s another global emergency the media can’t afford to stop covering. Fifty years ago this week, the environmental movement staged the first Earth Day demonstration to call attention to environmental degradation and demand reform. In the half century since, climate change has emerged as an existential global threat.  But there are still reasons to be hopeful – and this week, the Guardian is joining forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency, from electric cars to fighting plastic waste to using psychedelic drugs. (Michael Pollan will weigh in.) We’ll also explore lessons from the coronavirus pandemic – and whether the economic crash could create opportunities to rebuild a greener economy. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded last year by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation to address the urgent need for stronger climate coverage. More than 400 newsrooms from around the world – with a combined audience nearing 2 billion people – have signed on. In the coming days, the Covering Climate Now partners will collectively publish hundreds of stories on climate solutions to create a groundswell of hope at a moment when the world feels bleak. Throughout the week, we’ll be sharing Guardian content with CCN partners for republishing, so that even outlets without dedicated environmental reporters can inform their audiences of the dangers of the climate crisis and opportunities for change. Covering Climate Now has provided financial support for some of our climate reporting this week. The Covering Climate Now network represents every corner of the media, from wire services like Reuters and AFP to newspapers like the Times of India and the Christian Science Monitor, and dozens of local and special-interest outlets, across all mediums, from across the US and world. The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. This year, the Guardian announced it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies, becoming the first major global news organization to institute an outright ban on taking money from companies that extract fossil fuels. Last year, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce new terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favors the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” over “climate change”. The Guardian last year also began putting global CO2 levels in the daily weather forecast in its print publication. Covering Climate Now was launched to address a glaring failure by the media to meet the urgency of the climate emergency. Kyle Pope, CCN co-founder and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, writes that in 2018, “broadcast news outlets gave more airtime to the royal baby than to the warming earth”. In 2019, that started to change. “The climate story seemed to be moving from slow to fast, as the effects of the crisis were becoming impossible for even the most stubborn newsrooms to ignore,” Pope writes. “Floods in Venice and droughts in India were ready-made for the evening news. Devastating fires in California and Australia led news broadcasts around the world. Mass protests and their student leaders adorned magazine covers.” While the project began in the US, Covering Climate Now has quickly gained traction globally and now includes dozens of international news organizations and coverage in multiple languages.

Senator Inhofe’s EPW office issued a press release today on the subject of USHCN Climate Monitoring stations along with links to this report from the General Accounting Office (GAO)
…the report notes, “NOAA does not centrally track whether USHCN stations adhere to siting standards…nor does it have an agency-wide policy regarding stations that don’t meet standards.” The report continues, “Many of the USHCN stations have incomplete temperature records; very few have complete records. 24 of the 1,218 stations (about 2 percent) have complete data from the time they were established.” GAO goes on to state that most stations with long temperature records are likely to have undergone multiple changes in measurement conditions.
The report  shows by their methodology that 42% of the network in 2010 failed to meet siting standards and they have recommendations to NOAA for solving this problem. This number is of course much lower than what we have found in the surfacestations.org survey, but bear in mind that NOAA has been slowly and systematically following my lead and reports and closing the worst stations or removing them from USHCN duty. For example I pointed out that the famous Marysville station (see An old friend put out to pasture: Marysville is no longer a USHCN climate station of record) that started all this was closed just a few months after I reported issues with its atrocious siting. Recent discoveries of closures include Armore (shown below) and Durant OK. This may account for a portion the lower 42% figure for “active stations” the GAO found. Another reason might be that they tended towards using a less exacting rating system than we did.
Recently, while resurveying stations that I previously surveyed in Oklahoma, I discovered that NOAA has been quietly removing the temperature sensors from some of the USHCN stations we cited as the worst (CRN4, 5) offenders of siting quality. For example, here are before and after photographs of the USHCN temperature station in Ardmore, OK, within a few feet of the traffic intersection at City Hall:
Ardmore USHCN station , MMTS temperature sensor, January 2009 

Ardmore USHCN station , MMTS temperature sensor removed, March 2011
While NCDC has gone to great lengths to defend the quality of the USHCN network, their actions of closing them speak far louder than written words and peer reviewed publications.
I don’t have time today to go into detail, but will follow up at another time. Here is the GAO summary:
Climate Monitoring: NOAA Can Improve Management of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network
GAO-11-800 August 31, 2011
Highlights Page (PDF)   Full Report (PDF, 47 pages)   Accessible Text   Recommendations (HTML)
Summary
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains a network of weather-monitoring stations known as the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN), which monitors the nation’s climate and analyzes long-term surface temperature trends. Recent reports have shown that some stations in the USHCN are not sited in accordance with NOAA’s standards, which state that temperature instruments should be located away from extensive paved surfaces or obstructions such as buildings and trees. GAO was asked to examine (1) how NOAA chose stations for the USHCN, (2) the extent to which these stations meet siting standards and other requirements, and (3) the extent to which NOAA tracks USHCN stations’ adherence to siting standards and other requirements and has established a policy for addressing nonadherence to siting standards. GAO reviewed data and documents, interviewed key NOAA officials, surveyed the 116 NOAA weather forecast offices responsible for managing stations in the USHCN, and visited 8 forecast offices.
In choosing USHCN stations from a larger set of existing weather-monitoring stations, NOAA placed a high priority on achieving a relatively uniform geographic distribution of stations across the contiguous 48 states. NOAA balanced geographic distribution with other factors, including a desire for a long history of temperature records, limited periods of missing data, and stability of a station’s location and other measurement conditions, since changes in such conditions can cause temperature shifts unrelated to climate trends. NOAA had to make certain exceptions, such as including many stations that had incomplete temperature records. In general, the extent to which the stations met NOAA’s siting standards played a limited role in the designation process, in part because NOAA officials considered other factors, such as geographic distribution and a long history of records, to be more important. USHCN stations meet NOAA’s siting standards and management requirements to varying degrees. According to GAO’s survey of weather forecast offices, about 42 percent of the active stations in 2010 did not meet one or more of the siting standards.
With regard to management requirements, GAO found that the weather forecast offices had generally but not always met the requirements to conduct annual station inspections and to update station records. NOAA officials told GAO that it is important to annually visit stations and keep records up to date, including siting conditions, so that NOAA and other users of the data know the conditions under which they were recorded. NOAA officials identified a variety of challenges that contribute to some stations not adhering to siting standards and management requirements, including the use of temperature-measuring equipment that is connected by a cable to an indoor readout device–which can require installing equipment closer to buildings than specified in the siting standards. NOAA does not centrally track whether USHCN stations adhere to siting standards and the requirement to update station records, and it does not have an agencywide policy regarding stations that do not meet its siting standards. Performance management guidelines call for using performance information to assess program results. NOAA’s information systems, however, are not designed to centrally track whether stations in the USHCN meet its siting standards or the requirement to update station records. Without centrally available information, NOAA cannot easily measure the performance of the USHCN in meeting siting standards and management requirements.
Furthermore, federal internal control standards call for agencies to document their policies and procedures to help managers achieve desired results. NOAA has not developed an agencywide policy, however, that clarifies for agency staff whether stations that do not adhere to siting standards should remain open because the continuity of the data is important, or should be moved or closed. As a result, weather forecast offices do not have a basis for making consistent decisions to address stations that do not meet the siting standards. GAO recommends that NOAA enhance its information systems to centrally capture information useful in managing the USHCN and develop a policy on how to address stations that do not meet its siting standards. NOAA agreed with GAO’s recommendations.

The European Energy Review has a review of Dieter Helm’s new book “The Carbon Crunch“, read here (scroll down to: Dieter Helm’s new thriller separates climate fiction from fact). 
According to the EER, Helm is one of the most famous energy economists in Europe – a professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford and a fellow in Economics at New College, Oxford. He has also served as special advisor to the UK government and to the European Commission.
It’s another recently published book criticizing climate science and policy by a high profile author in Europe.
EER writes (emphasis added):
Dieter Helm’s new book “The Carbon Crunch” reads a bit like a detective novel. It is about ‘who killed climate policy’. And how we can revive the corpse.
He starts his story with the stark observation that international climate policy, led by the EU as self-styled climate frontrunner, is an outright failure. The endless UN climate conferences and the famous Kyoto treaty are not delivering the goods. Neither is the EU Emission Trading Scheme. Moreover, what is worse, climate as a public concern is sliding down the political agenda. Clearly, something must be done – and done quickly – to stave off disaster.
Well, disaster? Is climate change really the threat that many people say it is? Helm notes that the public has become more sceptical in this regard – or more fatalistic, with the same effect. To his credit, he does not blame the “climate sceptics” or ExxonMobil for this. On the contrary, ‘green’ NGO’s and climate scientists deserve a lot of the blame, as they are frequently guilty of alarmist predictions and pretending to be certain about inherently uncertain things.”
So like Hans von Storch, Dieter Helm is also convinced that climate policy is dead and that the science is hyped up.
On solar and wind projects in Europe as a solution to pollution by coal, Helm tells us the policies to promote renewable energies  (sun and wind) have been a disaster:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




This is so much money wasted. These policies allow European politicians to grandstand about how brilliantly Europe is limiting its emissions, but they do not have any significant effect on the climate.
Grandstanding? Isn’t that precisely what Obama wants to do now? He may want to reconsider about getting in on the folly.
And Helm tells us how that Europe is cheating with its carbon bookkeeping:
The EU may be limiting its emissions from carbon production, but this is because European industrial production has shifted to a considerable extent to Asia – and the EU does of course import Asian products for its consumption. So what really counts is not so much carbon production, but carbon consumption. In the UK, for example, notes Helm, carbon production went down 15% between 1990 and 2005, but carbon consumption went up 19%!”
Helm, a warmist, also admits that going green does mean pain, and there is no denying it. EER writes…
Helm is at least honest enough not to pretend that climate policy is somehow going to be effective without economic sacrifices. Any solution will hurt, no matter how much politicians prattle about “green growth”.  […] Whether political leaders will be able to persuade people to shed ‘blood, sweat and tears’ in this cause, is the big question. They could at least start by reading this book.”

From the University of Southern California  a parallel for Alfred Nobel’s design of a stable substrate for dynamite (which at the time used unstable nitro-glycerin). This solves the collision problem for automobile mounted fuel cells.
Breakthrough in hydrogen fuel cells
USC chemists develop way to safely store, extract hydrogen
A team of USC scientists has developed a robust, efficient method of using hydrogen as a fuel source.
Hydrogen makes a great fuel because of it can easily be converted to electricity in a fuel cell and because it is carbon free. The downside of hydrogen is that, because it is a gas, it can only be stored in high pressure or cryogenic tanks.
In a vehicle with a tank full of hydrogen, “if you got into a wreck, you’d have a problem,” said Travis Williams, assistant professor of chemistry at the USC Dornsife College.

A possible solution is to store hydrogen in a safe chemical form. Earlier this year, Williams and his team figured out a way to release hydrogen from an innocuous chemical material — a nitrogen-boron complex, ammonia borane — that can be stored as a stable solid.
Now the team has developed a catalyst system that releases enough hydrogen from its storage in ammonia borane to make it usable as a fuel source. Moreover, the system is air-stable and re-usable, unlike other systems for hydrogen storage on boron and metal hydrides.
The research was published this month in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
“Ours is the first game in town for reusable, air stabile ammonia borane dehydrogenation,” Williams said, adding that the USC Stevens Institute is in the process of patenting the system.
The system is sufficiently lightweight and efficient to have potential fuel applications ranging from motor-driven cycles to small aircraft, he said.
###
The research was funded by the Hydrocarbon Research Foundation and the National Science Foundation.

Do you remember when Jacinda promised no more taxes at the 2017 election? Now we have additional fuel taxes, tourist levies and an extended Bright Line test, just to mention a few.



Well, it is not over yet.



The Government is signalling its intention to slash the price of imported electric and hybrid vehicles by up to $8000 in a bid to make greener cars cheaper for Kiwis.  
But it is also planning to slap a new fee of up to $3000 on the import of vehicles with the highest greenhouse gas emissions.  
The Government has today opened a six-week consultation period before it introduces new legislation in Parliament later this year.  
The plan, according to Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter, will get more Kiwis into cleaner vehicles by reducing some of the cost burden. 



So they are proposing discounts for people who buy EVs or hybrids, even though those people are generally better off and more likely to be able to afford the full price. This is just more middle class welfare as far as I can see.



But wait! There’s more… 



For example, a new Hyundai Ioniq – which has an approximate retail value of just under $60,000 – would cost $52,000 after the full $8000 discount. 



A used Mazda Axela, which is one of New Zealand’s most popular imported vehicles, would cost $7200 after an $800 discount.  
 **But a new Land Rover Sports V8 would be slapped with a $3000 high-emissions fee.**  
A $22,000 Toyota Hiace would cost an extra $1400 after the fee was applied. 



Another slap in the face for rural New Zealand… not to mention tradespeople, and anyone who has to travel any distance (such as salespeople) or tow anything… ever.



Genter said the policy would be cost neutral – meaning the money gained through the fees from higher emitting vehicles would offset the subsidies provided to the lower emission cars.



That is her sop to people who complain about giving discounts to the wealthy, but it is still unacceptable. If you can afford an EV, at a cost of about $70,000, then you can damn well pay for it yourself. I don’t see why I should subsidise it.



“This means people will still have choice, while contributing to the task of cleaning up the vehicles coming into New Zealand.” 



  
Under a government that promised no new taxes (read my lips), this is yet another tax. They may be denying it, but that is what it is. A tax on non-electric vehicles.



We won’t mention at this point that electric vehicles have a bigger carbon footprint than a petrol or diesel vehicle at the manufacturing stage, because they are climate Nazis and there is no point. No one in this government, particularly in the Greens, is going to want to hear anything like that, even if it is true.



I really do think, however, that this could be the undoing of this government. 



New Zealand cities are small by world standards, and even most city dwellers like to get out and about at the weekends – go to the beach, go bush walking, go skiing, take the boat out. This means that almost all recreational activities are going to be subject, sooner or later, to this environmental tax.



Large numbers of New Zealanders live outside the cities, in small towns or rural areas, and for them, EVs are useless. 



What if you are a tradesperson who needs a van to use for work? What if you do a round trip of 40 kms each day to work? What if you are a farmer? A digger driver? A construction worker? A cleaner who needs to go to numerous locations? A building inspector?



What if you live in Manurewa, work in Newmarket at a cleaning job that pays $18 per hour? How are you going to fund an EV?



In other words, if you are a soy latte drinking city dwelling office worker, you’ll be sweet. Everyone else – also known as the backbone of New Zealand – is going to be penalised for needing to use a work vehicle. 



This government seems to be hellbent on destroying all of our primary and secondary industries… and they wonder why business confidence is through the floor?



This could be this government’s ‘shower head and lightbulb’ moment. Imposing further taxes on vehicles that people need to use for work, while giving discounts to those who never will is economic lunacy. 



Please, please, please pass this into law, Julie-Ann Genter. It won’t apply until 2021. At the next election, both National and ACT can campaign on getting rid of this tax and the government will be exposed for the economic jihadists that they really are. The voters can then tell them what they think at the ballot box.

While the GAO issues a report today saying that the US Historical Climatological Monitoring Network has real tangible problems (as I have been saying for years) the Inspector General just released a report this week saying that EPA rushed their CO2 endangerment finding, skipping annoying steps like doing proper review. The lone man holding up his hand at the EPA saying “wait a minute” was Alan Carlin, who was excoriated for doing so.
From Powerline Blog:
Here’s a refresher: in 2009, when the EPA announced its “endangerment” finding to justify its planned regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, Alan Carlin, a 35-year veteran EPA employee who ran the EPA’s National Center for Environmental Economics, produced a 98-page critique of the climate science the EPA used in its finding.  Carlin’s report concluded, “We believe our concerns and reservations are sufficiently important to warrant a serious review of the science by the EPA.”
You can guess what happened next.  The Obama Administration, the one supposedly dedicated to transparency and “restoring science” in public policy making, squashed Carlin’s report and told him to cease and desist any further analysis on climate change issues.  Carlin’s supervisor (a political appointee) emailed his: “I don’t want you to spend any additional EPA time on climate change.  No papers, no research, etc.”  Shortly after this episode Carlin left EPA.  (By the way, Carlin was the chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club in California at one time, and helped with the Sierra Club’s campaign to stop two dam projects back in the 1960s.  In other words, he’s no right-wing ideologue, as the smears of the climate campaigners would have you think.)
This story is relevant again this week not simply for the obvious hypocrisy and double standard (insert the old joke about liberals and double-standards here), but because the issue of the EPA’s climate science has resurfaced in the form of an EPA inspector general’s report that essentially says that Carlin was right about the EPA’s shoddy scientific review.  Here’s the New York Times account from Wednesday:
In a report with wide-reaching political implications, U.S. EPA’s inspector general has found that the scientific assessment backing U.S. EPA’s finding that greenhouse gases are dangerous did not go through sufficient peer review for a document of its importance. . .
According to the IG report, EPA failed to follow the Office of Management and Budget’s peer review procedures for a “highly influential scientific assessment,” which is defined as an assessment that could have an impact of more than $500 million in one year and is “novel, controversial, or precedent setting.”
In particular, the document was reviewed by a 12-member panel that included an EPA employee, violating rules on neutrality. EPA also did not make the review results public, as required, or certify whether it complied with internal or OMB requirements.
In a statement, IG Arthur Elkins Jr. emphasized that his office “did not test the validity of the scientific or technical information used to support the endangerment finding.”
“While it may be debatable what impact, if any, this had on EPA’s finding, it is clear that EPA did not follow all required steps for a highly influential scientific assessment,” he said.
Roger Pielke Jr. observes how the climate campaigners are all circling the wagons, saying “move along, nothing to see here,” and noting that “I’d speculate that these observers would have had different reactions had this report been requested by Henry Waxman in 2006 about the last administration’s EPA. . .   during the Bush Administration concern about processes to ensure scientific integrity were all the rage. At that time it was generally understood that process matters, not simply because it helps to improve the quality of scientific assessments, but also because it helps to establish their legitimacy in the political process.  One sneers at process at some risk.”

=============================================================
I’m proud to say that Alan used materials from WUWT in his report, and that he has been vindicated for standing up to the sloppy rush job.
Thank you Mr. Carlin, for having integrity where others did not.
UPDATE: Climatologist Pat Michaels sums up the whole affair pretty well at Forbes: The EPA’s Endangerment Finding Is Very Endangered

When any discussion sinks to the level of attacking the person rather than the topic or issue at hand, it is a sign that the attacker has lost. When their position is so weak that debating the facts cannot convince their opponent, an _ad hominem_ attack is a resort of the feeble.



 _ **Ad hominem**_ (Latin for “to the person”), short for _argumentum ad hominem_ , typically refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. 



Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized among informal fallacies, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of **fallacies of irrelevance**.



  
Thus, all you right-wing authoritarian, socially dominant, sexist, racist ‘climate deniers’ are the problem!



Asserting dominance over nature is a driving factor among **climate denying conservatives** , a new study has found.



Has anyone ever met a conservative who denies the climate?



Researchers from Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Canberra in Australia identified two “types” of conservative people who **place less importance on climate change and the environment** – socially dominant and right-wing authoritarians.



Two totally different topics are lumped together here. Care for the environment, fresh water, clean air, supporting Kiwi breeding programmes, looking after Blue Penguins or whatever is the “environment” and most ‘conservative’ people are well into these issues and concerns.



‘Climate change’, however you define it, is a whole different ball of wax.



Surveying 22,966 people over five years, they found both types had “lower willingness to make sacrifices for the environment over time”, but the socially dominant types were stronger climate change deniers.



If authoritarian right-wingers were not willing to buy an EV and pay more money as a ‘sacrifice’ to climate change, were they immediately categorised as unwilling to care for the environment?



Socially dominant types were defined as those who want a structured hierarchy in society, while right-wing authoritarians were those with a preference to conform to authority figures and punish those who oppose.



So what did they think about climate change? Put simply, they weren’t fans of making changes.



Despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and its likely impacts, social dominants often viewed the whole issue as something that would never affect them – they thought they were “immune” to it.



They thought that issues such as rising sea levels, that are already threatening various Pacific Island nations, weren’t likely to directly affect them, so they weren’t too worried about it.



Considering that Pacific Island atolls are growing in size, not shrinking, and average sea level rise, as measured by the [76 global tide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567) gauges with records over 100 years and no data quality issues, is currently 0.337mm/year – not being ‘too worried about it’ seems quite reasonable. 



[…] This endorsement and acceptance of social inequality connected to behaviours such as sexism and racism, the study said. 



That sentence makes as much sense as the study the journalist is reporting on!



Social dominants were also found to be accepting of environmental degradation, if it benefited high-status social groups.



Because they wanted power over lower groups, be it other people or nature as a whole, this group was difficult to reach in terms of environmental education. The authors of the study said it would be important to stress that the social hierarchy isn’t threatened by environmental action, in order to reach this group.



Authoritarian types were also considered to be difficult to reach, as they tended to view the conversation surrounding climate change and the environment as “overstated”.



“[Right-wing authoritarian] was related to statements that conceptualise environmental issues as overstated, environmental action as detrimental to the country, and environmentalists as deserving of punishment.”



Researchers explained those who endorse this conservative view were “less likely to assume responsibility for acting on global warming, or intention to mitigate the problem”. […]



  
 **Perhaps they merely switched their brains on and thought for themselves?** Perhaps the socially dominant, right-wing authoritarian conservatives can see through the man-made global warming, climate change, climate catastrophe, climate emergency, tax and control scam? 



Interestingly, no journalist was prepared to own up to writing this nonsense.

"**The rate that coronavirus is being transmitted in the community has been watched keenly by health officials.**
It remained steady for weeks but then fell dramatically, compared to what it was at its peak during lockdown, before starting to go up again.
As of 20 November, the so-called R number was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 in Wales and advisory body Sage was confident it was below 1. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said it could be as high as 1.4, at a briefing a week later.
It was two or three times that earlier in the pandemic.
The R rate is the average number a sick person could pass the virus on to.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething, said the rate needs to drop below 1 for case numbers to begin falling.
""The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level to date have helped to keep the spread of the virus under check,"" he said.
""But there is growing concern these will not be enough to help us through the winter because the virus is spreading so quickly.
""We could see coronavirus infections reach the same level as the spring peak in just a couple of weeks.""
It tells us how many people are likely to get infected from a person who is ill with coronavirus.
So if the R number is R2 - it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. This is how coronavirus spreads.
The lower the number the better - and under one is the aim. As restrictions are lifted, it leads to the R number rising.
So if R is 1 then on average 10 people infected with Covid-19 would pass it on to another 10 people.
But if R is 0.8 then on average 10 people who have caught coronavirus would pass it on to eight others, and so on.
When tThe Welsh Government's scientific advisory group published its data a week after the end of the 17-day firebreak lockdown on 13 November, it estimated a figure between 0.9 and 1.2, down from 1 and 1.3.
As of 20 November, the so-called R number was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1 in Wales and UK advisory body Sage was confident it was below 1.
But First Minister Mark Drakeford said it could be as high as 1.4 when he gave his briefing on 27 November.
Scientists say the R number is useful when coronavirus cases are going up or down but with a low numbers of cases - as over the summer - it was hard to get a good handle on what was happening.
So the lower the number of positive cases, the less useful it is.
But now with cases rising, the R-number and growth rate are seen as more reliable tools again.
This is also why it is also unreliable to try to estimate a R-number for different regions of Wales.
The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) said a low number of cases also means the R number ""becomes very sensitive to daily changes"" in cases found through tracing, causing it to fluctuate weekly.
The R-number plays into a number of ""circuit-breaker"" tests, which health officials and scientists are looking at.
The **growth rate**. This is falling and the Sage scientific group estimates a growth rate of between -0.04 and 0.00 in Wales, indicating that infections could be stable or falling by between 0& and -4% and 0% per day.
Meanwhile, it has been estimated that 16,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 21 November.
Analysis of thousands of **swab results** in a survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) means it can estimate that about one in 185 people in Wales had the virus.
The R number in Wales is worked out by looking at eight different data sources - and it is then a weighted average of estimates.
This includes data from hospitalisations, confirmed cases, deaths and data from contact surveys, which includes a Welsh sample.
The Tac group says the **case rate figures** give an early indication that numbers of confirmed Covid cases per day are reducing.
""This reduction in case numbers is encouraging, but should be treated with caution as this could a result of many factors, including different testing patterns and behaviours due to current restrictions,"" it said.
It said positivity rates had fallen but remain high across Wales, and **hospital occupancy** was similar to the April peak.
In September, a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" was published, after what could happen over the winter and into next spring was modelled by experts at Swansea University.
The worst case looked at 636,000 infections, leading to 18,200 hospital admissions - peaking in January - and potentially 6,300 deaths.
Earlier in the pandemic, the scientific advisers suggested an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if the R number reached 1.1.
Initial estimates earlier in May suggested R 0.8 would lead to 800 more deaths and 7,200 if the rate hit 1.1.
Tac said in its recent report that a consistent R number below 1 would lead to a reduction in cases and hospitalisations, while a consistent R number above 1 would lead to a rise.
But they warn that a small increase in R above 1, maintained for three months, could have a ""huge impact"" on hospital demand and ""greatly increase"" the number of hospital admissions and deaths.
**What else are the experts saying?**
The Sage group of UK scientific advisers is also looking at the speed and how quickly infections are changing each day.
Analysis of data and surveys showing other trends suggested those who reported using a face covering increased further to 82%, whilst those in Wales who said they made essential trips only rose from 38% to 51% - the highest it has been since early July.
Mobility data for Wales also shows how lockdowns have changed behaviour \- where we travel to, including trips to work and shops.
Tac reported that all the data showed ""very large falls after the firebreak started - with mobility back to levels last seen in May in some cases"".
But since the firebreak ended mobility has returned to levels seen before the two-week lockdown.
Tac has also been looking at potential pitfalls from bringing in local lockdowns, with a ""lack of motivation"" likely without furlough support."

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



Traditionally _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress. In this case we are building off of a summary of that literature published about satellite‐​sensed temperatures, the only truly global record that there is, and the only one that cannot suffer from the problem of urban (warming) bias.



Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





It has been 33 years now that satellites have carried Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) capable of measuring the temperature of the lower levels of the atmosphere. These instruments take advantage of the fact that the vibration of the diatomic bond in common oxygen (O2) is proportional to temperature.



The pioneering work of taking the raw MSU observations and developing a temperature record that could be used in climate studies was first done by Roy Spencer and John Christy, then of NASA and University of Alabama‐​Huntsville, whose joint paper in Science magazine back in 1990 introduced the world to this novel atmospheric temperature dataset. Spencer and Christy have continued to extend and improve this important work ever since.



One of the great characteristics of the satellite MSU measurements is that they do not suffer from many of the ills that thermometric measurements taken from the earth’s surface often do. Since the satellite observations are from a bulk layer of the atmosphere, they are not influenced by near‐​surface properties that confound the measurements of surface‐​based thermometers, including such issues as local landscape changes (such as urbanization and deforestation) and uneven spatial coverage.



However, there are also some problems that satellite measurements share with surface measurements, including changing instruments as the MSU sensor has a limited lifetime, so there have been many different ones taking measurements over the years.



There is also the problem changing instrument locations. The satellites orbit at an altitude in which there are still traces of the atmosphere, which drag on the satellites resulting in lower altitudes.



As with surface measurements, these issues must be carefully worked through in order to produce a climatologically useful temperature history. After all, much like the network of surface thermometers, the initial MSU instruments were developed to provide temperature measurements to improve daily weather forecasts, rather than as long‐​term climate monitors.



The painstaking work of Spencer and Christy (and other scientists subsequent to their initial publication), has made the MSU temperature record one the most important tools we have in the study of how the earth’s climate has been changing in recent decades and how the observed changes compare with climate model projections.



The images below show the character of the temporal (Figure 1) and spatial (Figure 2) temperature trends from the earth’s lower atmosphere as compiled by Spencer and Christy from December 1978 through November 2011 — a period spanning 33 years, or nearly a third of a century.







Some general observations:



• The linear trend through the 33‐​yr global record of temperatures in the earth’s lower atmosphere (Figure 1) is 0.138°C/decade.



• The warming trend increases from south to north. The trend in the Southern Hemisphere is 0.078°C/decade. The trend in the Northern Hemisphere is 0.197°C/decade. Substantial portions of the high southern latitudes show little warming or actual cooling.



• The high northern latitudes are warming the at the greatest rate.



• The global rate of warming is near the low end of the climate model projected rate of warming over the last 33 years.



• The rate of warming in the tropical latitudes has been much less than climate model projections of that warming rate.



Take some time to study and consider both Figure 1 and Figure 2 above, for they are the best records of how the earth’s temperatures have changed during the period of the most rapid increase in the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Bear in mind that not all of what you see is a direct response to those emissions. For instance, volcanic eruptions and the oscillations of El Niño/​La Niña have a noticeable and marked impact. But the general picture gives you a pretty good idea of the character of the earth’s temperature change — a character that more than likely will be continued into at least the near future (the next several decades) and likely throughout much of the coming century.

Sometimes you just have to wonder! Let’s freeze the Arctic to make up for all the ice those nasty farmers in New Zealand have melted with their farting cows.



A team of designers led by Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha proposes re-freezing sea water in the Arctic to create miniature modular icebergs using a submarine-like vessel, in a bid to combat climate change.  
The Indonesian designer worked on the prototype with collaborators Denny Lesmana Budi and Fiera Alifa for an international competition organised by the Association of Siamese **Architects**. […]



“The main goal of this idea is to restore the polar ecosystem, which has a direct effect on the balance of the global climate,” said the designer, adding that in this scenario “it is better to prevent than cure“. […]



The submarine-like vessel would submerge to collect sea water in a central hexagonal tank. **Turbines** would then be used to blast the tank with cold air and accelerate the freezing process.



During this process, the vessel would return to the surface of the sea and the tank would be covered to protect it from sunlight. A system of reverse osmosis would be used to filter some of the salt from the water in order to speed up the process.



Once the water is frozen, the vessel would submerge again, leaving behind an “ice baby” with a volume of 2,027 cubic-metres. These miniature icebergs would then cluster together in a honeycomb pattern to form a larger ice floe.



Ever felt the heat rising from the rear of your refrigerator? To freeze something, even cold arctic water, takes energy. The word “turbines” is used. These will run on “fossil” fuels no doubt. They will generate heat as well. 



Everything in this stupid idea, refrigeration, reverse osmosis, pumping heat, takes a lot of work. The latent heat of fusion extracted from the water to turn it into ice and the waste heat from all the processes above will have to go somewhere. If they release the waste heat into the Arctic ocean, or the air, it will most likely melt the ice their submarine just finished freezing.



Muppets!



Watch it all and be amazed.

If I was throwing a dinner party and had to choose between inviting a hardcore Amway enthusiast and a vegan, well, just sign me up for a fun evening learning how to earn extra income.



Amway are notorious for the cult-like evangelism of their members, whose persistence would shame a toddler dragging on your arm in the supermarket aisle and screaming for a Bertie Beetle. **Vegans are even worse.** Vegans seem to see everything as an opening to hold forth on the moral superiority of their cult. Their latest fixation is climate change, and the wholly fictitious notion that veganism is an absolute necessity if we are to avoid barbecuing the entire planet.



After years of failed global attempts to cut carbon emissions meaningfully, some activists are propagating the idea that everyone on the planet should go vegetarian or even vegan.



But when an idea is too ridiculous for even the Greens, then you just know it’s all a load of pure-meat baloney.



It’s interesting to note that even environmentalists themselves are loathe to make the major lifestyle changes that would be required to avoid all meat products. A recent survey found that most of the UK Green Party’s elected representatives are in fact meat-eaters…who see veganism is a fad.



Still, this nonsense gets a lot of uncritical airtime, mainly, it seems, because it panders to the never-ending thirst for climate change extremism among the media-elite.



The truth is we can’t stop temperature rises with our diets…First, that cut isn’t to our entire emissions — just those from food. That means Four-fifths of emissions are ignored, according to an analysis of emission from the European Union, which means the impact is actually five-times lower.



Second, the more optimistic figures about how much of your emissions you can cut are based not just on a vegetarian diet, but on an entirely vegan one where we avoid every single animal product altogether.



But, the luvvies know that veganism is **way** harder to sell to the masses than vegetarianism. Especially to the masses in developing countries who are itching to get **off** a vegetarian diet imposed by poverty, and chow down on some of that luxurious, tasty meat.



A systematic peer-review of studies of going vegetarian shows that a non-meat diet will likely reduce an individual’s emissions by…just 4.3%.



This still overstates the effect, because it ignores the well-established “rebound effect.” Vegetarian diets are slightly cheaper, and saved money will likely be spent on other goods and services that cause extra greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., vegetarians save at least $750 on their food budgets every year. That extra spending will cause more carbon dioxide emissions, cancelling about half the saved carbon emissions from going vegetarian.



So much for the much-vaunted savings from going vegetarian. $750 a year is a price I’ll gladly pay to keep my steak, instead of some tasteless, vat-grown conglomeration of industrial chemistry.



In a first world setting, the reality is that going entirely vegetarian for the rest of your life means you reduce your emissions by about 2%, according to a study of the environmental impact of Swedish vegetarians.



  
So you decide, dear readers: reduce emissions by a whole two percent, or, for just $14 a week, continue to enjoy tasty, nutritious meat? In fact, **why not show your utter contempt for environmental hysteria by ordering a[delicious Whale Meat Company package](https://whalemeat.co.nz/) today?**

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s nice to see that academia in Austria is getting more and more tolerant with every passing day. In fact we haven’t seen this level of tolerance in about 70 years.

University of Graz Professor Richard Parncutt. Photo source: Uni-Graz./
There’s been much buzz in the blogs recently about the seemingly psychotic music professor calling for the death penalty for skeptics of IPCC science. He claims that by being skeptical of climate science, we are hindering necessary policy measures that will supposedly prevent the deaths of hundreds of millions of future people. A figure the loony prof calls “conservative”.
Parncutt also wants to have the Pope executed

Reader Quinn over at WUWT now brings our attention to a report on how Prof Richard Parncutt has also called for the execution of the head of the Catholic Church, Pope Benedict. WND Faith website here writes:
‘The pope and perhaps some of his closest advisers should be sentenced to  death,’ wrote Richard Parncutt, a music teacher at the University of Graz,  Austria.
Parncutt must have an affinity for recommending the death penalty, as WND reported only a day earlier that  Parncutt was labeled the ‘Green Weenie of the Year’ for also recommending in a blog post that those who don’t believe in global warming should be executed.
Now, according to a report from CampusReform.org,  Parncutt also has put the pope down on his list of those to be eliminated.
The report said Parncutt wrote, ‘I am talking about the current pope, because his continuing refusal to make a significant change to the church’s position on  contraception will certainly result in millions of further unnecessary deaths  from AIDS in the future.'”

The recent heat wave in the Midwest and the eastern United States has been characterized by all sorts of exaggerated claims. One even made it into Wikipedia as an “official” all time high record. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_temperature_extremes

Dr. Roy Spencer alerted me to a problem on Monday, and I did some preliminary investigation, confirming that yes indeed, not only was that 113°F value not an official new high temperature record, it doesn’t even appear to be air temperature, but so far out of line could it be the heat index value for July 22nd? Either that, or a careless typo by the volunteer Wikipedian conflating 103F to 113F.
I wanted to wait a few days to see if Wikipedia’s claim that it is “self-correcting” would actually work as advertised, and I’m happy to report that the table has in fact been corrected.

It is back to the previous value of 106°F / 41°C July 15, 1995 in Danbury, CT, which is well documented. But doing further research on the high for July 22nd that was erroneously cited, even that value seems to be inconsistent with published records.
So what was the actual record and the previous one for Hartford? Well, that’s the thing, depending on where you look, you get different answers. Curious, I found myself getting sucked down another climate science rabbit hole, which took my entire Saturday morning and part of Saturday afternoon to compile for you below. 
First, I checked the record event report (RER) for Windsor locks (Now an ASOS station at Hartford’s Bradley International Airport) from the NWS WSFO in Boston:
000

SXUS71 KBOX 222019

RERBDL

RECORD EVENT REPORT

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TAUNTON MA

419 PM EDT FRI JUL 22 2011

...RECORD DAILY MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE AND AN ALL TIME RECORD

TEMPERATURE SET AT HARTFORD CT...

AT 406 PM THE TEMPERATURE REACHED

103 DEGREES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

THIS SETS A NEW RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR TODAYS DATE FOR

HARTFORD CT. THE PREVIOUS RECORD WAS 101 DEGREES IN

1926.THE TEMPERATURE OF 103 DEGREES ALSO SETS AN ALL TIME

RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR HARTFORD.

THE PREVIOUS RECORD OF 102 DEGREES WAS SET ON MULTIPLE DATES OF

JULY 6 2010...AUGUST 9 OF 2001 AND JULY 3 OF 1996.
And that was dutifully reported in the Norwich Bulletin, which erroneously conflated in the title the new Windsor Locks (Bradley Airport) record for the date, and all time high for that station, with the all time high state record of 106°F on July 15th, 1995 in Danbury, CT:

Clearly, it wasn’t the hottest day in the state history. The headline is wrong.
But here’s the thing,  when you go check the official records at the National Climatic Data Center’s interactive records plotting tool, you don’t get the same as what was reported in the RER:

That’s odd.
The RER from WSFO Boston says for the date of July 22nd:
THE PREVIOUS RECORD WAS 101 DEGREES IN 1926.
The NCDC Records lookup says:
Previous 97.0°F on 1955-07-22
Let’s check some other sources, the HamWeather interactive records generator says:

They report yet a third previous record value:
Old record 97° in 1926
Bizarre. Three different sources say the previous record was three different values and dates in the past.
So what was the previous high temperature record for Hartford Bradley Airport/Windsor Locks? I have no idea, and apparently nobody is sure either, including NWS/NOAA/NCDC.
But I started to wonder about the station itself. This was an ASOS station, and as we know, they tend to have technical problems associated with reporting false high temperatures due to a design flaw, and sometimes due to placement. So I decided to have a look at the station itself. First stop, NCDC MMS station meta-database to get the exact lat/lon for the ASOS station with the COOP ID NUMBER of 063456 as reported by NCDC.
Oddly though, when I went to look up the lat/lon, I found this station had two COOP NUMBERs assigned to it, 063456 and 069704:

Looking at the history, that appears related to a station move in 1954:

By NOAA COOP station rules (as I understand them), new COOP numbers are assigned when the new environment is appreciably different, such as by distance, elevation, and/or environment. This may explain why we have different references to past record high temperature. The databases presenting the record comparisons may be using different COOP ID numbers.
But what about the temperature record of 103°F itself? I wanted to see how it compared to nearby stations, because as I’ve demonstrated in the past, ASOS stations can produce false high temperature records where a nearby station might be degrees cooler. For example the ASOS station in Honolulu that created a whole string of false temperature records that the NWS admits to, but leaves the records intact anyway. In that episode I demonstrated that two NOAA stations, only 3.9 miles apart had vastly different high temperatures. One station (ASOS at the airport) set records, the other, at the NOAA Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not.
So how would this one in Hartford hold up? Well at first glance, we see the Google Earth image for the Hartford Bradley ASOS station at 41.9381 -72.6825 shows a significantly different environment than the surrounding countryside:

The “A” marks the location of the ASOS weather station. Note how the airport is a patch of brown in a sea of green, likely due to the change in vegetation. That’s quite a stark contrast and certainly does not seem representative of the area.
In the National Weather Service Observing Handbook No. 2 (NWS, 1989), it talks about “representivity” stating:
“The equipment site should be fairly level, sodded, and free from obstructions (exhibit 5.1). It should be typical of the principal natural agricultural soils and conditions of the area…Neither the pan nor instrument shelter should be placed over heat-absorbing surfaces such as asphalt, crushed rock, concrete slabs or pedestals. The equipment should be in full sunlight during as much of the daylight hours as possible, and be generally free of obstructions to wind flow.”
Here’s the closeup view of the ASOS station at Bradley AP:

While certainly fine placement for monitoring the runways, it is not the best for climate monitoring. Note the mower lines. The character of the grass changes with the season no doubt.
So I decided to have a look at the data that day, Weather Underground helpfully archives the data, and they report the record high:

I found the temperature graph WU plotted very interesting:

It appears that from 1:30PM to 5PM, the temperature plateaued and did not change. To me, that suggests some sort of saturation related equipment failure. But, since I don’t have maintenance records for that station, I can only speculate.
But, there are other sources of data. Weather Underground also helpfully logs private weather stations in the area. Here’s one located on Poquonock / Hawthorne Ln, Windsor, CT at lat/lon 41.885 -72.692, just 3.6 miles to the SSW:

And the high temperature WU reported by that station KCTWINDS6, is 99.9°F, which is 3 degrees cooler than the nearby airport record high of 103°F:

Here’s the temperature graph:

Note the duration of the plateau is shorter, from about 2:15PM to 4:30PM. Note also the time at which the 99.9 F high occurred:
15:53   99.9 °F
3:53PM was Tmax for this private weather station.
Remember the RER from WSFO Boston said:
AT 406 PM THE TEMPERATURE REACHED 103 DEGREES AT BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
So why the 3 degree difference in Tmax at about the same time? One possibility is that the airport environment is more efficient at converting solar radiation to heat, and kept accumulating heat faster than the environment of the KCTWINDS6, or as I posited earlier, it may have something to do with the ASOS equipment itself.
OK, well maybe that’s a fluke, let’s look at another station. I found another one logged by WU about 12 miles SE, called KCTMANCH2.

The high at KCTMANCH2 is also 99.9°F, which is 3 degrees cooler than the nearby airport record high of 103°F:

The graph is consistent with the other private weather station:

As is the time of the high temperature:
15:45  99.9 °F
While the other private station  KCTWINDS6 had no metadata on the station type, I tend to trust the data from this particular station, because it is a quality weather station , one of the best available, The Davis Vantage Pro2 with fan aspiration:

So we have two stations at 6 and 12 miles from the airport that show identical highs (99.9°F) in a similar time frame. But, lest I be accused of cherry picking, lets look at another nearby station, one that does not agree with my premise, one even closer, just under 3 miles away at 41.920 -72.735:

This station, KCTEASTG2 had a high temperature that hit 103.6°F, and in fact it would be rounded up to 104°F by NWS rules if it were an official station. At first glance it would tend to confirm the airport record high temperature as being valid.

But when you look at the data log, you discover an odd discontinuity, the high temperature was set around 11AM:

From the KCTEASTG2 data arhcive, that high was:
11:13   103.6 °F
That Tmax doesn’t make any sense meteorologically. It is before peak insolation, and very short lived. According to this solar calculator provide by NASA, solar noon for that location is at 13:57 (GMT-6, DST enabled).
A check of other days of data, such as on July 20th, July 19th, show a similar odd peak in late morning, well before solar noon.

I’d tend to discount this station data as it looks to me as some sort of local exposure effect, like the station being influenced by direct sun or reflection of sun off a window or some other similar bias which can happen in backyard. Note the data settles down afterwards. This could simply be a case of direct or reflected sun hitting the sensor.
The metadata published by WU on KCTEASTG2  also doesn’t support a good case for this station’s measurement quality:

The WS-2308CH is a cheap weather station made in China, sold by LaCrosse. One of the big design flaws is the thermometer shelter, seen below, which bizarrely has no slots or louvers for air flow in the plastic cover, which would tend to create a trapped air hotspot when exposed to direct sunlight. That makes this station temperature exposure suspect if it gets the direct sun.

Back to the data. After that first peak at around 11AM, it cools rapidly, then starts a slow plateau upwards, peaking again over 90 minutes earlier than the time of the record high set at the airport
14:25  100.9 °F
That’s still two degrees cooler than the airport, and around the time of all the other measurements, a window of 15:45-16:15, we find:

So given the later afternoon temperatures are in the settled period after the first 11AM peak, they might be valid. The temperature data for that period are in agreement with the other two private weather stations I cite above.
Finally one more station, this one 7.4 miles to the NNE at 42.009 -72.576 in a residential area:

The temperature peaked at 102.0F

The timing of Tmax was also a bit earlier than the other stations, but has that similar ramp up right about 11AM:

According the KCTENFIE5 data archive, the Tmax was just before 1 PM:
12:55   102.0 °F
That peak temperature is an hour before solar noon in the area at 13:57, and very brief, 20 minutes later it is down a whole degree again:
13:15   101.0 °F
It never comes close to that peak again at solar noon or thereafter, so again there may be some sort of local exposure effect going on. This station while a good one, is not fan aspirated:

Without looking at the site and equipment placement, I can’t tell if that early Tmax is related to some sort of exposure issue (like a sunlight reflection) or not. But it is suspect giving the time prior to solar noon and briefness of it. Even so it didn’t reach the 103°F recorded at the airport.
At the time of the new record high at the airport, 4:06 PM, 7.3 miles to the SW, the temperature at  is once again in agreement KCTENFIE5 with all the other private weather stations nearby:
16:05    99.0 °F
Summary

The Norwich Bulletin reporter didn’t check the data, and erroneously conflated all time station record with an all time state record.
The previous record dates/values for Windsor locks cited by three different sources doesn’t match the Record Event Report issued by WSFO Boston, possibly due to the station move not being recorded in the databases properly or old databases being used.
There was no new all time state record for Connecticut set. The old one of 106°F on July 15th, 1995 in Danbury, CT stands.
The land use/albedo of the Windsor Locks/Bradley AP ASOS is significantly different than the surrounding area, and by NOAA’s own COOP handbook, would not likely be representative.
Other weather stations around the airport within a radius of 3-12 miles don’t show a Tmax equal to the new record high of 103°F for Windsor Locks/Bradley AP ASOS. The one that does is highly suspect due to timing and equipment. A second station that comes close has a Tmax before solar noon.
All four stations around the airport are within a degree of each other, between 99.0 and 99.9F  around 4PM, when the new record high was recorded.
As demonstrated previously in Honolulu, ASOS airport stations are known to create new record highs erroneously. This was also demonstrated by an episode of record high temperatures in Tuczon related to ASOS equipment documented by professor Ben Herman.
Now, as documented on WUWT a few days ago, even internal NOAA staff are beginning to doubt the accuracy of these ASOS stations.

So what is my point of all this and why did I spend so much time on it?
It is easy to claim new records, and to report them. Just look at how easy it was for some dimwit to turn 103°F  into 113°F on Wikipedia and how easy it was for the reporter to make a false claim of confusion about the all time Connecticut state record. It took just a few minutes for the reporter to write the story and headline claiming “hottest day in state history”, but it took half a day of solid work to debunk it and present it here.
When one goes looking at the data in context, a different story emerges. That story shows that there’s far more to the temperature data than the peaks and valleys. Often, they don’t make sense in the context of the measurement environment, yet they are widely used, often without question as demonstrated in this episode. Worse, sloppy or confused old records don’t seem to be adequate for determining what the previous record high for the date actually is, as demonstrated by the wide disagreement in reporting it.
To fully understand what we are measuring in surface temperature, taking the single peak high temperature without understanding the context of it can be a risky business. As I’ve said many times before, the dynamically changing land use environment at airports is inconsistent with the need for stability in long term climate measurement. Even if the station never moved, comparing highs of the past (when the airport was smaller) can lead to inflated highs today.
I would hope that NOAA takes a hard look at the new record high at Windsor Locks/Bradley AP, to see if it is valid, and that the Norwich Bulletin corrects their erroneous story about the state all-time high.

"It is amazing for me to see the very aggressive building boom underway in south Florida; on the beaches and barrier islands, throughout downtown and in the low western areas bordering the Everglades. They are building like there is no tomorrow. Unfortunately, they are right. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) published its assessment of sea level rise in 2012 as part of the National Climate Assessment. Including estimates based on limited and maximum melt of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, it anticipated a raise of 4.1 to 6.6ft (1.25 to 2m) by 2100, reaching 2ft (0.6m) by around 2050 and 3ft (0.9m) by around 2075. This degree of sea level rise would make nearly all the barrier islands of the world uninhabitable, inundate a major portion of the world’s deltas, upon which hundreds of millions of people live, and leave low-lying coastal zones like southeast Florida increasingly difficult to maintain infrastructure services for and increasingly vulnerable to hurricanes and storms.  Most models of projected sea level rise assume a gradual acceleration of sea level in line with gradually accelerating ice melt. But our knowledge of how sea level rose in the past paints a very different picture of response to climate change.  At the peak of the last ice age 18,000 years ago sea level was some 420ft (128m) lower due to the vast quantities of water locked away in continental ice sheets. Subsequent ice melt was not a gradual process, but rather a series of very rapid pulses of sea level rise interspersed with pauses in which coastal environments formed. During pulses the seas rose between 3-30ft (0.9-9m) fast enough to drown not just reefs, sandy barrier islands, tidal inlets and other coastal features, stranding their remnants across the continental shelf, now disappeared beneath the ocean.  That is what happens when climate change warms enough to destabilise some ice sheet sector.  It rapidly disintegrates, resulting in a rapid rise. This is what is beginning to happen to the Greenland ice sheet, where surface melting has concentrated dust and black carbon in the ice on the melting surface darkening and further accelerating the surface melt. More importantly, warmed ocean water has accelerated the ice melt at both poles, working its way into the glacial fjords under the ice sheet in Greenland and under the outlet glaciers around the Antarctic ice sheets. While this “warm” water is only 2-4°C, even this moderate heat is capable of vast amounts of ice melt, and once started, the melt creates positive reinforcing feedbacks that speed the acceleration far beyond anything originally anticipated.  Water on the melting ice surface adsorbs more heat which accelerates the surface melt. Meltwater percolating down through the ice lubricates the base permitting faster motion, which results in more extensive fracturing, in turn allowing more, warmer water through the fractures and into the interior of the ice sheet, and so on. We are most certainly witnessing the onset of a rapid pulse of sea level rise. Flying 50 miles over Greenland’s interior last summer, the Jacobshaven (or Ilulissat) Icefjord looked like the bed of a giant meandering stream carved on the surface of the ice. The bottom of the channel, some 500ft (152m) below the level of the ice sheet above was moving faster than than the ice above, having been penetrated by the warmed ocean water. As a result the ice has dramatically fractured and has accelerated, from moving a couple of miles in a year to over 20. A spectacular but most disturbing experience. Even if we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, the greenhouse gasses already in the atmosphere will continue to warm the atmosphere for at least another 30 years. And as most of this heat has already been absorbed by the oceans, which have the capacity to store heat for centuries, the overall effect on ice sheet melt will continue for centuries, accelerating all the way. If we are at just 5ft (1.5m) rise at the end of the century, sea level will be rising at a foot per decade – think about trying to maintain a port facility anywhere with that. To consider the risk in present investments is beyond sobering. By the middle of this century most of the barrier islands of south Florida and the world will be abandoned and the people relocated, while low areas such as Sweetwater and Hialeah bordering the Everglades will be frequently flooded and increasingly difficult places to live. Florida will start to lose its freshwater resources, its infrastructure will begin to fail, and the risk of catastrophic storm surges and hurricane flooding will increase.  Florida counties should be planning for their future to determine at what point the costs of maintaining functional infrastructure, insurance, and human health and safety becomes economically impossible. Already, there are areas and properties that will become unlivable within a 30-year mortgage cycle. The Four-county Compact on climate change in southeast Florida has some 1,200 action items to help ensure some stability for the communities there.  For south Florida, forget the levees and dikes. That may be fine for New Orleans and the Netherlands, but not here where the limestone and sand under our homes is much too porous and permeable. For each day action is put off, it becomes harder and more expensive to make the inevitable changes required. Without planning, there will come a point where society will collapse into chaos. "

Bad news for Greenware cups like the one below.

Study: Biodegradable Products May Be Bad For The Environment
Research from North Carolina State University shows that so-called biodegradable products are likely doing more harm than good in landfills, because they are releasing a powerful greenhouse gas as they break down.
“Biodegradable materials, such as disposable cups and utensils, are broken down in landfills by microorganisms that then produce methane,” says Dr. Morton Barlaz, co-author of a paper describing the research and professor and head of NC State’s Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering. “Methane can be a valuable energy source when captured, but is a potent greenhouse gas when released into the atmosphere.”

And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that only about 35 percent of municipal solid waste goes to landfills that capture methane for energy use. EPA estimates that another 34 percent of landfills capture methane and burn it off on-site, while 31 percent allow the methane to escape.
“In other words,” Barlaz says, “biodegradable products are not necessarily more environmentally friendly when disposed in landfills.”
This problem may be exacerbated by the rate at which these man-made biodegradable materials break down. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines call for products marked as “biodegradable” to decompose within “a reasonably short period of time” after disposal. But such rapid degradation may actually be environmentally harmful, because federal regulations do not require landfills that collect methane to install gas collection systems for at least two years after the waste is buried. If materials break down and release methane quickly, much of that methane will likely be emitted before the collection technology is installed. This means less potential fuel for energy use, and more greenhouse gas emissions.
As a result, the researchers find that a slower rate of biodegradation is actually more environmentally friendly, because the bulk of the methane production will occur after the methane collection system is in place. Some specific biodegradable products such as bags that hold yard waste and are always sent to composting or anaerobic digestion facilities were not included in the study.
“If we want to maximize the environmental benefit of biodegradable products in landfills,” Barlaz says, “we need to both expand methane collection at landfills and design these products to degrade more slowly – in contrast to FTC guidance.”
The paper, “Is Biodegradability a Desirable Attribute for Discarded Solid Waste? Perspectives from a National Landfill Greenhouse Gas Inventory Model,” was co-authored by Barlaz and NC State Ph.D. student James Levis, and was published online May 27 by the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The research was supported by Procter & Gamble and the Environmental Research and Education Foundation.

“Is Biodegradability a Desirable Attribute for Discarded Solid Waste? Perspectives from a National Landfill Greenhouse Gas Inventory Model”
Authors: James W. Levis, Morton A. Barlaz, North Carolina State University
Published: Online May 27, Environmental Science & Technology
Abstract: There is increasing interest in the use of biodegradable materials because they are believed to be “greener”. In a landfill, these materials degrade anaerobically to form methane and carbon dioxide. The fraction of the methane that is collected can be utilized as an energy source and the fraction of the biogenic carbon that does not decompose is stored in the landfill. A landfill life-cycle model was developed to represent the behavior of MSW components and new materials disposed in a landfill representative of the U.S. average with respect to gas collection and utilization over a range of environmental conditions (i.e., arid, moderate wet, and bioreactor). The behavior of materials that biodegrade at relatively fast (food waste), medium (biodegradable polymer) and slow (newsprint and office paper) rates was studied. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHBO) was selected as illustrative for an emerging biodegradable polymer. Global warming potentials (GWP) of 26, 720, -1000, 990, and 1300 kg CO2e wet Mg1_ were estimated for MSW, food waste, newsprint, office paper, and PHBO, respectively in a national average landfill. In a state-of-the-art landfill with gas collection and electricity generation, GWP’s of -250, 330, -1400, -96, and -420 kg CO2e wet Mg1 _ were estimated for MSW, food waste, newsprint, office paper and PHBO, respectively. Additional simulations showed that for a hypothetical material, a slower biodegradation rate and a lower extent of biodegradation improve the environmental performance of a material in a landfill representative of national average conditions.

Would you spend a lot of your own money on something that would give you and your family very little, if any, benefit? Probably not. Yet this is precisely what the government leaders now meeting in Copenhagen are demanding from their taxpayers.



With the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol set to expire in 2012, proponents view the meeting in Copenhagen this month as critical to extending and expanding efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.



But even if implemented successfully, the new efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have almost no impact on global warming (cutting predicted future warming by only a fraction of a degree).



And, while it is impossible to predict the cost of any protocol to emerge from Copenhagen right now, there are estimates of costs for the Kyoto Protocol, as well as the Waxman‐​Markey bill passed in June by the U.S. House that would put in place a cap‐​and‐​trade regime aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.



The London‐​based Taxpayers Alliance estimated the cost of complying with Kyoto in Europe to be between $67.8 billion and $170.8 billion through 2008. And what did Europe get for these costs? Emissions rose in many European countries between 1997 and 2006, including some signatories of the Kyoto Protocol. The Energy Information Administration estimated that compliance costs in the U.S. would have been $400 billion a year. Ironically, emissions fell 3 percent in the U.S., which did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, between 2000 and 2006.



The Waxman‐​Markey bill, like the companion Senate legislation and the Kyoto Protocol, aims to limit emissions from fossil fuels. The inevitable result is an increase in energy prices and all that entails for the economy.



A study by the Brookings Institution finds that meeting the Waxman‐​Markey emissions targets would result in a loss of personal consumption from $1 trillion to $2 trillion; GDP would be lower by 2.5 percent by 2050; and there would be 1.7 million fewer jobs. The Heritage Foundation estimates the largest GDP losses – up to $9.4 trillion cumulatively from 2012 to 2035 – and projects 2.5 million fewer jobs.



These independent studies project costs far larger than official estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Congressional Budget Office. But even if one takes the government numbers at face value, the proposals still do not meet basic cost‐​benefit tests, in that the impact of the CO2 emissions control — even if could be achieved — would make only a tiny difference in the Earth’s temperature.



And this is to say nothing of ongoing uncertainties about what is actually going on with the Earth’s climate, which hasn’t warmed in 11 years – a pause that was not predicted by global warming scientists. As leading climatologist Kevin Trenberth wrote in one of the e‐​mails recently leaked from the Climate Research Unit in Britain, “we don’t know why it is not warming.”



So, in other words, the proposals before the U.S. Congress are almost all pain and no gain.



There’s a better way.



Throughout history, mankind has been in a constant state of rebuilding and adapting to climate changes. It’s a proven course of action, and one that doesn’t depend on predictions by climate scientists about what is going to happen in 100 years.



Whether global warming is a real problem or not, adaptation is a far less costly and far more effective way of coping then trying to re‐​engineer the Earth’s climate.

"**Contact tracing is seen as an important part of controlling the spread of Covid-19. Wales' system has consistently managed to reach the majority of cases and their close contacts, despite the pressure of rising numbers. But what's it like to work in this new role?**
Bridget Thomas' job at the North East Wales Archive has long allowed her to indulge her passion for history - but this year she's been playing a part in the historical events of 2020.
The archive is run by Flintshire and Denbighshire councils, and the 59-year-old was internally redeployed in June, splitting her time between her normal job and using her research skills as a tracer for Test, Trace, Protect (TTP).
""I wanted to do something to help. I can't work on a ward in a hospital, but I can do this,"" she said.
Her role, after a period of training, has entailed calling people who have tested positive to ask - and sometimes persuade - them to name the people they have been in contact with.
The positive cases are normally expecting the call - but tracers like Mrs Thomas know nothing about them.
""It can be quite intense. I deal with people of all ages, and people in care home settings, families, people who are very ill, or people who have been recently bereaved by Covid - it could be any scenario,"" she said.
""But people are disarmingly honest and open. Sometimes they'll say 'I know I shouldn't have done that', but I brush over that - it's done and gone.
""They generally don't seem worried for themselves. They worry about other people - infecting their children, or infecting their elderly parents if they care for them.
""We're not clinicians and there is a system in place to escalate [non-emergency medical queries].""
The names the positive cases give them are passed on to TTP ""contact advisers"", who call to tell them to self-isolate for 14 days and keep in touch daily.
Mrs Thomas said some of the people she called were concerned about their jobs and about naming close contacts ""because obviously you're implicating a work colleague for example, and making them isolate at home for 14 days"".
She said local knowledge - for example the location of workplaces, schools and colleges - helped with identifying potential clusters of cases.
When she first started, she noticed patterns of transmission in places like hospitals, care homes and work places.
But ""viruses love parties"" and over the summer more cases were linked to barbecues, birthday gatherings, pubs and tourists returning from holiday.
""As we progressed into autumn, it was then schools and colleges,"" she said. ""The one constant has been healthcare staff - and now [it's winter and] people are staying in, I'm seeing more infection spreading within families. ""
Tracers are looking for people who may be at risk of infection because they have been in contact with a positive case during the 48 hours before they developed symptoms or, if someone is asymptomatic, during the 48 hours before they took the test, up to 10 full days afterwards.
A close contact includes anyone who:
The Covid-19 contact tracing app is supposed to kick in if you've been near a positive case in a shop for example.
Flintshire council is employing all the TTP staff for the counties in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area.
Senior HR manager Sharon Carney said: ""We need people with good listening skills, who are quite empathetic and politely persistent. We train them to listen to the pauses - is there something the person is not saying?""
They began recruiting externally in August, and new team members include hospitality workers, aircraft cabin crew and a retired police officer.
Many have said they are motivated by wanting to help.
""But we all wish it would go away,"" Mrs Thomas said.
Having dealt so closely with bereaved people this summer, Mrs Thomas reiterated that every Covid death is a tragedy, but her archive experience has also allowed her to put the current pandemic in its historical context.
""It's new to us - but it happened with Spanish flu, the plague, cholera.
""I came across a record from 1839 the other day that was a request from a parish council to the magistrates, asking for funeral wakes to be banned because they were spreading cholera,"" she said.
""We also hold education logbooks for local schools from 1862... usually written by the head teacher [providing] a social record of how prevalent childhood diseases like measles, diphtheria, influenza, and scarlet fever were before mass vaccination.
""Whole classes would regularly be required to stay at home, not only to deep-clean classrooms but also to stop transmission of disease. Unfortunately, school log books also record many deaths of children from disease.
""What our ancestors had to put up with was unbelievable. Covid-19 will be over one day. We just have to get through it.""
As case numbers rose, the overall speed of TTP in Wales slowed down relatively, although it picked up to a degree in November as the ""firebreak"" took effect.
Although the system has generally reached more than 80% of cases and close contacts, in reality the huge rise in transmission since September has meant thousands have not been contacted at all.
Overall since June, TTP in Wales has reached 47,992 positive cases, and 132,323 people ""close contacts"".
Almost 1,800 tracers and contact advisers are in place across Wales and the Welsh Government has put forward more funding to councils to recruit a further 1,300 staff for the winter."
"**""I've been called a pandemic actor. I reply: 'I must be a good one as I let a doctor cut a hole in my throat'.""**
Jamie Branagan, 52, returned to care home nursing when the coronavirus pandemic broke out - but it was a decision that nearly cost him his life.
Mr Branagan spent a month in a coma and suffered a cardiac arrest, kidney failure and collapsed lung, after contracting Covid-19 himself.
He said he will never work again and wants to prevent more people dying.
""I've been trawling the internet looking for Covid deniers, trying to educate them. They are so indoctrinated. They see videos and think they are experts,"" said Mr Branagan, from Newport.
""It's a killer. A very good friend lost their father recently. People need to wake up.""
A leaflet containing coronavirus ""conspiracy theories"" and downplaying the pandemic as a hoax, was posted through Pembrokeshire letterboxes recently, leading Dyfed-Powys Police to issue a warning.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething described it as ""very worrying"", while Labour wants emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online.
Mr Branagan backed calls to bring those spreading misinformation to account, describing how his life as a fit and healthy man who played football until recently was changed forever.
He was born in London and had only ever wanted to work in the care sector, with some of his earliest memories those of driving around with his mother as she worked as a district nurse in Belfast and then Suffolk.
In 1999, Mr Branagan qualified as a mental health nurse, before moving up to a clinical lead role, which brought him to Newport in 2012 overseeing care homes.
This took him away from day-to-day care, and he was able to set up his own ""niche business"", trouble shooting, helping those in crisis to become compliant with rules and regulations.
But when a coronavirus pandemic looked imminent at the start of the year, he made the decision to go back into agency nursing to help out, adding: ""That's when my life changed.
""They (care homes) were like an elephant's graveyard. Vulnerable people who had tested positive were sent to die.""
""I get people want to return home to die in dignity, but to introduce such an infectious virus [to a care home], you are lighting the blue touch paper,"" he said.
""During the first wave, we didn't have the knowledge we have now... it was a tinderbox situation and it was always going to go.""
Mr Branagan said he does not blame authorities who were trying to cope with a situation that was quickly spiralling out of control, but does believe care homes were ""poorly supported"" at the start of the pandemic.
He described the spread of coronavirus as a question of ""when not if"", with vulnerable people - some with dementia - relying on face-to-face interaction, some wandering into other people's rooms and inadequate personal protective equipment.
""What can you do? You're on shift and people rely on you,"" he said.
""There was a lady who was dying, so I bent the rules so she could speak to her family one last time.
""This situation was not unique, but the son was able to say goodbye to his mum. She had no mask on and you're facilitating a FaceTime call.""
It was on 19 April Mr Branagan woke up three hours before a shift with pins and needles down the right side of his body and a headache, prompting him to self-isolate.
His partner Angharad, had also contracted coronavirus, but only experienced mild symptoms.
Mr Branagan, however, was taken to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital, and on 30 April was placed in a coma while in respiratory arrest.
He woke up on 2 June, and spent 34 of 45 days ventilated in intensive care. He suffered a cardiac arrest, contracted two types of pneumonia, had acute kidney failure, sepsis, a collapsed lung and blood clots, and lost five stone.
His memories are based only on what his partner has told him, but said: ""I remember having vivid dreams, not very pleasant ones, they have stuck in my mind constantly.
""I then had to learn to walk, talk and eat again.""
Muscles in his fingers had wasted away to such an extent he could not hold a cup.
But while he needed glasses to drive before contracting coronavirus, Mr Branagan described his sight now being ""crystal clear"", as muscles had relaxed so much his eyes had fallen back into place.
He returned home on 9 June, and described the months since as ""a long struggle"" - coping with cysts on his lungs, suffering from fatigue and breathlessness.
Mr Branagan does not believe he will work again as he operates at 20% of his capacity.
""It's like the uninvited guest at a party. Smashes through your front door, drinks all your beer, wrecks your house, snogs your girlfriend then leaves,"" he said of the virus.
Mr Branagan praised intensive care unit staff that treated him. He called Dr David Hepburn ""an absolute legend"", adding: ""He's the reason I'm here today.""
Dr Hepburn was one of the first doctors to get ill from coronavirus in early March and has been outspoken, highlighting the risks to healthcare workers.
He described intensive care as being ""like a scene from a science fiction film"" and said everyone who has worked in hospitals during the pandemic will be changed.
The Welsh Government said: ""We understand this would have been a stressful and scary time, and a difficult one for this gentleman and his family. We are pleased he has recovered.
""Keeping care home residents and staff safe has always been a priority for the Welsh Government. We have put in place a wide range of support for care homes, including free PPE, additional funding and advice and guidance about infection control.
""Our programme of testing for care homes remains in place and no one can be discharged to a care home without testing negative for Covid-19. We will continue to work with all partners to minimise the risk of Covid-19 in care home residents and staff."""

On the Road Again: Fred Singer will be speaking at the Santa Fe Conference on Tuesday morning immediately following Richard Muller of the BEST project. Singer’s comments will raise some issues concerning the BEST findings.

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
The past two weeks have been marked by several events that are causing considerable controversy in the global warming / climate change community. These events include the report on land surface temperatures from BEST, a book by Donna Laframboise on the IPCC, a paper by William Gray, and a paper claiming no major global climate change over the past 20,000 years followed by a compelling rebuttal.

*******
BEST Report: Richard Muller, the head of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) team, announced in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that BEST has submitted four articles for publication on its findings regarding the land surface temperature record. The article that garnered the greatest interest is the finding that the BEST results are consistent with the records reported by NOAA, Climatic Research Unit (CRU), and NASA-GISS, and that if there is an outlier it is NASA-GISS. BEST reports that the record shows a warming over the past two hundred years.
Perhaps because the press release was excessive, this announcement caused great controversy. But, as Fred Singer points out in his comments following an editorial in Nature, this should be no surprise because all groups, with some modifications, rely on the same basic data set – the Global Historical Climatology Network produced by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Singer has further comments in an op-ed scheduled for publication early next week.
BEST is to be congratulated for undertaking its difficult task without government support or involvement of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Further, the team has posted its methodology and data for independent review – an action sorely lacking in climate science. Muller’s op-ed goes on to state that BEST drew no conclusions as to cause. The only record analyzed is the land surface record, not the atmospheric or sea surface record. Seas cover about 71% of the earth’s surface and will be the subject of the next project. Muller also stated that the human component in warming may be overstated.
Among the more surprising findings, subjects in separate papers, are that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is slight and that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may have a greater impact on land surface temperatures than the El Niño Southern Oscillation. No doubt the papers and the statistical techniques used will be subject to independent scrutiny. Ocean oscillations are ignored in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the latest report.
Commentators in a number of newspapers, such as the Washington Post and other news media, immediately proclaimed that the BEST study is proof that those labeled climate skeptics / deniers are wrong and they are anti-science. In so doing, many of these commentators committed two major logical fallacies, the strawman argument and petitio principii. One, these commentators misstated the position of most skeptics who challenge the findings of the IPCC and state that climate / temperature change is normal and natural. Two, the commentators assumed that late 20th century warming is proof of human cause while the challengers demand compelling evidence that human emissions of carbon dioxide are the cause of 20th century warming.
Science is built using, among other tools, rigorous logic. Thus, those who use logical fallacies to label the skeptics / deniers as anti-science are, more correctly, labeling themselves.
Among other objections to the BEST reports, the Nature editorial, and several others, raised the fact that the findings were announced prior to publication in a peer reviewed journal. However, it is the policies of editors of Nature, and many other journals, that have lead to such actions. As evidenced by the difficulties that qualified researchers, such as Richard Lindzen and Roy Spencer, have in getting articles published, the editors of many journals block publication of studies that are contrary to their beliefs (that is, contrary to the pronouncements of the IPCC). Yet, Nature published the “hockey-stick” that directly contradicted a large body of prior scientific work. The fact that the BEST team is willing to make its methodology and data available to all who wish to analyze it, is a greater testament to the seriousness of the work than publication in a journal that reflects the beliefs of the editors.
As of this writing, some analysts are raising issues regarding the BEST data record, particularly the most recent data. On Tuesday, Fred Singer will raise issues concerning the data record at the Santa Fe conference noted above.
Please see Articles #1 and #2, reference links under “Measurement Issues” and the discussion below under “20,000 years of climate change.”
*******
Hidden Influence on the IPCC? Writer Donna Laframboise just published a book exposing the interrelationships among principal members of the IPCC and various environmental groups, such as the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and Greenpeace. In principle, it is the quality of the work that matters, not the associations of the participants. It should not make any difference if the participants are associated with environmental groups, oil companies, tobacco companies, or whatever. But the associations should have been revealed.
Governments have spent tens of billions of dollars of public money based upon the findings of the IPCC. It is difficult to determine that if the governments had known of extensive involvement in the IPCC by those associated with environmental groups; the governments would have spent public funds so freely. Certainly, many of those demanding action on the IPCC’s questionable findings would not be doing so if the participants were associated with oil or tobacco companies.
Ms. Laframboise’s charges are serious, thus the evidence substantiating these charges must be serious. In an article published in the Financial Post, Laframboise accused Rajendra Pachauri of writing forewords to reports by Greenpeace and signing as IPCC Chairman, thus implying IPCC endorsement of the reports. There were direct links to the reports, substantiating the charges. In her review, Judith Curry states that the Kindle version of the book contains numerous links verifying the charges.
If the links in The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert continue to substantiate the charges, then the book is starkly different from Merchants of Doubt. In the latter book, authors Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway level very serious charges against four distinguished scientists, three of whom are dead. The authors fail to provide the evidence needed to substantiate the very serious charges. Instead, they cover their failure with extensive footnotes that do not directly address the issues. One book is an exposé, the other, a smear.
It should be remembered that IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is associated with Greenpeace, tried to suppress Fred Singer’s talk in Brussels this past September, forcing a change in venue. IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele falsely claimed Singer is associated the fossil fuel industry.

Number of the Week: 15 out of 44 – 34%: The number of chapters in the IPCC – AR4 that at least one of the coordinating lead authors was affiliated with WWF (World Wildlife Fund) as reported by Donna Laframboise and cited by Judith Curry. Please see links under “Questioning the Orthodoxy.”
*******
Extreme Weather: In a privately produced paper, “Gross Errors in the IPCC – AR4 Report Regarding Past & Future Changes in Global Tropical Cyclone Activity,” noted tropical cyclone (hurricane) expert William Gray challenges the findings in AR4 that warming will produce more intense storms, especially tropical cyclones (which are called hurricanes in the Atlantic). Gray specifically rebuts numerous statements found in AR4, particularly in Chapter 3, “Observations: Surface and Atmospheric Climate Change.” The Coordinating Lead Authors of the chapter are Kevin Trenberth and Philip Jones. Both gained notoriety in the Climategate emails by expressing a willingness to suppress contradicting research.
Gray claims that none of the lead authors have a particular expertise in the field of tropical cyclones, and that many of the conclusions are contradicted by observations. Gray’s writing is quite blunt.
Hopefully, Gray’s paper will not be ignored because the issue is extremely significant and needs to be fully addressed. Organizations such as the US EPA have claimed that global warming endangers human health and welfare because, in part, it will result in more intense storms, especially hurricanes in the US.
Please see links under “Challenging the Orthodoxy.”
*******
20,000 Years of Climate Change: In a recent paper, Svante Björck states that over the past 20,000 years there has been no uniform, global warming and cooling until recently, thus human emissions of carbon dioxide must be the cause. As TWTW has pointed out, uniform global warming does not exist now. Thirty years of satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures show the warming is concentrated in the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere, with little or no warming in the Tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.
Björck’s findings are contradicted by the large body of studies showing both a Medieval Warm Period and a Little Ice Age. These studies can be found in the NIPCC Reports 2009 and 2011 as well as the NIPCC web site and the web site of Sherwood, Craig, and Keith Idso, CO2 Science.org.
On the web site of Anthony Watts, Don Easterbrook produced the most devastating rebuttal. He shows a graph covering the last 20,000 years compiled from proxy temperature measurements from GRIP-2 ice cores taken in Greenland. The graph shows drastic, abrupt temperature changes for the periods immediately preceding, including, and immediately following the Younger Dryas. Directly contradicting Björck, Easterbrook then shows similar abrupt changes for the same period from ice cores taken from glaciers around the world. The graph of Greenland ice cores should be required viewing for anyone claiming 20th century warming is unprecedented.

Comment On The Quality Of The 2007 IPCC WG1 Report In Response To A Post On Climate Etc
By Roger Pielke, Sr, Pielke Climate Science, Oct 20, 2011 [H/t Marc Morano, Climate Depot]
http://pielkeclimatesci.wordpress.com/2011/10…
“The 2007 IPCC WG1 report ignored peer-reviewed papers which conflicts with their narrow focus on the radiative forcing of CO2 and a few other greenhouse gases.
The 2007 IPCC WG1, in my view, was a failure in the assessment of the understanding of the human role in the climate system, as well as the extent to which the natural forcings and feedbacks influence the climate.”

http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2011/oct/…
The two researchers of this paper list numerous problems that hamper decadal climate predictability, among which is the fact that “the models suffer from large biases”…
Primary Production in the Bering Sea

http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2011/oct/…
“Rather than declining,” as the three U.S. (Stanford University) researchers of this study report, they found that mean annual sea ice extent in the Bering Sea “has exhibited no significant change over the satellite sea ice record (1979-2009),” because, as they discovered, significant warming during the satellite sea surface temperature record (1982-2009) “is mainly limited to the summer months”…

"Every country in the world would be economically better off if all could agree to strengthen their commitments on the climate crisis through international cooperation, new research has found. But if countries go no further than their current CO2 pledges – which are too weak to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, and would lead to dangerous levels of global heating – then they face steep economic losses.  The global economy would lose out by as much as $600tn (£476tn) by the end of the century, on current emissions targets, compared with its likely growth if countries meet the Paris goals, according to a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. If countries fail even to implement their current plans – which would lead to an estimated 3C (5.4F) of heating, far beyond the 2C or 1.5C settled on as the limit of safety in the 2015 Paris agreement – then the outlook is even worse, with losses of up to $800tn by 2100, according to the report from a group of scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology and other mainly Chinese institutions. The study’s authors call their findings a “self-preservation strategy” for governments. They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown. However, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term. Their findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts. Many are under pressure to ignore or roll back previous commitments on the climate, and some stricken industries with high emissions – such as airlines and carmakers – have lobbied for a weakening of green measures. Oil producers have called a truce in their price war. But reneging on green commitments now only stores up future problems, and will hasten climate breakdown, scientists have warned, and any respite from rising emissions caused by the crisis will be only temporary. All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before vital UN climate talks aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track. The UN and the UK government have been forced to delay the talks, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called nationally determined contributions in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year’s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan’s plan showed no improvement. A UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: “We welcome Chile’s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see all countries following their lead.” Current climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Budgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations – it’s the fair and right thing to do. If we don’t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time.  “And it’s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn’t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.” The economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study’s authors. However, investments are needed to realise these gains, particularly from developed countries. The outlay would amount to between $5tn and $33tn for the US, and between $16tn and $105tn for the G20 countries as a whole. The study said: “Early and quick action will provide a better chance to close the widening emissions gap, even though a large amount of abatement cost would occur in the short term.”"
"

25,000 bureaucrats, factota, hangers on, and representatives of various environmental organizations have just converged on Copenhagen for the UN’s latest “Conference of the Parties (COP) to its infamous 1992 climate treaty. Expect a lot of heat, not much light, and a punt right into our next election.   
  
  
President Obama says that the US will agree to a “politically binding” reduction of our emissions of carbon dioxide to a mere 17% of 2005 levels by 2050. This will allow the average American the carbon dioxide emission of the average citizen in 1867. Obama’s pronouncement has stepped all over the toes of the US Senate, which really doesn’t want to vote on similar legislation this election year. Jim Webb, a democrat heretofore very loyal to the President recently wrote Obama a very tersely worded note reminding him that the power to commit the nation to such a regulation lies with the Senate, not with the Commander‐​in‐​Chief.   
  
  
The UN’s own climate models show that even if every nation that has obligations under the failed Kyoto Protocol (which is supposed to be replaced by the Copenhagen Protocol) did what Obama wants, that only 7% of prospective warming would be prevented by 2100. The world’s largest emitter—China—was exempt then, and won’t agree to these reductions now.   
  
  
Instead they will agree to reduce “carbon intensity”—the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit GDP—by 20% per decade. This is nothing but business as usual for a developing or robust economy. In fact, when President George W. Bush said that was our global warming policy, he was roundly booed. The Chinese announcement—already telegraphed, is being greeted with unmitigated praise by the same environmentalists who beat on Bush for the exact same policy. India has just announced that there is no way that they will agree to any emission reductions unless we pay them lotsa money. Obama thinks that’s a good idea, too. Polling data, anyone?   
  
  
Since there’s no way that India and China will agree to large reductions, the real result of Copenhagen is that the climate can will be kicked down the road to the next COP, which begins on November 8, 2010, right down the road in Mexico City. That’s six days after our Congressional election, guaranteeing that cap‐​and‐​tax will be on the voters’ minds when they close the curtain on the current Congress.

Newsbytes from Dr. Benny Peiser at The Global Warming Policy Foundation 
 
A diplomatic cable published last month by the WikiLeaks website reveals that most of the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in India should not have been certified because they did not reduce emissions beyond those that would have been achieved without foreign investment. Indian officials have apparently known about the problem for at least two years. The revelations imply that millions of tonnes of claimed reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions are mere phantoms, she says, and potentially cast doubt over the principle of carbon trading. —Quirin Schiermeier, Nature News, 27 September 2011 

 
But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy. Obviously, the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore. –Ottmar Edenhoffer, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, 14 November 2010 
 
North Sea gas production has slumped by 25% in the second quarter of the year, an alarming increase in the rate of decline that will cut tax revenues and could put more pressure on government to agree controversial shale gas developments. —Terry Macalister, The Guardian, 30 September 2011 
 
The costs of Alex Salmond’s green energy revolution are “going through the roof” and threaten to bankrupt companies by doubling energy bills, business leaders have warned the First Minister. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) said electricity is currently about nine times more expensive to generate from wind farms than gas-powered plants. It warned this would hold back the Scottish economy and lead to businesses going under. –Simon Johnson, The Daily Telegraph, 29 September 2011 
 
 
 
Poland would veto any EU legislation that threatened its sovereignty in energy policy, Maciej Olex-Szczytowski, an adviser to the Polish foreign minister on economics and business, said yesterday. —Bloomberg, 28 September 2011 
 
In an age of austerity, cheap gas—domestically produced and available in large quantities—could be a major tool for restoring European prosperity. It allows EU member states to directly tackle their alarming growth of fuel poverty while providing a new means to help rebuild competitiveness. That is an investment no country in Europe can afford not to make. –-Alan Riley, The Wall Street Journal, 30 September 2011 
The shale boom of oil & gas is one of the few bright spots in the Obama economy. So it seems more than a bit paradoxical that Obama’s EPA and Department of the Interior continue working in attempts to find an excuse to shut it down — or at least slow it to a crawl. —Al Fin Energy, 29 September 2011

"More than 20 years ago, the university department where I was doing my PhD was fire bombed by animal rights activists. At the time, I was conducting research into animal welfare, as were many of the staff in my department. I found it hard to understand why a research department whose main objective was to improve the well-being of animals would be the target for such an attack. I suspect most people, as I did then, see animal welfare and animal rights as synonyms. In reality, however, they are at opposite ends of the continuum concerning our treatment of animals. Proponents of animal welfare are interested in questions like: “How can we improve the well-being of zoo animals?” Whereas animal rights supporters ask questions like: “Should we have zoos?”  These are very different questions with diametrically opposed outcomes: the constant improvement of zoos or their closing down. Both could be argued to improve animal well-being, but one is highly pragmatic, whereas the other is philosophical. Accepting and working with the status quo that animals are used for important research or housed in zoos for conservation purposes, my job as an animal welfare scientist is to maximise their well-being in these situations. Much of my work is based on the ideas of the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham who famously said of animals and their well-being: The question is not: ‘Can they reason?’ Nor: ‘Can they talk?’ But: ‘Can they suffer?’ Bentham, importantly, put the focus on the practical question of suffering, moving the debate away from human-animal comparisons, and brought in the concept of a cost-benefit analysis.  Human activities affect the well-being of animals to different degrees and society uses Bentham’s cost-benefit analysis to determine whether what we are doing is acceptable. For example, treatments for diabetes were developed on animals in laboratories. These, animals paid the cost with theirs lives and, consequently, hundreds of millions of people, presently, benefit from a treatment for a terrible disease. This cost-benefit analysis is enshrined in many laws relating to animal welfare. The role of animal welfare scientists is, on a practical level, to improve animal well-being. On a philosophical level, it accepts some of the ways that human activity impinges on the well-being of animals and works to minimise their cost and maximise the benefits to them.  From this perspective, it can be argued that animal welfare research justifies the continued use of animals by humans, be it for research, for food or in zoos. The support for the continued use of animals for scientific purposes is a particular cause of conflict with animal rights activists – hence why my university department was fire bombed. I believe we should do our utmost to improve constantly the conditions of animals affected by human activities. Like animal rights advocates, my concern is to improve the lot of animals. But, while their approach is to abolish the use of animals, my approach is to work with animal industries. We take a pragmatic stance that it is impossible for modern society to function without using animals – be it for food or for medical research. Most people I suspect have sympathy for the welfare and rights approach, depending on the issue at hand. I, for example, would not support research to improve the wellbeing of whales being hunted for scientific or other purposes. There is, in my opinion, no humane way to kill whales and I disagree with exploiting highly sentient animals when the capacity to suffer seems to be linked to cognitive abilities. But I have to admit when the use of animals affects my life directly then I am more likely to support an animal welfare approach. In the past few years, several members of my family have had life-threatening conditions and all have survived due to medical care based on research using animals. Therefore my interest in this subject derives from what John Stuart Mills called “enlightened self-interest” – that is, we have a moral obligation to take care of the animals who improve our well-being. Just like voting for a political party, before you pin your flag to one cause or another be sure you understand the implication of your choice and that you are prepared to live with it. This might be animals being held in imperfect conditions, but conditions that are improving, or a world without zoos and limited medical advances."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber spoke at the Stakeholders Conference on the 2015 Agreement last week.
You can watch him speak from the 2:30 – 37:00 mark. He made a couple of surprising statements.

Schellnhuber starts off by claiming that media reports saying there’s no consensus are false and are only designed to spread confusion.
He claims that there is no dispute about CO2 trapping heat. But that’s just a diversion from the real issue: CO2 sensitivity and feedbacks. Of course CO2 is a greenhouse gas. But the question is: How much warming will a doubling of CO2 lead to? Not much, or a lot? That’s what is being hotly debated. A number of recent peer-reviewed studies and data are showing that the warming indeed will be small.
But to keep the climate catastrophe scenario alive, Schellnhuber in his speech cherry-picks only the literature that supports a massive warming. He ignores all the other papers that show significantly reduced sensitivity and natural factors.
Concedes warming has stopped, blames the oceans
At the 10-minute mark, Schellnhuber thinks he can use the totally discredited Marcott paper to support the AGW theory! The clueless audience is wowed by it. One has to ask if Schellnhuber is maliciously misleading his audience, or is he totally disconnected from reality and unaware that the Marcott paper is worthless?
At the 11:25 mark, he concedes that warming has paused, calling it “a slowdown“. He says the pause is due to hidden planetary mechanisms that are stealing and hiding the heat. In the presentation he says the warming is there – if you ignore the cooling.
At the 12:30 mark Schellnhuber says that the warming in fact “didn’t really pause, but slowed“. He blames the missing warming on the La Nina’s of the 2000s sucking up the heat. “Something is going on in the ocean. […] We haven’t identified all the mechanisms yet.” The oceans have eaten the “tremendous” heat, he explains.
Actually this may be Schellnhuber finally admitting the role of the oceans for the first time. If he blames the oceans for absorbing heat and cooling the planet for the last 10 years, then he also has to concede that they can also release heat and cause warming – as was the case from the period of 1975 – 2000 when the AMO and PDO indexes rose.
You can’t blame the oceans only when it cools, and CO2 when it warms. Time for Schellnhuber to build oceanic cycles into the models.
Concedes that we may have another decade of slowdown!
Remarkably at the 16:40 mark he concedes:
We may have another decade of warming slowdown.”

Professor Schellnhuber, another 10 years would mean a quarter of a century without warming. Not one single model predicted that. The models that you are now relying on for your catastrophic scenarios are therefore rubbish. You are not going to find a single buyer out there.
In a debate Schellnhuber would not survive the first 10 minutes.
Singles out the Economist
At the about the 17:45 mark, Schellnhuber goes after the Economist for daring to question alarmist science. Notice how he looked down at his notes, revealing he had made it a point to do so.
By the way, there has been a lot of talk…the eminent leading climate scientist who sits on the editorial board at the Economist…that was a joke, you may laugh… ha ha, have actually said that climate sensitivity is smaller than we thought.”
How dare the unqualified Economist question the authoritative scientists?
Finally, at about the 20-minute mark, he begins with all the future catastrophic scenarios that await us. He shows a chart depicting 8°C of warming by the year 2200.
This of course means “the global organs will be pushed to destabilization and collapse“. You see, “tremendous amounts of heat are being processed by the planetary machinery” and will come back (after our lifetimes) with a vengeance.
What a con-job.
Dignity or death…9 billion people are too much
At about the 8:30 mark he shows a graphic depicting the climate over the last 100,000 years, correctly stating that the natural climate is often very unstable and that the last 10,000 years have been a “grace period” for mankind. But eerily he asks the audience:
Can we expect in such a wildly fluctuating climate to support 9 billion lives in dignity? Don’t think so.”
What he means by this is open to interpretation. But let’s recall that he once said the optimum population for the planet is about 1 billion, and that “at 9 billion the planet would explode.”

Yesterday I wrote about Hans von Storch’s and Werner Krauss’s new book: “The Climate Trap – the dangerous proximity of politics and climate science”.
There is already some reaction to the book, which is scheduled to be released on February 25…a little over a year since Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning dropped their bombshell “Die kalte Sonne“ (The Cold Sun), which tells us claims of a coming climate catastrophe are unfounded.
The publisher Hanser Verlag writes:
The climate conferences have ended in failure and achieved no consequences, even though emissions continue rising. Climate scientist Hans von Storch and cultural scientist Werner Krauss explain how we ended up in the climate trap – and how we can get out of it. The inflationary announcements of the climate catastrophe led to a loss of credibility in science. Climate change is not a scientific question, but a societal one. It has to be anchored regionally in culture, every-day life, and politics. Global society does not need any politicized science calling for a 2°C target. Instead it needs a science that fathoms the conditions for a pragmatic approach to climate change.”
Reimar Lüst, former president of the Max Planck Society here:
This is an unusual and provocative book. A natural scientist and a cultural scientist have written it together. Hopefully it will annoy both the climate deniers and the climate alarmists within their insular circles.”
If it indeed annoys the alarmists, which I’m sure it will, then very few “deniers” will be annoyed at all by it. We can take criticism.

Gerhard Traufetter of Der Spiegel here:
Hans von Storch is a pioneer in climate modeling and one of the cool-headed voices on the subject. For years he has been dealing with the role of climate scientists, and has sharply criticised that some of them have attempted to drive policy with their research results. Together with cultural scientist Werner Krauss, he is calling for a clear designation of roles: Climate scientists should concentrate on physics and make themselves available to policymakers as ‘honest brokers’.”
Patrick Bahners of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  here:
Hans von Storch doesn’t call for an immediate meteorological state of emergency whenever a snowstorm does not allow itself to be stopped by all the chicanery of environmental law. The realists among the climate scientists are not guaranteeing good weather, but are guaranteeing clear views.”
Again there are lots of indications the book has plenty of harsh criticism aimed at the alarmist scientists who are trying to shape politics. Step by step, voices are speaking out against unfounded climate catastrophism in Germany.
Good news!

You would think that the reporters at _Stuff_ would be familiar with all the Scientific terms related to the environment and climate but you would be wrong.



In [this article,](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/114450665/earth-overshoot-day-kiwis-consume-a-years-worth-of-resources-in-five-months) the reporter seems to have misheard what was said to them and as a result, gets it completely wrong.



 **“buyer capacity”** should be **[“biocapacity”](https://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/biocapacity.htm)**[ ](https://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/biocapacity.htm) It is- used incorrectly twice.



She also noted that we’re still an “oil-based society”, but our **buyer capacity** has “drastically reduced”.  




“In the early 60s, we were sitting at 18gha… and now we’re at nine.. we’ve halved our **buyer capacity** and that’s what helps us to push those overshoot days to later in the year.”

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I wrote previously about the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol. In that post, I pointed out an underlying irony of the CDM. At the behest of European AGW supporters who would never, ever think of allowing the building of a hydroelectric dam in their own country, European money is being sent to China where it is used to build … hydroelectric dams.
Of course, it being part of the UN, there’s always more to the CDM story. In this case the “more” is provided by Wikileaks, in particular a diplomatic cable that discussed the CDM in India. The fraud revealed in the cable was so egregious, in fact, that even the AGW supporting Scientific American said:
… most of the carbon-offset projects in India fail to meet the CDM requirements set by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
So most of the projects that were funded, shouldn’t have been funded. OK, it’s a private-sector scam within a UN scam. Insert your preferred expression of surprise here, along with the required quote from Casablanca.
So far, no big shocks, we find that a UN project is corrupt root and branch, be still my beating heart. But it raised a different question in my mind. Which CDM requirements couldn’t the Indian projects meet? I mean, these are Indian businessmen, I’d have said there was no requirement that they couldn’t figure out how to meet (or at a minimum pretend to meet) … so what was the regulation that was laying them low? The leaked cable contains the Kafkaesque answer.

The hurdle that the Indian projects couldn’t get over is something I hadn’t heard of called the “additionality criteria”. This says the project has to be something that is additional, something that wouldn’t otherwise happen without the CDM assistance. The Kyoto Protocol says that projects that would occur without CDM assistance are not “additional”, and so they should not be certified as emission reductions. Or as the leaked cable puts it in delightful bureaucratese:
(Note:  The  project has to prove that it does not use commonly-available  technology and that it is unviable without carbon credit revenue.  End Note.)
Now that the note has ended, stop and consider that for a moment … the project has to use unusual, cutting edge, novel technology, and it has to be a project that would fail without the CDM.
If I set out to make some guidelines for assistance to emission reduction technologies, those seem like the polar opposite of the guidelines I would make.
First, why not allow the use of proven, reliable, available emission reduction technologies along with unusual, cutting edge technologies with no track record? Instead of reducing emissions, aren’t you reducing your chances of success way, way down by only allowing what may not work?
Second, why fund projects that are “unviable”, as the jargon would have it, if you don’t assist them? As a businessman, the idea of specifically selecting a project for funding on the basis that it absolutely won’t work without free money is … well … it would be hilarious if it weren’t so tragic. The regulation requires that you pick incipient losers, ideas guaranteed to go belly-up unless you shower them with largesse … which seems to this boy like a very poor way to pick winners.
Given those requirements, I can now understand why the majority of the Indian projects “fail to meet the CDM requirements set by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.”
It’s because the CDM requirements are set up so that only impending failures can have a hope of success.
Did I mention Kafka? Perhaps I was thinking of Catch-22 …
In any case, this whole idea of offsetting your carbon sins by paying carbon indulgences seems like a killer idea, it puts the Nigerian 419 scams to shame. My plan is to bring this same brilliant concept to the masses by extending the whole theory of carbon offsets and “carbon neutrality” to encompass sexual fidelity.
Here’s the scheme in all of its beauty: if you want to cheat on your wife or husband, you pay me a fee. I split the fee with one of my employees (actually independent contractors, if anyone is looking for work) who promises not to cheat on their wife or husband for the same amount of time that you have paid for. That way, for a small fee (payable by cash, cheque, or credit card) you can rest assured that your extra-marital actions are “fidelity neutral”.
Makes as much sense as the CDM process, and it would likely make more money. Hey, maybe I could even get some free CDM bucks … oh, wait, I’d have to overcome the “additionality criteria” …

"Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet. Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”, with most international travel currently frozen in the Covid-19 crisis. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to amend the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (Corsia), or risk airlines pulling out. Under the system, airlines have to pay to offset any growth in carbon emissions above a baseline set by the average emissions of 2019 and 2020. The grounding of aircraft during the pandemic means the baseline will be far lower than envisaged, and the carbon targets much more challenging, if Corsia goes ahead without changes. Iata has told ICAO that the baseline “must be adjusted to ensure the sustainable development of international aviation and avoid an inappropriate economic burden on the sector”. It said some nations could pull out of the agreement if the costs were too high. Before the Covid-19 crisis, estimates showed that airlines were likely to have to spend between £4bn and £18bn a year globally on carbon credits by 2035 to satisfy the Corsia rules. A report by the Green Alliance, before the coronavirus lockdown, found that this was not enough to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement. The ICAO council had signed off on the Corsia plans on 13 March, gaining plaudits from green campaigners for sticking with its pledges on the climate crisis instead of shelving them in the face of the pandemic. However, airlines’ commitment now looks distinctly shaky. The US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a long-time mover behind the Corsia scheme, argued that the existing Corsia rules allowed enough flexibility for governments to address the “suppressed activity in 2020, without any need to renegotiate the measure in a drawn-out political discussion”. James Elliott, a Green Alliance policy adviser, said: “Calls to reduce burdens on the [aviation] sector as it recovers are understandable. But the climate emergency also presents an urgent challenge which must be addressed. If the sector cannot find ways to rebuild itself sustainably after the Covid-19 crisis, it will face painful disruption again in the future as its part in the climate emergency has to be addressed. “If Corsia is amended, it must be done in a way which also strengthens its ambition, with targets to limit and reduce actual emissions levels.” Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “At the same time as they’re asking for huge government bailouts, airlines are also lobbying furiously to dodge their obligations towards cutting carbon emissions. “Offsetting schemes have always been big polluters’ favourite excuse to carry on polluting while shifting responsibility for their emissions to someone else. The industry’s current proposal would only make the buck-passing easier.” Iata denied that it was backing away from Corsia. Its director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: “We haven’t given up our environmental goals … After the recovery we will continue to reduce emissions and noise footprints – that hasn’t changed. “This crisis is a matter of survival for the industry … We are asking governments for urgent help. Of course we will comply with our environmental obligations. Before that, we have to survive – or there will be no issue with the environment, the industry will have disappeared.”"

I would like to consider myself a handyman. If something needs fixing I’ll give it a go. And then my beloved will engage plan B and call in an expert to rectify the worsening situation. It is accepted that most of us rely on specialists to ensure a task is completed appropriately. If I want a boil lanced on my bum, I would go to a doctor not an electrician, if you get my drift. So when did Milly Adams, a local hairdresser, who was elected to council simply because her surname started with an “A”, become a climatologist? 



If I wanted to know what the weather was like over the next few days I might give Daniel Corbett a ring. If I wanted to know what the weather will be in ten years time, it appears I only need to give Councilor Milly a call. That is how absurd the “climate emergency” declarations have become.



These people who crave notoriety by declaring such nonsense are at the lower end of the food chain when it comes to intellectual endeavour within the communities they serve. The vast majority of said communities wouldn’t have a clue who represents them, let alone trust them to assimilate their constituent’s collective consciousness.



So a message to all councilors: **keep our streets clean, our parks flourishing, our sewers flowing, our roads open, provide water we can drink, ensure rubbish is disposed of, provide public transport that is punctual and frequent, mow our berms, speed up resource consent approvals and the many other housekeeping responsibilities you are charged with.**



We pay you to deliver these services. Be virtuous at your own expense and in your own time, not ours. Now get back to work and do what we are paying you to do. And emotionally grow up. The only things frying are your collective brains.

"The long, black hem of Ibado Mohammed Abdulle’s diya drags in the sand, creating mini tornadoes of dust under her sandals. At a circular fence of waist-high thorny bushes, she knocks on the metal sheet serving as a makeshift door. A woman’s face, partially hidden by a bright green hijab, appears. “Salaam Alaikum,” Abdulle says, “peace be upon you.” Holding up a hand to the armed guards tasked with accompanying the visiting charity staff following her around the displacement camp, she instructs them to stay outside.  “We don’t want to scare her,” she says. Abdulle, 48, was living in the desert town of Oog in northern Somalia in 2016 when drought turned the region to dust, driving thousands of families from their homes. Now she makes daily visits to one of three sprawling displacement camps outside the town to campaign for vulnerable women and girls. Once a climate refugee herself, she knows what their lives are like. “I tell them to gather in groups when they go out,” Abdulle says. “That most of the men are your enemies, so don’t go out alone so you can be safe from the violence and the rape, especially at night-time.” In Somalia, climate change is driving rape, sexual violence and intimate partner violence. Droughts linked to climate change ravage the landscape with increasing frequency, hurting families who depend on farming and herding animals. The spike in regional violence against women and girls takes two forms: domestic violence against women who have become family breadwinners , and sexual violence against women and girls who have migrated to camps near crowded urban centres. Abdulle came from a pastoralist family, displaced by drought and conflict during Somalia’s civil war in the 80s. After a nomadic life with her family, Abdulle was sent to the capital city, Mogadishu, for her education. She returned first to her parents in northern Somalia, and then moved to Oog. “When my family [lived] in the countryside, we had a drought like this one [in 2016],” Abdulle says. “The people were helped. Some were educated, some worked and some of them went abroad. I know something about the droughts. When the droughts come, there can be good change for the people, especially for women.” In 2016, when waves of displaced pastoralist families streamed into Oog, looking for healthcare, food, water and shelter, Abdulle felt compelled to document the crisis and to protect and empower women and girls. She recorded videos to send to the government and the Somali diaspora, requesting support for the overwhelming need. Abdulle’s no-nonsense attitude and unrelenting commitment encouraged the community to approach the local government to request she be put in charge of their welfare. Holding a paid leadership position overseeing men is an usual responsibility for a woman in Somalia’s male-dominated society. “The surprising thing is that the three male heads of the three IDP camps are … happy that Ibado is above them,” said Muna Hussein, a gender officer at Oxfam, who works closely with Abdulle. “They listen to her.” Camp conditions are hazardous for women: there is no lighting at night, and no doors or fences to keep out opportunistic criminals and predators. As drought continued in 2017 and 2018, the population in Oog’s camps boomed. And crimes against women and girls mounted. While updated statistics are hard to come by, at least 25% of Somali women have experienced gender-based violence exacerbated by conflict and displacement due to the climate emergency, World Bank data shows. Much of this violence happens in displaced communities. Research from Oxfam suggests women in Somalia are most at risk when walking to collect water and firewood, using outdoor toilets and sleeping in makeshift huts that lack doors and lighting. The perpetrators come from both inside and outside the camps. The government, fragile and under-resourced, cannot provide protection and services to the nearly 2.6 million Somalis already displaced. Abdulle has sought to help local women and girls protect themselves by organising groups to collect water and firewood. She has also coordinated forums, groups of volunteers who meet to learn how to campaign for their needs and rights. She also acts as a counsellor and friend for women who have been attacked. “If a girl who was raped came to me, I would start by speaking with her,” Abdulle says. “Then, I would take her to the hospital for any treatment. And I would take her to the nearest police station immediately to arrest the perpetrator of this crime.” In the blazing afternoon sun, with strong winds kicking up fierce dust storms, the makeshift tents in the displacement camp look identical: round huts propped up by sticks and covered in a patchwork of faded, old cloth. But Abdulle knows the women living in each one and navigates between the huts with ease. Sukhra Idris, her name changed to protect her privacy, lives alone in this camp with her two children. When Abdulle enters, she greets her with a hug. The lines around her eyes make Idris look older than her 23 years. She was married at 17 to a man from a wealthy family. “I met a boy and fell in love and felt I was ready for marriage,” Idris says, pulling up the bright green hijab as her young child tugs from her head. “I was in a hurry for that because I was very young.” When the 2016 drought hit, the couple’s livestock transportation business was ruined. . According to experts, men unable to provide for their families often become more prone to domestic violence. Idris says her husband began to abuse her, slamming her against a wall, punching and slapping her. “I told him to do his own work because we didn’t have enough to eat and needed to support old people like my mom and dad,” said Idris. “At that time, he was beating me if I asked him to bring milk for his kids.” Idris tried several times to leave, but social stigma pressed her to return. It was only with Abdulle’s support that Idris was able to leave for good. She struggles to survive with her children in the displacement camp and one has died from diarrhoea. After a long day, Abdulle visits Oog’s only hotel to sit beneath the shade of a tree and sip a cup of camel milk tea. With climate change intensifying and droughts increasing in the region, Abdulle knows she alone cannot meet the overwhelming needs of all Somali women and girls. Her greatest hope is that the displaced women she is helping to train and empower will pick up the fight."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Washington Post lashes out at Europe’s failure to impose a continent-wide cap and trade scheme designed to make carbon fuels more expensive, calling European governments “incompetent central planners” and the continent as a whole a “green energy basket-case“.
The Post laments that Europe has blown a big opportunity to become a greener economy.
I can’t think of a single central planning endeavor that ever has been competent. The Post writes:
FOR YEARS, European leaders have flaunted their unwavering commitment to fighting climate change — and chastised the United States for lagging behind. But last week brought yet more confirmation that the continent has become a green-energy basket case.
[…] the market for carbon permits has all but collapsed. […] European governments have proved themselves to be incompetent central planners…

The Post also writes that the US “is now burning less coal even as Europe burns more” because of the US’s “practical embrace of natural gas and the continued use of nuclear power.”
Europe, with it’s overzealous campaign and stance against fracking and nuclear power, has maneuvered itself into an impossible energy position. As the Post writes, Europe is showing the world what not to do.

"**The Republic of Ireland's cabinet has agreed to reopen all retail outlets, hairdressers, museums and libraries from Tuesday of next week.**
Ireland has been in lockdown for nearly six weeks, with rules similar to those in spring, except schools stayed open and construction continued.
From 1 December, people will also be able to attend religious services and play golf and tennis again.
They will not be allowed to leave their county except for essential reasons.
That would include work, education or a medical appointment.
On Friday next week - 4 December - restaurants and pubs that have a kitchen and serve food will reopen.
However, pubs that do not serve food will remain closed except for delivery or take-away services.
From Friday, 18 December until 6 January people will be allowed to travel to visit family and friends, but only three households can gather.
It is understood the government will revist the issue of travel to Northern Ireland closer to 18 December.
It had been reported that TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Leo Varadkar had advised against cross-border travel to Northern Ireland at Christmas.
However, Mr Varadkar clarified on Thursday that there was ""no question of there being an outright travel ban between north and south"".
The three-party coalition government is continuing to advise people to wear masks in crowded outdoor areas during the festive season.
New rules are also expected on the distance between tables in premises and a reduction in the amount of time people can stay there.
It follows a five-hour meeting on Thursday night of the Covid-19 cabinet sub-committee.
Ministers made their decisions despite advice from public health officials that they should choose between either opening restaurants and pubs that serve food and allowing household visits.
It is understood that the cabinet, which had access to its own research, believes its proposals take on board some of those concerns while allowing people to have ""a meaningful Christmas"".
Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin is expected to make a national address during the RTÃ TV evening news."

When Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the political left wasted no time gibbering about a “return to the 1930s”. In one sense, they were right: for the first time since the 1930s, black-masked paramilitaries are enacting a reign of violent terror in the streets. Even worse, anti-Semitism is on a disturbing rise.



What the left didn’t tell us was that it was **them** leading the charge back into the Dark Valley of the 30s.



What has caused the deeply alarming upsurge in antisemitism across the West? As many have observed, there are three principal sources: the political left, Islamic culture and neo-fascist or white-supremacist cults.



One further factor, though, is crucial.



The left is excusing anti-Semitism where it suits them.



Antisemitism can be kept to a low level by condign social disapproval that deems antisemites to be totally beyond the pale.



If, however, that social stigma is lifted and society tolerates, excuses or sanitizes antisemitism, then it roars out of control.



British lawyer Mark Lewis said, “Jeremy Corbyn moved the rock, and the anti-Semites crawled out from underneath the rock”. Corbyn didn’t **make** Labour anti-Semitic: he just gave the Jew-haters in the party the all-clear.



That’s precisely what is now happening. In America, astoundingly, it is **being facilitated and mainstreamed by Democratic Party grandees.**



Many of the Democrats’ rising stars are **blatantly anti-Semitic**. Keith Ellison, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar all have an undeniable track record of anti-Semitic comments and associating with vicious anti-Semites. Women’s March organiser Linda Sarsour is another anti-Semite, with documented links to Islamist organisations. **The Democrat party backs them to the hilt.**



Instead of treating [Tlaib] as a pariah to be shunned, the Democrats have circled the wagons around her…It was Pelosi’s defense of her remarks that was outrageous. Worse, this is now part of a pattern by Pelosi of sanitizing and normalizing Islamic antisemitism.



Although Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar accused Israel of “hypnotizing the world” and prayed that “Allah awaken the people and help them see [Israel’s] evil doings,” Pelosi appointed her to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And after Omar claimed that Jews use their money to suborn American politicians in the interests of Israel, Pelosi played down the remark.



 **She also invited a radical Islamist imam, Omar Suleiman, to deliver the noon prayer in Congress.**



The British left is no better.



A major part of the problem is that this derangement is by no means confined to the supporters of Labour’s far-left leader Jeremy Corbyn. This was shown by last weekend’s revolting anti-Israel hate-fest in London. Chanting demonstrators brandished posters declaring that Jews control the media, Jews are the new Nazis, Jews have no right to a state, Jews bring antisemitism upon themselves and so on.



Yet faced with this chilling display, the media could barely bring itself to shrug.



Then, of course, there is NZ’s own [Golriz Ghahraman](https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-zealand-lawmaker-says-jesus-mother-was-palestinian-refugee/), not to mention the outbreaks of leftist anti-Semitism in Australia.



Yet, the left continues to delude itself that it is, by definition, “anti-racist”. So, why is anti-Jewish racism so horrifyingly prevalent on the left? Because their signature cause, their article of faith, is fundamentally anti-Semitic.



Progressive people refuse to acknowledge that their signature Palestinian cause — so revealingly exposed by the mind-bending distortions of Rashida Tlaib — is the new antisemitism.



And that’s because they refuse to acknowledge that **Palestinianism itself is fundamentally anti-Jew.**



The media, themselves overwhelmingly leftist, in fact deliberately lie in order to cover up for leftist anti-Semitism.



A Gazan boy says “the revolutionary songs excite you, they encourage you … to rip a Jew’s head off.” But, instead of accurately translating the Arabic word Yahud that he and others used for Jew, the BBC mistranslated it as “Israeli”…this is simply untrue…Denial of Palestinian and Muslim antisemitism is legitimizing, mainstreaming and fueling antisemitism in the West.



When confronted with their own bigotry, people like Tlaib and Suleiman claim that the real problem of antisemitism comes from “the right.”



And which groups in both America and Britain hand them this particular “get out of jail free” card so they can continue to escalate the climate of Jew-hatred? Why, the left, of course — and the Jews.



  
Like Black Americans, too many Jews have stayed rusted-on to the left, even as the left turns overwhelmingly against them. But, like the Black “Walk Away” movement, a growing sub-stratum of Jewish opinion is finally starting to say, “enough is enough”, in a [“Jexodus”](https://worldisraelnews.com/jexodus-to-exodus-movement-to-wean-jews-from-democratic-party-expanding/).

_The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly posts in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.   
  
_The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer-reviewed literature, or that has been peer-screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.   
  
**More Good News About Sea Level Rise**   
  
In the last (and first) installment of _The Current Wisdom_ , I looked at how projections of catastrophic sea level rise—some as high as 20 feet this century—are falling by the wayside as more real-world data comes in. In the last month, there’s been even more hot-off-the-press studies that a) continue to beat down the notion of disastrous inundations, and b) received no media attention whatsoever.   
  
Last month, I featured a new analysis which showed that the calibration scheme for satellite gravity measurements was out of whack, leading to an overestimation loss of glacial ice from Greenland and Antarctica by about 50%.   
  
This time around, there are two brand-new studies which further dampen the fears of rapid sea level rise spawned by a warming climate. The one estimates that about 25% of the current sea level rise has _nothing whatsoever to do with “global warming” from any cause_ , but instead is contributed by our increasing removal of fossil groundwater to suit our growing water demands. And the second estimates that the total sea level rise contribution of one of Antarctica’s biggest outlet glaciers—one which has been called “the weak underbelly” of the massive West Antarctic Ice Sheet—is most likely only going to be about 1/2 _inch_ by the year 2100. Neither met the press, which is why you are reading about them here.   
  
Last month we concluded that “things had better get cooking in a hurry if the real world is going to approach these popular estimates [3 to 20 feet of sea level rise by 2100]. And there are no signs that such a move is underway.” Now, there are even more signs that the massive sea level rise candle is flaming out as rapidly as cap-and-trade in an election year.   
  
A team of scientists from the Netherlands, headed by the appropriately surnamed Yoshihide Wada, have been investigating the magnitude and trends of groundwater usage around the world. For millennia, humans “mined” water under the surface, but the volumes were globally inconsequential.   
  
Wada _et al_. found many regions, including the Midwestern and Southwestern U.S., in which groundwater extraction exceeds groundwater replenishment. Around the world, Wada et al. found that the total excess was about 30 cubic miles per year in 1960, which rose to about 68 by the year 2000.   
  
What on earth does this have to do with sea-level rise?   




Remember that, outside of nuclear reactions, matter is never destroyed. Water taken out of the ground either runs off to a creek and makes it back to the ocean, or it evaporates. Because the total water vapor concentration in the atmosphere is constant (depending upon the average temperature of the water/atmosphere interface), the additional evaporation is available for precipitation, adding to that which runs off.   
  
68 cubic miles of added water to the ocean each year amounts to about three-hundredths of an inch of sea level. Granted, this is a small amount, but (despite the scare headlines emanating from our greener friends), the annual rate of global sea level rise during the past 20 years has only been about 0.12 inches per year. So groundwater extraction accounts for about a quarter (.03/.12) of the current rate of sea level rise.   
  
This is a rather large bite out of the apple of sea level rise, and it means that estimates of just how much sea level rise is being caused by ongoing global warming have to be slashed.   
  
In a much-hyped paper appearing in _Science_ magazine back in early 2007, Stefan Rahmstorf and colleagues (including NASA’s infamous Cassandra James Hansen, the Nouriel Roubini of climatology), proclaimed that sea level rise is occurring at a rate which was at the very high end of the projections from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—fuelling claims that the IPCC sea level rise projections from climate change were too conservative.   
  
(Hansen is also the lonely champion of the notion that sea level will rise 20 feet in the next 89 years. Twenty years ago, he predicted that New York’s Westside Highway would be inundated by _now_.)[1]   
  
If the Rahmstorf _et al_. analysis were updated through 2010 and the impact from groundwater depletion figured in, it would turn out that the observed rate of sea level rise from global warming would fall at or below the IPCC’s mid-range projection which ultimately results in about 15 _inches_ of sea level rise by 2100. Such a finding of course would ignite very little hype—which is why you are reading it here.   
  
Ah, but you say, don’t the global warming doomsayers tell us that the rate of sea level rise will accelerate rapidly as the climate warms and glaciers atop Greenland and Antarctica slip off into the seas, and so the total rise by the end of the century will be much above a value based on an extrapolation of the present?   
  
The idea—graphically portrayed in Al Gore’s science fiction film—is that summer meltwater will flow down the, say, 10,000 feet required to get to the bottom of Greenland’s ice, and “lubricate” the flowing glaciers. (Of course, the reason glaciers flow to begin with is because the pressure is so great that the bottom water is liquid, but never mind that fact).   
  
Last time, I noted a recent paper by Faezeh Nick and colleagues that basically pooh-poohed the idea that surface meltwater does this.   
  
_Offing the PIG_   
  
Another oft-repeated threat is that there are a plethora of glaciers in Antarctica that are grounded in the oceans, and that higher water temperatures will lead to melting from below that will ultimately “unground” them, floating them and causing rapid retreat.   
  
Alarmist fingers are most often pointed at Antarctica’s Pine Island Glacier (PIG), the leading candidate to unground and raise sea levels by up to 4.5 feet a relatively short amount of time. It was Terence Hughes (from University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, which—surprise—thrives on climate change) in the early 1980s that labeled the PIG as the “weak underbelly” of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet for, in his view, having the biggest potential to contribute a lot of sea level rise in a short amount of time. Hughes’s belief has become popular of late as the rate of retreat of the PIG increased in the early 1990s.   
  
In 2008, University of Colorado’s Tad Pfeffer and colleagues projected that the PIG (and the nearby Thwaites glacier) would add between 4.3 and 15.4 inches of sea level rise by 2100. In early 2010, the reliably alarmist _New Scientist_ headlined “Major Antarctic Glacier ‘Past its Tipping Point’”, inaccurately quoting Oxford’s Richard Katz who actually said “the take-home message is that we should be concerned about tipping points in West Antarctica and we should do a lot more work to investigate” (translation: can I scare you into sending me more money?).   
  
But throwing cold water in the PIG pen are the prolific polar researcher Ian Joughin and his colleagues. In a new paper published in _Geophysical Research Letters_ , Joughin _et al_. reported their efforts to simulate the future behavior of PIG using a “basinscale glaciological model” that they verified against a large amount of satellite observations documenting the flow rate and thinning rate of the PIG. Once they were happy that their model depicted the observations correctly, they turned to look at what the future may hold in store.   
  
What they found came as a bit of a surprise.   
  
Instead of an accelerating retreat, it seems that the PIG’s still-tiny decline may remain constant. Joughin _et al._ , write:   




PIG’s dramatic retreat and speedup may not indicate a trend of continued acceleration, and speeds may stabilize at their current elevated levels as thinning continues.



This result ties into another investigation of recent PIG behavior that was published this summer. In that one, Jenkins _et al._ concluded that the geometry of the sea floor upon which the PIG rested is what allowed for a rapid retreat when warming first commenced. In other words, the PIG was predisposed to a rapid response— _initially_.   
  
When Joughin _et al_. plug potential future climate change into their glaciological model of PIG, they found that the initial acceleration is not maintained for very long, and instead soon stabilizes. This has large implications. Instead of PIG contributing _many_ inches of sea level this century, they found about a single inch—and that was the worst case. Joughin and colleagues best estimate is something closer to ½ inch.   
  
Joughin _et al._ conclude:   
  
While we have not modeled the other [nearby Antarctic] glaciers, PIG is the most rapidly changing and largest contributor to the current imbalance, indicating future model-derived upper bounds on 21st century sea level for the entire region are likely to fall well below the heuristically derived 11-to-39 cm upper bound [Pfeffer _et al_., 2008].   
  
Hardly catastrophic.   
  
Sooner or later, these facts may penetrate into public consciousness... but until then I hope you’ll continue to consult _The Current Wisdom_.

"When we think of North Korea, we think of a nation determined to be an outsider in the international community. Whether it’s testing nuclear weapons or threatening London hairdressers, the Democratic People’s Republic is never associated with compliance. But there is compelling evidence that the North Korean government is motivated by domestic power games to co-operate globally on climate change.  North Korea has a record of compliance with its obligations as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The obvious question then is why the North Korean government would show such commitment to the international climate change regime, given its belligerent reputation in the strategic realm. The most obvious link is between environmental degradation, the vulnerable agricultural system and the stability of governance in North Korea. The concept of climate change vulnerability is important there.   Climate change impacts – declining availability of food, water and energy, sea level rise, migration, and extreme weather events – pile more stress onto countries already at risk from internal instability and economic weakness.     Like many poor countries, North Korea, where such problems are endemic, is least able to cope with climate change impacts. These weaknesses include food insecurity, energy shortages, economic fragility and a own rigid political system. So North Korea is using the UNFCCC as a vehicle for projects designed to increase agricultural output and build the resilience of the agricultural system to disasters.   The country exists in a state of near-perpetual food insecurity (the FAO estimates a food deficit of 207,000 tonnes in 2012-2013), stemming from a structural food deficit along with an inability and unwillingness to buy food from international markets.  In these circumstances, any disruption to domestic agricultural production will have a significant impact on the food security of at-risk segments of the population, creating ripple effects across the country’s economy and political system.  This illustrates the degree to which food insecurity is an existential problem for the North Korean leadership.   Degradation of the land base is another critical problem requiring technical assistance.  Land degradation in the DPRK is a symptom of ideological rigidity in land management, climatic impacts and the country’s energy shortages, exacerbating food insecurity.   The capacity-building assistance made available via the UNFCCC and related programs boosting planting and harvesting efficiency, building soil fertility and reforestation helps to increase the productive capacity of the agricultural sector and enhance its resilience against climate change. The incentives for participation are not confined to agriculture.  North Korea is using the UNFCCC as a vehicle for obtaining foreign assistance to upgrade its energy production and transmission infrastructure.   North Korea’s energy security problem is well documented, revolving around four distinct challenges: supply, generation, power transmission, and secondary usage.  Of these four challenges, electricity generation and transmission are the two that can be addressed through the UNFCCC.   Renewable energy may be the most appropriate vehicle for increasing generation capacity because unlike large centralised fossil-fuels, renewables can be scaled locally which reduces their up-front cost.   For example, a UNDP-sponsored project is installing small-scale wind energy systems at sites across North and South Pyongan Provinces, helping to alleviate energy shortages affecting these areas by decoupling them from reliance on the coal-generated electricity grid.   Most significantly, renewables offer North Korea considerable scope for technology transfer, infrastructure upgrades and income through the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol.   Technology transfers for such projects do not violate the import restrictions of dual-use technologies listed under the UN Security Council sanctions regime against the DPRK. The income potential derives from the carbon credits generated by North Korea’s renewable projects, which can be traded on international carbon markets.   While there is revenue potential in the generation and sale of carbon credits, the magnitude of the potential revenue is comparatively small.  Together, the  projects already online in North Korea account for 193,475 carbon credits.  At the EU spot price for carbon credits of $US 5.66/ton (4.24 €/ton) as of July 2013, North Korea’s current portfolio of carbon credits are worth a mere $US 1m per year.   North Korea has strong incentives to fight climate change and its potential to erode government control. The fact that the nation has become more compliant over time suggests that the objectives of the international climate change regime coalesce with the survival imperatives of Kim Jong-un’s government.

"The Tesla Model S electric car arrives in the UK this week. On the face of it this appears just another car launch, but is in fact something closer to a revolution.  The Tesla Model S is the first battery-electric luxury car to be sold in Britain, and it succeeds the limited edition Tesla Roadster, an electric sportscar built by British manufacturer Lotus in Norfolk and based on its Elise. The Roadster was the car that put the Tesla brand on the map and concentrated many minds in the more orthodox automotive industry on the rising potential for electric vehicles (EV). Elon Musk, famous for his role developing PayPal and the SpaceX spaceflight company, regards his Tesla cars as the Apple of the automotive sector, arguing that like Apple’s products, the quality and design of Tesla cars allow them to command a premium price. Nevertheless, the £50,000 price tag (after government subsidy) makes it competitive with equivalent luxury cars from BMW or Jaguar. In terms of styling, many feel it is among the best in that segment. The Model S is also the first EV, depending on which battery option is chosen, with a range not unlike cars with conventional internal combustion engines – striking a blow to the “range anxiety” that electric vehicles supposedly cause. Further evidence of Tesla’s roots in Silicon Valley can be seen in the dashboard – a control screen, like a large iPad – and the fact that much of the car’s software can be reconfigured remotely. Where most traditional manufacturers’ cars would require a trip to the dealer for any software updates (if they bother at all), in the case of the Tesla such updates are carried out regularly, overnight, while the car is charging in its garage. Tesla uses online updates to address any software problems and upgrade the car’s intelligent systems. The Model S “operating system” is installed in two hard drives that run in parallel, so that the car can still operate from one even while the other is upgraded. The UK is relatively late to enjoy the Model S, probably due to the need to reconfigure the car for right hand drive. Tesla sold 17,650 cars in the US last year, making it the third best selling electric car after the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt (23,094), and the battery-electric Nissan Leaf (22,610), the latter selling at half the price of the Tesla. This puts it ahead in terms of sales of the plug-in Toyota Prius, and many electric and hybrid cars from more mainstream manufacturers. In fact, the Model S has become a kind of cult car among North American celebrities and other wealthy motorists keen to display their green credentials. In Europe, Tesla is enjoying healthy sales in EV-friendly markets such as Norway, where 20% of all new cars sold in March were electric, and more Teslas were sold than any other car. In the Netherlands some 35,000 EVs are now registered. In terms of total EV sales, including hybrids, the Netherlands was the largest EU market in 2013 with around 25,000 registrations, followed by France with 15,000 and Norway with around 7,000. The UK came in fifth place with around 4,000 – after Germany (with how many?), where high speed Autobahns that sap battery power and loyalty to local manufacturers have kept EV sales down.  Looking at these numbers, it may seem that the Model S will struggle to sell well in Britain. On the other hand, although most EVs sold here so far have been quite utilitarian vehicles used to beat the London congestion charge, with steady sales of the Nissan Leaf, the UK supports a healthy luxury car market. There are no shortage of millionaires and billionaires residing here, so the Model S may find more buyers than for the cheaper models already here. A further boost may come from Tesla’s innovative sales model. The company favours “experience centres” in shopping malls, a style that has fallen foul of car dealer groups in the US and franchise laws in certain states, prompting a series of lawsuits. LINK Due to quite different car distribution regulation, this is easier to implement in Europe, and Tesla centres in the UK are expected in large up-market shopping centres with London, Birmingham and Manchester among the first locations."

LiveScience.com posted an article yesterday where the usual IPCC suspects (Gavin Schmidt, Kevin Trenberth, and Andy Dessler) dissed our recent paper in in the journal Remote Sensing.
Given their comments, I doubt any of them could actually state what the major conclusion of our paper was.
For example, Andy Dessler told LiveScience:

“He’s taken an incorrect model, he’s tweaked it to match observations, but the conclusions you get from that are not correct…” 
Well, apparently Andy did not notice that those were OBSERVATIONS that disagreed with the IPCC climate models. And our model can quantitatively explain the disagreement.
Besides, is Andy implying the IPCC models he is so fond of DON’T have THEIR results tweaked to match the observations? Yeah, right.
Kevin Trenberth’s response to our paper, rather predictably, was:
“I cannot believe it got published”
Which when translated from IPCC-speak actually means, “Why didn’t I get the chance to deep-six Spencer’s paper, just like I’ve done with his other papers?”
Finally Gavin Schmidt claims that it’s the paleoclimate record that tells us how sensitive the climate system is, not the current satellite data. Oh, really? Then why have so many papers been published over the years trying to figure out how sensitive today’s climate system is? When scientists appeal to unfalsifiable theories of ancient events which we have virtually no data on, and ignore many years of detailed global satellite observations of today’s climate system, *I* think they are giving science a bad name.
COMMENTS ON THE FORBES ARTICLE BY JAMES TAYLOR
I have received literally dozens of phone calls and e-mails asking basically the same question: did James Taylor’s Forbes article really represent what we published in our Remote Sensing journal article this week?
Several of those people, including AP science reporter Seth Borenstein, actually read our article and said that there seemed to be a disconnect.
The short answer is that, while the title of the Forbes article (New NASA Data Blow Gaping Hole In Global Warming Alarmism) is a little over the top (as are most mainstream media articles about global warming science), the body of his article is — upon my re-reading of it — actually pretty good.
About the only disconnect I can see is we state in our paper that, while the discrepancy between the satellite observations were in the direction of the models producing too much global warming, it is really not possible to say by how much. Taylor’s article makes it sound much more certain that we have shown that the models produce too much warming in the long term. (Which I think is true…we just did not actually ‘prove’ it.)
But how is this any different than the reporting we see on the other side of the issue? Heck, how different is it than the misrepresentation of the certainty of the science in the IPCC’s own summaries for policymakers, versus what the scientists write in the body of those IPCC reports?
I am quite frankly getting tired of the climate ‘alarmists’ demanding that we ’skeptics’ be held a higher standard than they are held to. They claim our results don’t prove their models are wrong in their predictions of strong future warming, yet fail to mention they have no good, independent evidence their models are right.
For example….
…while our detractors correctly point out that the feedbacks we see in short term (year-to-year) climate variability might not indicate what the long-term feedbacks are in response to increasing CO2, the IPCC still uses short-term variability in their models to compare to satellite observations to then support the claimed realism of the long-term behavior of those models.
Well, they can’t have it both ways.
If they are going to validate their models with short term variability as some sort of indication that their models can be believed for long-term global warming, then they are going to HAVE to explain why there is such a huge discrepancy (see Fig. 3 in our paper) between the models and the satellite observations in what is the most fundamental issue: How fast do the models lose excess radiant energy in response to warming?
That is essentially the definition of “feedback”, and feedbacks determine climate sensitivity.
I’m sorry, but if this is the best they can do in the way of rebuttal to our study, they are going to have to become a little more creative.

I can’t improve on the description offered by Steve McIntyre on the most recent taxpayer funded %&#@^*! from NOAA: their sponsorship of the display Pillars of Climate at the recent American Meteorological Society’s Applied Climatology and Climate Change Adaptation conference in Asheville.
But I second Steve’s call for a Parthenon where mere mortals can pay homage to the demigods of the atmosphere. Here, in this fortress of turpitude, they can ponder the role of clouds:

Behold, the bust of Mann (modeled of course):

Part Two: 



**Inequalities past and present**



We can start with the state of many developed economies. While they continue to grow in overall economic terms (if not as quickly as they once did), **they have too often failed to share the benefits** of that growth.



In many countries, while the very wealthiest have grown consistently wealthier, the rest have seen little or no real rise in their incomes or their living standards – over decades.



Inequalities that deepened with the great deregulating reforms of the 1980s and 90s have become **a permanent feature of these economies** – not a brief moment of pain.



 **That is certainly the case in New Zealand.**



As a small country, we are often at the forefront of global trends, because **we can move faster and sometimes further than our larger counterparts.** That was evident in the way we embraced – and sometimes pioneered – the free-market reforms of the 1980s and 90s.



Starting in 1984, through to the 1990s, we removed regulations that were said to hamper business, slashed subsidies, transformed the tax system, dramatically cut public spending and massively reduced welfare benefits paid to the sick, those caring for children and the unemployed.



Now we can argue whether those regulatory reforms were necessary, but regardless the numbers speak for themselves.



Within 20 years, my country lost its status as **one of the most equal** in the OECD. While incomes at the top doubled and GDP grew steadily, incomes at the bottom stagnated and **child poverty more than doubled.**



I was a child back then, but I remember clearly how society changed. I remember nothing of the Rogernomics of course– I was 5 and I was not the Doogie Howser of politics. But I do remember the human face. Especially the kids who just didn’t have the basics.



This experience is not New Zealand’s alone. It happened in many countries, often with deeper inequalities and more persistently stagnant real wages.



And the change hasn’t always been reversed yet. In fact, more recent trends have added new dimensions to the problem.



The financial crisis of a decade ago did not turn into another Great Depression, thankfully – but it has led to ongoing upheaval in the **global political economy.**



High debt and prolonged low interest rates have **inflated asset values,** widening inequalities in new ways. Most obviously for countries like New Zealand and Australia, **booming housing markets have put home ownership out of reach of a growing number of younger people** , especially when coupled with the debt many accumulate trying to further their education.



That same generation that is facing the prospect **of new challenges – climate change and digital transformation putting people out of work now and into the future.**



And just to add fuel to that already grim picture, **new forms of media and communication are changing how we understand what is happening in our societies – and how we connect with each other.** This change has opened up the world, in one sense – but it has also had the opposite effect of making us more distant, at times more entrenched. Stunningly, our most connected generation in New Zealand, has also been found to be our loneliest.



In the face of this fragmentation and disillusion, what does good government look like, not for us but for the very people who are turning away from us?



 **Two paths**



I’ve already mentioned one potential answer to this question.



In recent years, we have seen politicians and governments of all stripes respond to the stresses and challenges I have outlined by turning inwards.



Domestically, some have chosen to **reject** the independent and **expert public service** and the possibility of a mutually respectful and **diverse nation.**



Abroad, they **reject the international institutions** that they paint as responsible for both economic and cultural problems when they aren’t necessarily at fault.



So this is one answer that is available to people – and that some are signing up for. After all, **fear and blame is an easy political out.**



As I say, I understand how we got to this point. But I reject this answer.



Because there is another response. Instead of turning inwards, we can improve the institutions that have helped hold together this long period of **global peace** that we live in.



 **Instead of austerity measures** that only stretch the rich-poor divide, we can offer meaningful support – and more than just financially – to those at the bottom.



Instead of tearing down what works about our societies, we can build the system back up. We can acknowledge the areas where public policy hasn’t met the challenges of economic change, and do better.



One of the ways we can do this is by **widening our idea of what prosperity means.** Because if a country has been growing economically for 30 years, yet large numbers of its citizens haven’t felt the benefit, is it really moving forward?



If a country has a relatively high rate of GDP growth, but it is neglecting the things that we should all hold dear – like the health of our children, a warm, dry home for all, mental health services or rivers and lakes that we can swim in – then can it be said to be improving?

I was over at Judy Curry’s place, reading her update to the Mail on Sunday story, and noticed she referenced URLs to the updated FAQs at the BEST website. I followed and was totally shocked to read this FAQ: (bold mine)
Why didn’t Berkeley Earth wait for peer review?

Some people think that peer review consists of submitting a paper to a journal and waiting for the anonymous comments of referees. Traditional peer review is much broader than that and much more open. In science, when you have a new result, your first step is to present it to your colleagues by giving presentations, talks at local and international conferences, colloquia, and by sending out “preprints.” In fact, every academic department in the sciences had a preprint library where people would read up on the latest results. If they found something to disagree with, they would talk to or write the authors. Preprint libraries were so popular that, if you found someone was not in the office or lab, the first place you would search would be in the preprint library. Recently these rooms have disappeared, their place taken over by the internet. The biggest preprint library in the world now is a website, arXiv.org.
Such traditional and open peer review has many advantages. It usually results in better papers in the archival journals, because the papers are widely examined prior to publication. It does have a disadvantage, however, that journalists can also pick up preprints and report on them before the traditional peer-review process is finished.
Perhaps because of the media picking up on talks and preprints, a few journals made a new rule: they will not publish anything that is distributed as a preprint or that is discussed openly in a meeting or colloquium. This policy has resulted in more attention to several journals, but the restrictive approach had a detrimental effect on the traditional peer review system. Some fields of science, for example String Theory, objected so strongly that they refuse to publish in these journals, and they put all their papers online immediately.
The best alternative would be to have the media hold back and not report preprint material. Unfortunately they refuse to do that. The situation is made more difficult by the fact that many of the media misreport the content of the preprints. For that reason Berkeley Earth has tried to answer the questions given to us by the media, in hopes that our work will be more accurately reported. The two page summary of findings is also meant to help ensure that the media reports accurately reflect the content of our papers.
==============================================================
I call absolute total BS on that. Why?
Because BEST contacted media in advance of the release of their papers and provided preprints. The October 20th release by BEST was planned and coordinated with media, such as the Economist, Guardian, NYT, New Scientist, and Nature, all of which contacted me before the release on October 20th. This FAQ on peer review was added sometime after that date, I don’t know when, but the FAQ headline obviously refers to past tense.
Remember the ethical quandary I wrote about on October 15th? I wrote then:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Imagine, if you will, that you are given a complete draft copy of a new paper that has just been submitted to a journal, and that paper cites your work, and it was provided as a professional courtesy before it has been peer-reviewed and accepted.
There’s a caveat attached to the email with the paper which says:
“Please keep it confidential until we post it ourselves.”
OK, fine and dandy, no problem there. Happy to oblige. I sent along a couple of small corrections and thanked the author.
Imagine my surprise when I get this email Friday from a reporter at a major global media outlet. I’ve redacted the names.
Dear Mr Watts
I’m the [media name redacted] new environment editor. I’m planning to write a pretty big piece next week on the [paper preprint name redacted], and wondered whether you might be able to give me your view of it. I think you’ve been sent the  [paper preprint name redacted] paper… If you did happen to be able and interested, I’d be enormously grateful for a word about this on Monday. Might that be possible?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I objected to being put in an untenable position with confidentiality on the paper. I was asked for my confidentiality about one of the papers, but then they gave the paper to media, and the media came calling me asking me to comment on it. I had no warning they would do so.
The Economist was first and that’s the email from reporter James Astill above, and I had to ask permission from Dr. Richard Muller before I spoke with Astill, as I mentioned in my report on October 20th.
Elizabeth Muller told me herself that “this is coordinated for October 20th”. Dr. Richard Muller says he sent it to one outlet, but I got requests from other media outlets before October 20th release. How did that happen?
—–Original Message—–
From: Richard A Muller
Date: Friday, October 14, 2011 3:35 PM
To: Anthony Watts- ItWorks
Subject: Re: Our paper is attached
Anthony,
We sent a copy to only one media person, from The Economist, whom we trust to keep it confidential.  I sent a copy to you because I knew you would also keep it confidential.
I apologize for not having gotten back to you about your comments.  I particularly like your suggestion about the title; that is an improvement.
Rich
I have all my notes and emails from these exchange with BEST and media outlets who made request, so this isn’t a matter of recollection.
For example this from the WUWT contact form:

[Watts Up With That?] Contact
Subject    interview query from Nature magazine
2011-10-18 @ 12:05:13 PM
Hello Mr. Watts, I’m preparing a story about the formal release of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature analysis on Thursday, and I was hoping to get your thoughts. Their embargoed release says they specifically looked at the temperature stations you flagged as suspect (as well as the urban heat island effect), and they say the trends hold true. Of course they already reported much of this unofficially back in May, but there you go. Would you have a moment to chat? My number is 212-451-xxxx. If I don’t hear back, I’ll see if I can’t track down your address through other means. Best, Jeff Tollefson US Correspondent Nature magazine
I wrote October 20th when the media blitz happened:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Readers may recall this post last week where I complained about being put in a uncomfortable quandary by an author of a new paper. Despite that, I chose to honor the confidentiality request of the author Dr. Richard Muller, even though I knew that behind the scenes, they were planning a media blitz to MSM outlets. In the past few days I have been contacted by James Astill of the Economist, Ian Sample of the Guardian, and Leslie Kaufman of the New York Times. They have all contacted me regarding the release of papers from BEST today.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now BEST is telling us it is the media who refuses to hold back on reporting preprints? Give me a freaking break.
Either the Muller team is grossly incompetent at public relations, or they are playing a unbelievably stupid game of CYA after the fact due to the negative reactions they are getting to the “press before peer review” fiasco they brought on themselves.
Either way, it’s gobsmackingly unscrupulous of them to now blame the media.

"While city planners have been encouraged to plant trees and gardens to green the city for the health of its inhabitants, recent research has found that the same trees can damage certain buildings. Our research revealed that chemicals produced by certain species of plants and trees react with common air pollutants to create damaging chemicals that corrode building materials such as stone, concrete, and steel. Especially at risk are heritage buildings which are built of limestone or sandstone. Published in the Science of the Total Environment journal, our study examined the role of “green infrastructure” such as trees and vegetation in towns and cities, something that local authorities have been encouraged to invest in. Urban green areas can reduce greenhouse gases, cut down exposure to pollution for city dwellers, especially those spending time in heavily polluted areas such as cyclists, and provide a mental health boost. Interactions between the chemicals released by plants and building materials have not been studied, so we made our focus. The damage is caused by ground level ozone, formed when the volatile organic compounds given off into the air by plants are broken down in sunlight and react with the common pollutant nitrogen dioxide. Using mathematical simulations, we investigated the effect of green vegetation on the integrity of limestone and steel structures during different seasons. Some species commonly found in cities such as sycamore maple and Douglas fir produce these organic compounds. Urban areas with many of these and similarly active species will therefore have higher concentrations of ground level ozone during summers, and so a relatively larger rate of lime stone deterioration.  The effect of green infrastructure on building materials is not always identical. Each building material has differing resistance or vulnerability to a particular pollutant. For example, limestone, from which buildings such as Houses of Parliament or St Paul’s Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey are constructed, is strongly damaged by increased levels of ground level ozone. Other building materials such as zinc, copper and carbon steel are also affected, both by the levels of air pollutants and the local climatic conditions. Some of the corrosive gases, such as sulphur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides, are particularly aggressive in attacking building materials.  Sulphur dioxide, the active ingredient in acid rain, is no longer a major issue in most of the developed world. But this is only after decades of efforts to reduce sulphur emissions from power stations and factories, and move to low-sulphur fuels. Ozone and nitrogen oxides still remain a challenge. Ground level ozone in the northern hemisphere has almost doubled since the 19th century, with up to two-thirds of these emissions due to burning fossil fuels. In Asia and Latin America nitrogen oxides are increasing due to less stringent environmental regulations. Here, transport emissions account for a large proportion of nitrogen oxides which then contribute to ozone formation.  In contrast, in Europe levels of roadside nitrogen oxides have significantly decreased due to tighter regulations and improving vehicle technology. Even so, the rate of decrease is slower than anticipated. There has been no similar decrease in nitrogen dioxide levels, despite reductions in nitrogen oxides. Consequently high levels of nitrogen dioxide that breach EU limits are found in many urban areas throughout Europe, with serious implications for building integrity, and for public health. Nitrogen dioxide has been linked to adverse respiratory effects, especially in people with asthma. To date, only the positive effects of “greening” the city have been considered, without realising that the vegetation planted could in fact be adding to the problem. The effects that more plants and trees can have on relative humidity and wind in a local area can also act as a catalyst for further deterioration of buildings. Planners may want to realise that planting trees for the benefit of people can have unintended consequences on bridges, buildings and other key infrastructure. But green areas are important, integral parts of towns and cities – it will not do to simply cut them out of the equation. Instead those designing city parks and gardens and other greening improvements should carefully select the species that will produce the least organic compounds, and so limit the damage to buildings around them."
"It was bats. Or pangolins. To hear common narratives about the origins of Covid-19, there is a simple causal relationship between China’s consumption of wild animals and the coronavirus ravaging the globe. Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States’ top epidemiologist, told Fox: “It boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we don’t just shut it down.” His opinion echoes a growing chorus across the political spectrum that singles out China’s so-called “wet markets” as the culprit for the pandemic. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has called the Chinese exotic animal trade “disgusting” and conservationist Jane Goodall has called for “a global ban”.  Science and political economy, however, tell a more complex story. The principal driver of zoonotic diseases (such as the virus Sars-Cov-2, which spread from animals to humans) is industrial animal agriculture. When food production encroaches on wild habitats, it creates opportunities for pathogens to jump to livestock and humans. Industrial agriculture also breeds its own diseases, like swine flu and avian flu, on hellish factory farms. And it contributes to antibiotic resistance and climate change, both of which exacerbate the problem. We need to have an honest public discussion on how to produce our food. Individually, we must stop eating animal products. Collectively, we must transform the global food system and work toward ending animal agriculture and rewilding much of the world. Oddly, many people who would never challenge the reality of climate change refuse to acknowledge the role meat-eating plays in endangering public health. Eating meat, it seems, is a socially acceptable form of science denial. Researchers have long issued warnings about the consequences of our livestock-dominated food system. After the Sars outbreak in 2003, an essay in the American Journal of Public Health lamented that “changing the way humans treat animals – most basically, ceasing to eat them or, at the very least, radically limiting the quantity of them that are eaten – is largely off the radar as a significant preventive measure.” In 2016, the UN Environment Program warned that the “livestock revolution” was a zoonotic disaster waiting to happen. Yet meat consumption continues to rise. Now, just as experts predicted, eating animals is coming back to bite us. Xenophobes call Covid-19 the “Wuhan virus”, but in reality zoonoses emerge worldwide, and do so with increasing regularity. The 1918 “Spanish flu” probably came from a midwestern pig farm. In the 1990s, ecological destabilization in the US south-west led to the Four Corners hantavirus outbreak. The Hendra and Menangle viruses are named after Australian towns. The Reston virus is an Ebola strain named after a DC suburb. Marburg virus emerged in Germany. These last two diseases sprang from monkeys imported for laboratory use – the Chinese are not the only ones with a large and dangerous wildlife trade. Sars, Mers and Zika are only three of many novel zoonoses to strike in the new millennium. Fauci, Graham and Goodall’s call for a clampdown on the “exotic” animal trade is a valid demand, but ignores how that industry is inextricably intertwined with “conventional” food production. The Chinese government has encouraged smallholders to breed and procure wild game to compensate for losing market-share to large livestock firms. Similarly, reliance on “bush meat” in west Africa increased after local fishers were pushed out of coastal waters by foreign trawlers in the 1970s, leading to the outbreaks of HIV and Ebola. The problem isn’t some people’s taste for seemingly strange delicacies, but rather our global, profit-driven, meat-centered food system. Just as zoonotic threats are multiplying, combating them is becoming harder. Antibiotics are increasingly ineffective in part because commercial livestock farmers abuse them, hoping to speed up growth rates or as a prophylactic measure against the spread of disease on overcrowded factory farms. Overuse of antibiotics spurs the evolution of “super-bugs” like MRSA, a flesh-eating bacterium now found at hospitals worldwide. Modern solutions, like viral cures and vaccines, are elusive. The World Health Organization reported that the most important techniques for controlling the 2003 Sars outbreak were not cutting-edge medicines so much as “19th-century public health strategies of contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation”. This has also been the case with Covid-19. Our short-term priority is the development of a vaccine for Covid-19. But we must also start thinking about more radical measures to address the roots of this crisis. We need a more resilient food system that puts less stress on the planet and on public health. This requires three interventions. The first is ending subsidies to industrial animal agriculture and taxing animal products to incorporate the cost of environmental and public health externalities, with the aim of the industry’s eventual abolition. The second is support for local, sustainable plant farming to replace the monocrop-focused status quo. We must relieve pressure on soil and wildlife while creating better, safer agricultural jobs. (We should also remember that meatpacking workers, like their peers in wet markets, tend to be the first exposed to new pathogens.) The third is large-scale, public-directed investment in both plant-based meat alternatives and cellular agriculture (ie, growing animal tissue from stem cells), which would expand scientific research and employment while spurring a transition to animal-free protein. The post-meat age will be a healthier one. Between farming, ranching and feed crops, the livestock industry gobbles up 40% of the world’s habitable surface. A vegan food system would require a tenth as much land. Restoring the natural environment could also create jobs through a public works program akin to the New Deal’s Civilian Conservation Corps. And it would reduce the outbreak of new epidemics by reducing contact between humans and wild animals and by restoring biodiversity. Old habits can change. In the last few weeks, as the coronavirus has spread and millions shelter in place, bean sales have surged. People, it seems, are willing to eat legumes if it’s part of a public health effort. When this pandemic ends they’ll need to keep doing just that, lest a more lethal disaster comes to pass.

"**When Paula-Jayne Tate won a competition for her family to visit Santa Claus in a County Donegal village, she screamed with joy.**
The mother-of-four was particularly delighted for her five-year-old daughter, Kaidence, who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, a condition that causes a build-up of fluid in the brain.
She said meeting Father Christmas would have been a ""magical"" end to a terrible year for Kaidence, who is recovering from multiple brain surgeries.
But their visit has been cancelled due to the two-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measures introduced on Friday.
The Tates, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, are among many families across Northern Ireland who have had to rethink their annual visits to visit Santa this Christmas due to the pandemic.
Kaidence, who has been shielding with her family since March, also missed last year's festivities due to illness, her mother said.
""It has been a very difficult year and planning to see Santa meant the world to us,"" said Paula-Jayne.
""We have not had any celebrations at all this year - no birthday, Easter or Halloween parties - so seeing Santa would have been magical.
""The timing was also good because Kaidence is doing so well at the moment.
""It would have been the perfect end to a terrible year with the hope that 2021 will bring more positivity.""
Paula-Jayne said the family hoped to organise a telephone call from Santa in place of their usual visit to the grotto.
Pat Doherty, from Donegal's Lapland in Ballyliffin, said it was difficult to let families like the Tates down.
In the past, he said they had catered for up to 17,000 visitors, but had only accepted 3,000 bookings this year due to Covid-19.
""Our bookings start to come in in August and by September this year we stopped taking new bookings because of the way things were going [with the virus] in Donegal,"" he said.
November bookings had been cancelled due to restrictions in the Republic of Ireland, while Stormont's restrictions have hit December bookings as most visitors to Ballyliffin Lapland travel from Northern Ireland, said Mr Doherty.
""We spent a month building and planning the village, and we were ready to go.
""We are waiting to see what happens next. There is nothing else we can do.""
Claudine Owens, who has five children, had been looking forward to meeting Santa in a rural cottage which has also been shut down.
Mrs Owens, from Seaforde, County Down, is disappointed they will have to forego many of their family traditions this year.
""I felt like it would be something normal and exciting after a hard year,"" she said.
""Visits to Santa are special. I keep all the photographs of our visits every year in a box, so it is sad.
""But it has also made me realise how fortunate we have been in other years to do all the lovely things we do before Christmas.""
Hugh Black, manager of the Tower Centre, Ballymena, said the shopping centre's Santa grotto had not been able to open yet due to restrictions on indoor visitor attractions.
""We had 5,500 children through the grotto last year,"" he said. ""That is how many disappointed families we will have if it can't go ahead at all.
""It is a huge deal.""
Mr Black remained optimistic the centre would be able to open the grotto if restrictions on non-essential services are lifted as planned on 11 December.
In the meantime, Father Christmas is reading children's stories in weekly videos posted on the centre's social media platforms, which Mr Black said gave children ""a chance to see Santa in their homes"".
Garden centre owner Robin Mercer said he was disappointed to cancel the visits of hundreds of families who had booked appointments with Santa during this two-week circuit breaker.
Hillmount Garden Centre's grotto had been adapted to enable social distancing, including larger rooms, a booking system and temperature testing, said Mr Mercer.
""It is a big responsibility to host Santa, we feel like we are letting families down, even if it is out of our control,"" he said.
""It's not just for ourselves, it's for all the other places that do Santa's grottos.""
Mr Mercer said he remained hopeful there would be some easing of restrictions after the circuit-breaker, allowing at least some hopeful children to get their wish of seeing Santa this year.
However, one thing is for certain, some children may not be able to visit Santa this year, but he will still be leaving presents under the tree on 25 December."

Regular readers may recall that back on June 15th, I pointed out the absurdity of this “Row to the Pole” publicity stunt sponsored by the whisky company “Old Pulteney” which had plans to row to the North Magnetic Pole (based on the 1996 location) and along the way take some temperature, water, and ice samples along the way in the guise of a science expedition.

Only problem was, the North Magnetic Pole is far into the Arctic sea now, and ice locked. The destination they chose for “Row to the Pole” hasn’t been the location of the North Magnetic Pole for 15 years, as I illustrated below, they’ll fall about 738 km/458 miles short of the North Magnetic Pole due to a drift of about 41km/year:

Undeterred by this complication, the group of rowers has set off anyway, and made some good progress according to their Facebook page, covering 40 kilometers on the first day. They even offer a satellite tracking page to watch the progress.
Too bad though they have not checked the latest satellite images from NASA’s AQUA Modis RAPIDFIRE page. I did, and it looks like the expedition is going to hit a wall of ice soon.
Here’s the area I chose to look at today from this NASA image link=>
I rotated/cropped, plotted the approximate proposed path, and annotated the image from NASA to help readers see what the Row to the Pole people are soon going to run into in a couple of days:


Note the patch of white in the red box that the planned rowing path transects. Are those clouds or ice? The magnified view area gives the answer below.

Yup, unless those guys in the rowboat have an icebreaker leading the way, or there’s an “instamelt” de-icing ahead of them, they likely aren’t going anywhere near the old North Magnetic Pole circa 1996, much less the actual one.
Looks like “Scotch on the Rocks” for them.
However, like any good publicity stunt, they’ll probably figure out some way to make a success out of it, perhaps declaring that “important though incomplete science has been done”.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Loehle and Scafetta recently posted a piece on decomposing the HadCRUT3 temperature record into a couple of component cycles plus a trend. I disagreed with their analysis on a variety of grounds. In the process, I was reminded of work I had done a few years ago using what is called “Periodicity Analysis” (PDF).
A couple of centuries ago, a gentleman named Fourier showed that any signal could be uniquely decomposed into a number of sine waves with different periods. Fourier analysis has been a mainstay analytical tool since that time. It allows us to detect any underlying regular sinusoidal cycles in a chaotic signal.
Figure 1. Joseph Fourier, looking like the world’s happiest mathematician
While Fourier analysis is very useful, it has a few shortcomings. First, it can only extract sinusoidal signals. Second, although it has good resolution as short timescales, it has poor resolution at the longer timescales. For many kinds of cyclical analysis, I prefer periodicity analysis.
So how does periodicity analysis work? The citation above gives a very technical description of the process, and it’s where I learned how to do periodicity analysis. Let me attempt to give a simpler description, although I recommend the citation for mathematicians.

Periodicity analysis breaks down a signal into cycles, but not sinusoidal cycles. It does so by directly averaging the data itself, so that it shows the actual cycles rather than theoretical cycles.
For example, suppose that we want to find the actual cycle of length two in a given dataset. We can do it by numbering the data points in order, and then dividing them into odd- and even-numbered data points. If we average all of the odd data points, and we average all of the even data, it will give us the average cycle of length two in the data. Here is what we get when we apply that procedure to the HadCRUT3 dataset:
Figure 2. Periodicity in the HadCRUT3 global surface temperature dataset, with a cycle length of 2. The cycle has been extended to be as long as the original dataset.
As you might imagine for a cycle of length 2, it is a simple zigzag. The amplitude is quite small, only plus/minus a hundredth of a degree. So we can conclude that there is only a tiny cycle of length two in the HadCRUT3.
Next, here is the same analysis, but with a cycle length of four. To do the analysis, we number the dataset in order with a cycle of four, i.e. “1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4 …”
Then we average all the “ones” together, and all of the twos and the threes and the fours. When we plot these out, we see the following pattern:
Figure 3. Periodicity in the HadCRUT3 global surface temperature dataset, with a cycle length of 4. The cycle has been extended to be as long as the original dataset.
As I mentioned above, we are not reducing the dataset to sinusoidal (sine wave shaped) cycles. Instead, we are determining the actual cycles in the dataset. This becomes more evident when we look at say the twenty year cycle:
Figure 4. Periodicity in the HadCRUT3 dataset, with a cycle length of 20. The cycle has been extended to be as long as the original dataset.
Note that the actual 20 year cycle is not sinusoidal. Instead, it rises quite sharply, and then decays slowly.
Now, as you can see from the three examples above, the amplitudes of the various length cycles are quite different. If we set the mean (average) of the original data to zero, we can measure the power in the cyclical underlying signals as the sum of the absolute values of the signal data. It is useful to compare this power value to the total power in the original signal. If we do this at all possible frequencies, we get a graph of the strength of each of the underlying cycles.
For example, suppose we are looking at a simple sine wave with a period of 24 years. Figure 5 shows the sine wave, along with periodicity analysis in blue showing the power in each of the various length cycles:
Figure 5. A sine wave, along with the periodicity analysis of all cycles up to half the length of the dataset.
Looking at Figure 5, we can see one clear difference between Fourier analysis and periodicity analysis — the periodicity analysis shows peaks at 24, 48, and 72 years, while a Fourier analysis of the same data would only show the 24-year cycle. Of course, the apparent 48 and 72 year peaks are merely a result of the 24 year cycle. Note also that the shortest length peak (24 years) is sharper than the longest length (72-year) peak. This is because there are fewer data points to measure and average when we are dealing with longer time spans, so the sharp peaks tend to broaden with increasing cycle length.
To move to a more interesting example relevant to the Loehle/Scafetta paper, consider the barycentric cycle of the sun. The sun rotates around the center of mass of the solar system. As it rotates, it speeds up and slows down because of the varying pull of the planets. What are the underlying cycles?
We can use periodicity analysis to find the cycles that have the most effect on the barycentric velocity. Figure 6 shows the process, step by step:
Figure 6. Periodicity analysis of the annual barycentric velocity data. 
The top row shows the barycentric data on the left, along with the amount of power in cycles of various lengths on the right in blue. The periodicity diagram at the top right shows that the overwhelming majority of the power in the barycentric data comes from a ~20 year cycle. It also demonstrates what we saw above, the spreading of the peaks of the signal at longer time periods because of the decreasing amount of data.
The second row left panel shows the signal that is left once we subtract out the 20-year cycle from the barycentric data. The periodicity diagram on the second row right shows that after we remove the 20-year cycle, the maximum amount of power is in the 83 year cycle. So as before, we remove that 83-year cycle.
Once that is done, the third row right panel shows that there is a clear 19-year cycle (visible as peaks at 19, 38, 57, and 76 years. This cycle may be a result of the fact that the “20-year cycle” is actually slightly less than 20 years). When that 19-year cycle is removed, there is a 13-year cycle visible at 13, 26, 39 years etc. And once that 13-year cycle is removed … well, there’s not much left at all.
The bottom left panel shows the original barycentric data in black, and the reconstruction made by adding just these four cycles of different lengths is shown in blue. As you can see, these four cycles are sufficient to reconstruct the barycentric data quite closely. This shows that we’ve done a valid deconstruction of the original data.
Now, what does all of this have to do with the Loehle/Scafetta paper? Well, two things. First, in the discussion on that thread I had said that I thought that the 60 year cycle that Loehle/Scafetta said was in the barycentric data was very weak. As the analysis above shows, the barycentric data does not have any kind of strong 60-year underlying cycle. Loehle/Scafetta claimed that there were ~ 20-year and ~ 60-year cycles in both the solar barycentric data and the surface temperature data. I find no such 60-year cycle in the barycentric data.
However, that’s not what I set out to investigate. I started all of this because I thought that the analysis of random red-noise datasets might show spurious cycles. So I made up some random red-noise datasets the same length as the HadCRUT3 annual temperature records (158 years), and I checked to see if they contained what look like cycles.
A “red-noise” dataset is one which is “auto-correlated”. In a temperature dataset, auto-correlated means that todays temperature depends in part on yesterday’s temperature. One kind of red-noise data is created by what are called “ARMA” processes. “AR” stands for “auto-regressive”, and “MA” stands for “moving average”. This kind of random noise is very similar observational datasets such as the HadCRUT3 dataset.
So, I made up a couple dozen random ARMA “pseudo-temperature” datasets using the AR and MA values calculated from the HadCRUT3 dataset, and I ran a periodicity analysis on each of the pseudo-temperature datasets to see what kinds of cycles they contained. Figure 6 shows eight of the two dozen random pseudo-temperature datasets in black, along with the corresponding periodicity analysis of the power in various cycles in blue to the right of the graph of the dataset:
Figure 6. Pseudo-temperature datasets (black lines) and their associated periodicity (blue circles). All pseudo-temperature datasets have been detrended.
Note that all of these pseudo-temperature datasets have some kind of apparent underlying cycles, as shown by the peaks in the periodicity analyses in blue on the right. But because they are purely random data, these are only pseudo-cycles, not real underlying cycles. Despite being clearly visible in the data and in the periodicity analyses, the cycles are an artifact of the auto-correlation of the datasets.
So for example random set 1 shows a strong cycle of about 42 years. Random set 6 shows two strong cycles, of about 38 and 65 years. Random set 17 shows a strong ~ 45-year cycle, and a weaker cycle around 20 years or so. We see this same pattern in all eight of the pseudo-temperature datasets, with random set 20 having cycles at 22 and 44 years, and random set 21 having a 60-year cycle and weak smaller cycles.
That is the main problem with the Loehle/Scafetta paper. While they do in fact find cycles in the HadCRUT3 data, the cycles are neither stronger nor more apparent than the cycles in the random datasets above. In other words, there is no indication at all that the HadCRUT3 dataset has any kind of significant multi-decadal cycles.
How do I know that?
Well, one of the datasets shown in Figure 6 above is actually not a random dataset. It is the HadCRUT3 surface temperature dataset itself … and it is indistinguishable from the truly random datasets in terms of its underlying cycles. All of them have visible cycles, it’s true, in some cases strong cycles … but they don’t mean anything.

APPENDIX:
I did the work in the R computer language. Here’s the code, giving the “periods” function which does the periodicity function calculations. I’m not that fluent in R, it’s about the eighth computer language I’ve learned, so it might be kinda klutzy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEvery good manager knows that economic success and environmental protection only get achieved when resources are used efficiently and wisely. It makes little sense to buy a huge machine that can run only 20% of the time when you can get the job done using a much smaller machine that runs 100% all the time.

Capacity utilization (economic efficiency) of the energy feed-in power production systems in percent. Data source: http://goo.gl/GqJuy. Chart source: Wilfried Heck/. 
Biomasse – biomass
 Wasserkraft – hydro
 EEG-Erzeugung – all combined
 biogener Abfall – bio-waste
 Windkraft – wind power
As the graphic above from Winfried Heck’s website shows, Germany’s overall green power efficiency, depicted by the bold “EEG-Erzeugung” curve, is approaching only 20%.
In the early 90s, biomass and hydro were the bulk of Germany’s renewable energy, and so the overall capacity utilization of its green energy back then was close to 50%. But massive subsidies lead to the large-scale installation of the far less efficient wind power and photovoltaic systems, which today are Germany’s main producers of green energy, overshadowing hydro and biomass. Thus inefficient solar and wind have since dragged the overall efficiency of Germany’s green energy supply down to just over 20%.

That’s horrendous from a technical and economic point of view. At that level, it’s only a question of a very short time before you find your competitors running circles around you.
Note in the chart that photovoltaic systems barely reach 10% of their capacity, wind barely reaches 20%. No wonder electric bills in Germany have been skyrocketing and companies are saying “auf Wiedersehen”.
Although the amount of green energy produced in Germany has gone up, it has become very inefficient overall.
Worse, the more wind and solar systems get installed, the more intermitently the conventional systems end up running, thus making them far less efficient and costlier. Result: Germany’s entire energy production system is rapidly becoming sub-par. That’s bad for the environment, the consumer’s pocket book, and for the country’s global competitiveness.
Call it communist power management. In the communist days it took 10 men to the job of one man in a free market. On the energy market, it takes 5 green generators to do the job of a single conventional generator.
Little wonder that Environment Minister Peter Altmaier says Germany’s transition to green energy is going to cost $1.3 TRILLION dollars if the madness isn’t stopped soon.

There have been some interesting writings coming out of AEI’s new Center for Defense Studies recently. On Friday, Daniel Blumenthal offered some thoughts on China. In the course of making the case that Chinese leaders should realize that we are not trying to contain China, he wrote the following: 





If countries acted in accordance with rational actor theories of political science, the Chinese would be pretty well assured that we are not going to contain it. We have made clear across administrations that we welcome China’s rise as a great power and urge it to act as a responsible one.   
  
  
But countries do not act in accordance with political science theories.



Later in the piece, he wrote the following: 



China is not the only country that is rising. So is India. But we do not worry about India’s rise. That is because India is a democracy. Almost everything it does is transparent to us. We share liberal values with India, including the desire to strengthen the post‐​World War II liberal international order of open trade and investment and the general desire among democracies to settle internal and external disputes peacefully and democratically. The fact that China is not a democracy matters greatly as it rises. It makes its rise more disruptive as countries have to divine its intentions and observe the gap between its rhetorical policy of a “Peaceful Rise” and some of its actions that are inconsistent with a peaceful rise.



He closed thusly: 



Wouldn’t it be nice if China got on board with all the post‐​modern, feel‐​good notions about international politics put forth by the Obama Administration? In the 21st century, says the Obama team, all countries have common interests in confronting transnational issues like climate change and proliferation. Sorry guys, those who lead China think 21st century international politics will look more or less like it did in the past. They favor good old fashioned power politics. Unfortunately for Obama, that forces us to do the same.



There’s an awful lot of interesting stuff going on here. First, Blumenthal’s claim that “countries do not act in accordance with political science theories” is strangely incoherent. As his second and third quotes above make clear, Blumenthal has a political science theory–two actually.   




With respect to India, the theory he is expounding is called “liberalism” in IR jargon. This theory places the causes of war at the so‐​called “second image” level: wars occur because some states are bad and their badness causes them to do bad things. India being a good (democratic) state means we should be friends with it. (There is another variant of liberalism that centers on international institutions, which is mostly but sometimes not bound up with the democracy‐​focused version.)   
  
  
In the latter paragraph about China, Blumenthal looks like he’s dropped liberalism and glommed onto traditional balance‐​of‐​power realism: that is, as a state’s power grows it wants more influence at the international level; positions in the balance of power change in a zero‐​sum fashion; as China grows richer it will seek a larger security role and we will not want to afford it such a role. “Good old fashioned power politics,” as Blumenthal calls it.   
  
  
What’s most curious is Blumenthal’s seeming desire to dismiss _the very idea of political science theories_. My colleague Ben Friedman has dealt with this concept before, noting 



efforts to weigh the costs of war inevitably involve theories of how the world works. As my Professor Steve Van Evera likes to point out, foreign policy makers can use good or bad theories to guide their actions, but if they attempt the slightest foresight, they cannot have none. In other words, there is no such thing as foreign policy without foreign policy theory.



That is, without a theory about how the world works, we would be simply paralyzed by the prospect of issuing advice on foreign policy.   
  
  
Today, Gary Schmitt at AEI wrote the following in criticizing Andrew Bacevich: 



the real, underlying point of not only this particular piece but his views more generally is one connected to his own particular brand of conservative Catholicism. For Bacevich, the U.S. is too secular, too trade happy, too materialist. (”The exploitation of women” referred in his article is not, as presumably the _Post_ editors thought, about “equal pay for equal work” but more likely about the sexual objectification of women.) You see, America is really a nation of imperfect men, marked by original sin, who have no right to take the lead globally. Our real concern should be with our own failings‐​not American preeminence.   
  
  
Taking his lead from Reinhold Niebuhr, Bacevich believes we are on an utopian mission to remake the world–or, in this instance, the Muslim world; it is a program that is immoral both because it is impossible (and hence counterproductive) given human nature and because, in pursuing it, we adopt policies that chip away at our own morality. (The ends begin to justify the means, etc, etc.) The more limited our ambitions in Bacevich’s view, the less damage we do to ourselves and others.   
  
  
All of which contains a kernel of truth–but only a kernel. _Whatever problems we face domestically, it is just an historical fact that a broader American vision abroad has typically made us a better people at home. Nor is there any evidence that a less expansive (and hence less expensive) foreign and defense policy would free up monies that miraculously would solve a problem like poverty or second‐​rate schools. To the contrary, more government funds could well confound finding the policies that would actually help alleviate those problems._ However, the larger point is that Bacevich and other conservative critics, like George Will, are standing on unsound ground when they argue that the transformative goal of the Long War is utopian. It might be long and it might be difficult but, if anything, the evidence so far suggests that the establishment of decent democratic regimes is possible in all kinds of regions and in countries with diverse cultural histories. That hardly means that failure in the Long War isn’t possible; but to hear Bacevich and others tell it, is inevitable. (emphasis mine)



The italicized portion above is just bizarre. In Schmitt’s reading, spending tax dollars on welfare or education “could well confound finding the policies that would actually help alleviate those problems.” This is a fairly straightforward conservative argument. What’s strange is that Schmitt makes the argument that _while the U.S. government likely could not figure out how to improve education or the general welfare in the United States, it can parachute into faraway countries and improve the governance over there. Or it at least ought to try, since “a broader American vision abroad has typically made us a better people at home.”_ This is, to my mind, utterly, profoundly incoherent. I think the most important point is that we ought not to send our military overseas to kill and die so that we can be “a better people at home.” But I wonder how Schmitt’s view fits into the argument made by Brian Schmidt and Michael Williams in this article. For Schmidt and Williams, neoconservative views on foreign policy are merely an extension of their domestic policy. To wit: 



A social order based purely on narrowly egoistic interests, neoconservatives argue, is unlikely to survive–and the closer one comes to it, the less liveable and sustainable society will become. Unable to generate a compelling vision of the collective public interest, such a society would be incapable of maintaining itself internally or defending itself externally. As a consequence, neoconservatism regards the ideas at the core of many forms of modern political and economic rationalism–that such a vision of interest can be the foundation for social order–as both wrong and dangerous. It is wrong because all functioning polities require some sense of shared values and common vision of the public interest in order to maintain themselves. It is dangerous because a purely egoistic conception of interest may actually contribute to the erosion of this sense of the public interest, and the individual habits of social virtue and commitment to common values that sustain it.



I am reminded of Irving Kristol’s statement that “A nation whose politics turn on the cost of false teeth is a nation whose politics are squalid.” It’s something of a parlor game in IR to debate whether neoconservatism is its own IR theory; whether it’s a theory at all, of anything; whether it’s really just liberalism; et cetera, but what would be really good to have is a clear statement that could be scrutinized on its own merit. Until then one is left guessing or, at best, turning up weird conspiracy theories about Leo Strauss and the University of Chicago on the internet.

"**The leader of a council with the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases in Wales has criticised national rules imposed on the local hospitality trade.**
Sam Rowlands from Conwy Council said he was disappointed the first minister had adopted a national approach rather consider regional differences in cases.
A new tier system is being brought in to manage the virus in England.
On Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a single set of rules made it easier for people to follow.
Conwy county has seen under 20 cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days, compared with an all Wales average of 189.8 cases per 100,000 people.
In an open letter to the first minister, Mr Rowlands highlighted his ""disappointment at the announcement of an all Wales set of further restrictions to the hospitality sector"" which employs 10,000 people across the county.
""There is not any significant concern with this sector as any spread of the virus we are currently seeing is through household transmission,"" wrote the Conservative councillor.
""I'm very disappointed to hear today that you're not looking to take into account any regional variance of the risk of the virus with restrictions you are considering in the lead up to Christmas.""
Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and currently close at 22:00 GMT.
New restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from 4 December.
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Coronavirus does not respect borders, whether they are in Wales or further afield.
""We need to use the coming weeks to reduce the spread of the virus and create more headroom for the Christmas period, for the whole of Wales.
""We are very aware that the hospitality sector has worked hard to put in place measures to protect the public and we know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry.
""However, new restrictions will need to focus on the places where we meet and where coronavirus thrives, drawing on the recent evidence from the UK Sage group of experts about what interventions have the biggest impact on the virus."""

"After ten years of negotiations, Russia’s Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) have announced they have signed a 30-year gas contract. Russia will from the end of this decade supply 38 billion cubic metres (bcm) per annum of gas to fuel the booming cities of northeast China, in a deal thought to be priced at US$350 per thousand cubic metres of gas – about the same price Russia sells to Europe – or around US$400 billion, according to Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller. President Putin has put the investment in gas field development and pipelines at US$55 billion, of which US$20-25 billion may be financed by China, either by pre-paying for its gas or through loans. The deal also entails other traditional features of long-term gas contracts such as linking the gas price to oil and oil product prices, and a take-or-pay clause to ensure minimum annual deliveries. So the deal appears to be commercially rational and beneficial for both parties. For Russia and Gazprom, the benefits are commercial and political. Gazprom’s vast gas resources in East Siberia, effectively stranded until now, have found a market and a price that will allow the company to make a reasonable 10% return on its investment in the project. Importantly, it will also lay the foundations for the expansion of Russia’s gas business into Asia. Gas exported as liquified natural gas (LNG) has been leaving the Sakhalin 2 terminal in Russia’s Far East since 2009. But the construction of the Power of Siberia pipeline, linking Vladivostok and Khabarovsk and the Yakutia gas and oilfields both to pipelines further west and to China, will open up significantly larger exports for China and also for the local domestic market, and potentially lead to an LNG liquefaction plant at Vladivostok. The new pipeline should also spur further development of new reserves discovered off Sakhalin Island.  Psychologically this deal has also demonstrated that, despite the protracted nature of the negotiations, Gazprom is able to successfully open up new avenues for its gas in an increasingly competitive global market. Politically, it has demonstrated that both Russia and Gazprom have options aside from its markets in Europe, which contribute around 50% of the company’s revenues at present. This point should not be overstated though; Europe has been Gazprom’s most important market for decades and will remain so for many years to come. But establishing an alternative equivalent to 25% of exports to Europe in 2013 does allow the company and the country the room to relax if Europe decides to aggressively remove its reliance on Russian energy. Realistically, this is unlikely: Europe has few alternatives, and exports to China are likely to be a bonus for Gazprom and the Russian treasury once the gas starts to flow by 2020. For China the deal is also positive for a number of reasons. The country’s gas demand is set to more than double by 2020 with a switch from coal to gas, and this will provide a significant new source of ongoing supplies. Now the Chinese gas import compass has a northern axis to add to its supplies from Central Asia in the west, Myanmar to the south, and from LNG supplies brought supplied from various sources to the east. The agreed price sets a useful benchmark that is competitive with China’s current imports, and provides a marker for future deals that should allow CNPC to start to close the gap between domestic and imported gas prices. Overall, both Russia and China have reasons to be happy with the eventual conclusion of these long-running negotiations. Russia can monetise new gas reserves and diversify it’s export markets while still making a reasonable rate of return, reducing reliance on Europe and building the foundations for substantial eastern markets. China has secured a competitively priced gas supply until 2050 that will when it starts meet 10% of estimated demand. It also helps further diversify its own imports while helping switch the country away from dirty coal that has choked its cities. It is a deal which makes considerable commercial and political sense, with the only surprise being that it has taken so long to conclude."
"**York Minster clergy say it is a ""blessing and a relief"" that worship can restart under new Covid rules.**
The city of York will enter tier two of the government's coronavirus restrictions next Wednesday.
The minster will re-open for public worship, but people will have to book online for the main services.
Rev Canon Vicky Johnson, precentor at York Minster, said there would be restrictions in place and Advent and Christmas would be very different.
She said: ""It is a blessing and a relief that worship and visiting can restart at York Minster and that we will be present for people as they prepare for Advent and Christmas.
""The ongoing need to control the virus means that capacity at services will be severely limited.
""Attendance at key services on Sundays and in Christmas Week will only be possible via our pre-booked online reservation system.
""However, digital worship has flourished at York Minster this year so all of our Advent and Christmas services and events, will be available digitally via livestream and on platforms such as YouTube and Facebook.""
The minster says it has implemented a range of measures to help keep visitors and staff safe, including compulsory mask wearing, limiting the number of people allowed inside, reduced seating and a one-way system.
Changes to services, include no singing and the suspension of the Holy Communion common cup, will continue.
Ahead of the reopening, one of the largest Advent wreaths in the UK was raised inside the minster.
The new Archbishop of York, The Most Reverend Stephen Cottrell, watched as the 4m-wide (13ft) wreath was lifted into place below the Central Tower.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you can’t find any real warming on the planet (which scientists haven’t been able to do now for 15 years), then you have to make up something that looks like warming, i.e. create dummy warming. This is precisely the case with a new paper on Western Antarctica.
==========================================
Western Antarctica warms more quickly than thought – however, hardly at all in the last 25 years
By Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
We recently got some hot news from Antarctica. According to a study by a team led by David Bromwich of Ohio State University in Columbus, which appeared just before Christmas 2012 in Nature Geoscience, Western Antarctica warmed up more quickly than first thought. This of course pleased alarmist newspapers like the online Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ), who without hesitation wrote:
With a temperature increase of 2.4°C since 1958, the central region of Western Antarctica is among the regions that are warming up the fastest on the planet. […] There the temperature is rising three times faster than the global average.”
Now that really stirs up fear. Global warming is apparently advancing rapidly in Western Antarctica and temperatures are climbing and climbing. This is taking place year after year, and so it is only a matter of time before the catastrophe strikes. To underpin this claim, the Süddeutsche Zeitung presents a temperature curve of Western Antarctica going back 55 years (Figure 1…in the SZ article it is necessary to click on the figure to see the curve). An enormous temperature jump is obvious beginning in the year 2000, as the temperature skyrockted. With another jump like that, the ice in Western Antarctica would never survive, one might think.

Figure 1: January temperatures of Western Antarctica. Source: Süddeutsche Zeitung, 23 Dec 2012.
But wait. When it comes the the Süddeutsche Zeitung one has to be a little careful. It has long been known that the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) is cozily cuddled together with climate alarmism (e.g. see our blog article“Schlimmer als befürchtet: Die Süddeutsche Zeitung verliert den klimawissenschaftlichen Boden unter den Füßen“ (Worse than we feared: The Süddeutsche Zeitung loses its scientific bearings). So let’s take a closer look.
Unfortunately we quickly discover mischief. The temperature curve for January readings used in the SZ does not even get mentioned or appear in the quoted paper. The warming value named by David Bromwich and colleagues has much more to do with the annual average temperature of the Western Antarctica, and whose curve is of course depicted in the paper (red curve in Figure 2). This curve, however, shows a completely different course than the one used by the SZ. Do you see it?
Crivens! In the last 25 years the West Antarctic has not gotten warmer! If anything, the temperature has remained flat. It is indeed quite a stretch to claim that Western Antarctica is among the most rapidly warming areas on the planet.
Over the last two decades temperatures in the region have gone nowhere.

Figure 2: Temperature development at Byrd-Station in Western Antarctica. Source: Realclimate.
And now if you look a little closer, you see that the warming is mainly concentrated in the period of approx. 1962-1980. Did mankind produce an extraordinary amount of CO2 during that particular period? No. The Co2 emissions were nothing different from what we had at other times. What is remarkable, however, is that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during this time went from a negative cool phase to a positive warm phase (Figure 3). It cannot be ruled out that this nearby climatic oceanic phenomenon may have had something significant to do with the Western Antarctic 2.4°C warming until 1980 mentioned in the paper. Moreover, there is also the warming due to the increase in solar activity and atmospheric CO2 concentration. The 2.4°C can be divided up into natural (ocean cycles and sun) and anthropogenic share (CO2, soot, etc.). The SZ could have mentioned that.

Figure 3: Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) over the last 110 years. 
Unfortunately the SZ reader is left alone with only the context of the article. According to new ICEsat satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet as a whole has increased in mass over the last years (see our blog article on this). The much larger Eastern Antarctica dominates, and that area has gotten colder over the last years. Also Antarctic sea ice reached a record high extent just a few months ago for the 30-year satellite era. Not a peep about both of these stories from the Munich-based SZ.
It also would have been nice if the SZ had provided its readers another important piece of background information: Unexpected but true: the post Ice Age temperatures at the Antarctic Penninsula were at today’s levels for 7000 years (also see our blog article on this here). With this background, the temperature development of the last 55 years discussed by the SZ loses considerable relevance. And it was also a pity for the SZ that David Bromwich and his team dumped cold water on their results for sea level rise. With gnashing teeth, the SZ had no alternative but to report:
Because at the high elevation Byrd-Region mean temperatures of -10°C prevail in the summertime, the warming does not lead directly to large-scale melting, say the scientists.”
It is quite amazing that the SZ creates almost only dramatic climate stories. Sober, non-alartmist reports just don’t seem to be of any interest for SZ editors. There’s plenty of non-alarmist material out there. At our blog we present new scientific results almost daily. We welcome editors at SZ to help themselves to it..

Peter Williams must be pleased to be free of the TVNZ censor. How it must have rankled with him to have to read all the auto-cue items on the TVNZ ‘news’ bulletins. He has now come out.



I am so over the nonsense that is being propagated by politicians and policymakers about this thing that is now just referred to as “climate change.”



Every day it is being foisted upon us. The world is in crisis. There is going to be a disaster, a catastrophe. The world is going to end. We have 12 years. We have 10 years. **Some nutbag appeared on The AM Show yesterday saying it will end in seven years**.



Prince Charles says we have 18 months left before it is irreversible and the world will end.



 **Why do we allow people to get away with this?** Why is there absolutely no debate that these prophets of gloom may possibly be wrong?



Why is it that not just Stuff, but it seems all media in this country refuse to allow even a skerrick of evidence that CO2 may not be the cause of the earth’s warming?



Those of us who ask questions, and do not accept what we are having forced upon us, are now being called deniers.



Note the phrasing, the use of language. As if words like catastrophe and crisis and emergency were not enough, those who are skeptical are now being called “deniers.”



The last group of people to be called deniers were those who believe the holocaust didn’t happen.



The thing is, we know the holocaust happened. We have physical evidence of graves, of concentration camps, of gas chambers and of people being loaded onto trains to go there and never be seen again.



How can people who ask questions about the changing climate and whether CO2 and other gases in the atmosphere be called “deniers?” The arrogance in the putdown is breathtaking.



 **Why are people not allowed to ask questions?** Why are people not allowed to make observations about what they see in front of them outside every day? Why are we not allowed to ask about all those other predictions of 30 years ago which have not come true?



Why am I so worked up about this? I’ll tell you why. **We are being fed BS by our politicians, politicians from both parties** who refuse to ask questions? Politicians and policymakers who use the phrase ” the science is settled.” Science can never be settled. How can science be settled? […]



It’s the same with weather and climate. How come the earth in the last 2000 years has been through multiple warming and cooling periods?



And remember the last 2000 years are just a blip on the length of time the solar system and planet earth has been in existence. 



That ridiculous interactive front of website piece on Stuff this morning tells us breathlessly that we have more CO2 in the atmosphere now than at any stage in the last 3 million years.



Wow – do you know how long this planet is estimated to have been in existence? 4.5 billion years. […]



Like, why is Greenland called Greenland? Because about a thousand years ago it was home to a population of Vikings who lived and thrived there in a climate that allowed food to grow and animals to be farmed. It was the era known as medieval warming. Then the Little Ice age came along and wiped that population out.



That little ice age ended in the first half of the 19th century. Since then the earth has been getting warmer. 



Now in this age of instant information, there is a lot of information available online which presents a different view of the world’s climate.  
The James Shaws of this world will say these people are climate change deniers? […]



This video asks questions. It challenges what has become the propagated modern-day story of CO2 induced climate change. It asks whether the sun could be the major player in the way the world’s climate has changed and continues to change. […]



Watch this and then ask – why are James Shaw and Julie Ann Genter and almost our entire Parliament doing what they are doing? […]



It is up to you to make up your own minds on this.



But if you listened to what Willie Soon and David Legates said, tell me they don’t know what they’re talking about.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis has released its annual data on compensation levels by industry (Tables 6.2D, 6.3D, and 6.6D here). The data show that the pay advantage enjoyed by federal civilian workers over private‐​sector workers continues to expand.   
  
  
The George W. Bush years were very lucrative for federal workers. In 2000, the average compensation (wages and benefits) of federal workers was 66 percent higher than the average compensation in the U.S. private sector. The new data show that average federal compensation is now more than double the average in the private sector.   
  
  
Figure 1 looks at average wages. In 2008, the average wage for 1.9 million federal civilian workers was $79,197, which compared to an average $50,028 for the nation’s 108 million private sector workers (measured in full‐​time equivalents). The figure shows that the federal pay advantage (the gap between the lines) is steadily increasing.   






Figure 2 shows that the federal advantage is even more pronounced when worker benefits are included. In 2008, federal worker compensation averaged a remarkable $119,982, which was more than double the private sector average of $59,909.   






What is going on here? Members of Congress who have large numbers of federal workers in their districts relentlessly push for expanding federal worker compensation. Also, the Bush administration had little interest in fiscal restraint, and it usually got rolled by the federal unions. The result has been an increasingly overpaid elite of government workers, who are insulated from the economic reality of recessions and from the tough competitive climate of the private sector.   
  
  
It’s time to put a stop to this. Federal wages should be frozen for a period of years, at least until the private‐​sector economy has recovered and average workers start seeing some wage gains of their own. At the same time, gold‐​plated federal benefit packages should be scaled back as unaffordable given today’s massive budget deficits. There are many qualitative benefits of government work—such as extremely high job security—so taxpayers should not have to pay for such lavish government pay packages.   
  
  
**Update:** I respond to some criticisms of this post here.   
  
  
**Update 2:** Compensation data for federal workers vs. other industries here.   
  
  
**Update 3:** In September, the government revised the data for private sector workers. On 9/30/09, Figure 1 and the related text were updated to reflect this change.

"We’ve just been through an unusually mild winter for the UK. Despite the excessive rain and storms, the warmer temperatures meant we’ve needed less energy to heat our homes.  This has reduced household energy bills, providing a welcome respite from ever increasing prices. But the weather has also had an undoubted benefit for the British economy, as we’ve had to import significantly less energy than would normally be the case.  Weather patterns are not under the control of legislators. But measures to promote energy efficiency are and could, if implemented on a large enough scale, produce an effect similar to a mild winter: warmer homes and less energy required to heat them. So just how big a difference did the weather make? Data released late last month from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) allows us to compare energy use during the two recent and contrasting winters: October 2013 to March 2014, which was unusually mild and the same period for 2012-13, which was colder than average. The data also enables us to compare the reduction in imports of primary energy during these periods, particularly coal and natural gas. These two fossil fuels are associated with electricity generation and heating – the areas most impacted by energy efficiency improvements in buildings. The DECC data shows that companies generating electricity used nearly 5.6m less tonnes of coal during winter 2013-14, compared to winter 2012-13. If we estimate, conservatively, that about 75% of the coal consumed is imported (there are only two deep coal mines still operational in Britain, Kellingley in Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire), this works out as a cut in coal imports of 3.9m tonnes, equivalent to 28,100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of thermal energy. At a cost of £70 per tonne, this represents a financial saving to the UK of £280m. The reduction in demand for electricity was also felt by gas-fired and nuclear power stations, but to a less significant degree than coal, and the amount of electricity generated from wind increased. The reduction in the use of coal to generate electricity was due to a genuine overall drop in electrical demand, not just substitution of one fuel for others. Other DECC data show a reduction of 83,000 GWh of natural gas consumed by the UK during the 2013-14 winter compared to 2012-13. The department’s statistics provide further detail on this reduction to show that overall imports were down by 60,000 GWh. This comprised 33,000 GWh less through the pipeline which runs across the Channel from Belgium, 19,000 GWh less from Norway, and 8,000 GWh less in the form of liquid natural gas by ship from Qatar. With wholesale natural gas costing around 1.5p per kWh, this adds up to a £900m saving from reduced natural gas imports.  Put the savings from coal and gas together, and we estimate that warmer-than-usual weather saved the UK nearly £1.2 billion in energy imports over the comparable six month period. This is a not inconsiderable sum – 3.5% of the 2012 UK trade deficit of £33.9 billion. So if the vagaries of the British weather can cut primary energy imports and result in a clear economic benefit to the UK by reducing its trade deficit, this is to be rightly welcomed. Especially as the UK becomes even more dependent on imports for its primary energy supplies. Why not then strive to ensure that these benefits are not just left to the weather, but could be enjoyed every year by improving buildings’ energy efficiency? It would seem an aim worthy of cross-party political support: reduce energy imports, improve the trade deficit, improve the UK’s housing stock and reduce fuel poverty. Maybe it is time that the wider macro-economic benefits were included in the debate around energy efficiency. Given the potential for significant and lasting improvements to UK’s trade deficit, why shouldn’t the Bank of England provide long-term funding to support energy efficiency measures? Like an energy efficiency equivalent of a War Bond. While cost is a major factor in the uptake of energy efficiency measures, there are also many non-financial barriers that have plagued schemes such as the Green Deal. Money spent on researching these factors for the benefit of advising legislators would be money well spent. If greater energy efficiency could produce the £1.2 billion saving equivalent to the mild winter, but every year – regardless of the weather, the Treasury should recognise the value of energy efficiency and give it the same political support as it would to increase UK exports by £1.2 billion. And the more energy the UK has to import in the future, the more valuable this saving may become. If ever there’s been a case of spend to save, this is it."

Europe’s bitter cold winter refuses to let up!
For some areas we are now hearing that it is being called the “100-year winter“!

Temperature forecast anomaly for the next 7 days. Source: http://wxmaps.org/html.
For example, Berlin’s online daily Tagesspiegel writes today:
Berlin freezes in 100-year winter.
Lots of snow and bitter cold until the end of March – Berlin hasn’t seen this in more than 100 years.”
Forget the tall tales spread by Mojib Latif. We haven’t forgotten what real winters are. We just haven’t seen anything like this since measurements began in 1895!

The Tagsspeigel writes:
‘There has never been anything like this in Berlin in the last third of March since snow measurements began in 1895,’ says weather expert Friedemann Schenk of the Meteorological Institute for the Freien Universität (FU).”
The English-language The Local here reports that Germans should not expect spring to arrive anytime soon, as the German Weather Service (DWD) warns that “the record-breaking wintry weather will continue until Easter“.
This weekend will be especially cold. T-online news site writes:
In the east, temperature readings will drop dramatically – many readings will be -10°C, as low as -13°C in some spots. ‘Some cold records for end of March will fall,” prophesies Ruhnau.”
Germany’s RBB forecasts temperatures down to -15°C! The extreme cold overall will make this March in Central Europe the coldest and snowiest in over 40 years – at least.
The Local adds:
Record-breaking levels of snow fell in other areas of the northeast – namely in Laage, Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania, where a blanket of 27 centimetres of snow smashed the region’s previous 2005 record for the time of year by six centimetres. ‘For March 20th, the amounts are impressively high,’ said Simon Tripper, a meteorologist from the DWD, on Wednesday afternoon. “

Environmentalism is the ultimate luxury item. Only the rich can afford to work themselves into a lather about the mooted possibility that people 100 years from now might be 2 percent less wealthy than they might otherwise have been. Ordinary people are too busy trying to make sure the lights and power stay on. People living in actual poverty are too selfishly concerned with trying to find something to eat and make sure their kids survive past five years old.



So it’s no coincidence that the so-called “schools climate strike” was mostly restricted to the privileged scions of the bourgeoisie attending wealthy private schools. Environmental activism is invariably the preserve of the idle middle-class who can afford to make a career out of annoying the hell out of people trying to work for a living.



A 20-year-old climate activist who glued himself to a road in a protest lives with his parents in a lavish mansion, it has been revealed.



Well, **there’s** a surprise.



Extinction Rebellion protester Eric Serge Herbert has been arrested five times for his demonstrations, which included blocking the entrance to the Brisbane Magistrates Court and stopping traffic with a canoe on a road. 



The former school captain was living in Sydney and studying nanoscience at the University of New South Wales before he dropped out and returned to his family home.



If you’re too thick to actually learn how to do something useful, just go and sponge off mummy and daddy. After all, mums and dads are wealthy enough to probably vote Green.



The waterfront five-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion in Pelican Waters on the Sunshine Coast also comes with a freestanding aquarium, vacuumaid, a triple lock garage and a private jetty, The Courier-Mail reported.



But they have solar panels, surely?



Despite claiming to create a classless society, communist regimes were invariably **obsessed** with class. While ostensibly lionising the proletariat, communist leaders were almost mostly drawn from the middle-classes. So, they invariably engaged in an elaborate charade of “prolier-than-thou”, desperate to disguise their bourgeois origins.



Nothing has changed.



Herbert has claimed on social media that he does not live with his parents, but during his first court appearance in June, the climate activist told the magistrate he lived with his parents who supported him…Herbert, who is unemployed, has been fined $2,050 and has stayed in the Brisbane watch house for several nights. 



Herbert, who is a triplet and one of five children, went to Unity College, a Catholic and Uniting Church school in Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast.



As Orwell noted in _The Road to Wigan Pier_ , “causes” like these attract the idle and the useless like “bluebottles to a dead cat”. Perhaps realising their essential uselessness, the pampered scions of the elite try to kid themselves that they’re part of some noble cause, rather than just worthless prats getting in the way of people who are actually doing something useful.



Herbert was fined $550 for gluing himself to a zebra crossing in Brisbane’s CBD and causing three hours of traffic chaos on June 17.



He was then handed a $600 fine for blocking Victoria Bridge with a canoe on June 26.



The climate activist blocked the entry of the Brisbane Magistrates Court on July 11 and was fined $400 and had a conviction recorded. Four days later he blocked streets in the city and was fined $500.



On July 17, Herbert was arrested for public nuisance and was bailed.



  
It’s high time police and the courts took up journalist Rita Panahi’s suggestion: just leave these stupid children right where they are – put a couple of traffic cones around them and let motorists take their chances.



They’ll unglue themselves and scurry back to their parents’ mansions in no time.

Brrr…the Troposphere Is Ignoring Your SUV
by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.
For those tracking the daily global temperature updates at the Discover website, you might have noticed the continuing drop this month in global temperatures. The mid-tropospheric AMSU channels are showing even cooler temperatures than we had at this date with the last (2008) La Nina. The following screen shot is for AMSU channel 6
click image to enlarge

A check of the lower stratospheric channels (9, 10) suggests this is not a stratospheric effect bleeding over into the tropospheric channels.
With the current (and forecast to continue) stormy pattern over the U.S., I have to wonder whether the atmosphere is currently in a destabilized state. I doubt that surface temperatures anomalies are as anomalously low as the mid-troposphere temperatures are running, which in combination with anomalously cold mid- and upper-tropospheric temperatures means there is extra energy available for storms. (Since AMSR-E failed in early October, our sea surface temperature plot is no longer showing current data, so I have no easy way to check surface temperatures.)
Of course, this too shall pass. I just thought it was an interesting curiosity during a time when some pundits are claiming global warming is “accelerating”. Apparently, they are still stuck in the last millennium.

Whenever you’re being regaled with a climate alarmist’s latest hysterical claim that the entire planet is on the cusp of being roasted to a cinder, the most important thing to keep in mind is that they’re almost certainly not talking about the real world. Instead, their scaremongering is almost certainly based on projections and computer models. If any real-world data is allowed to intrude, it’s been “adjusted” to within an inch of its life.



Computer models are not the real world, any more than Google Earth is an actual place. Climate models are _Matrix_ -like simulations… if the Matrix were a Donkey Kong style, 8-bit world of badly-rendered coloured blocks.



Climate models are in fact pretty lousy at simulating the real world. Which is why they have continually ‘run hot’, overestimating the amount of warming the world would actually see. Certainly, climate models are sophisticated computer simulations, but when it comes to sophistication, the real world knocks them out of the park. For instance, climate models still cannot accurately model what one might think is a pretty important factor: clouds. [Recent analysis](https://scitechdaily.com/climate-models-underestimate-the-cooling-effect-that-clouds-have/) suggests that models underestimate the cooling effect of clouds.



Now another study argues that models are underestimating the effect of vegetation on carbon dioxide absorption – and hence, climate.



Most Earth system models agree that land will continue to store carbon due to the physiological effects of rising CO2 concentration and climatic changes favoring plant growth in temperature-limited regions. But they largely disagree on the amount of carbon uptake…[Reseach] suggests that most models largely underestimate photosynthetic carbon fixation and therefore likely overestimate future atmospheric CO2 abundance and ensuing climate change.



This is important. Almost no one disagrees that atmospheric carbon dioxide affects the Earth’s climate to some degree. But everyone also knows that carbon dioxide is essentially ‘plant food’. Indeed, it is well known that the recent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide is correlated with a ‘global greening’ as the Earth’s vegetation increases. In turn, these new plants consume more CO2 – a process known as “enhanced photosynthetic carbon fixation”, or Gross Primary Production, GPP. The question, though, is how much does the ‘greening’, if any, offset increased carbon emissions, and how will this affect climate?



Predicting climate change requires knowing how much of the emitted CO2 (currently ~40 Pg CO2 _yr_ – _1_ ) will remain in the atmosphere (~46%) and how much will be stored in the oceans (~24%) and lands (~30%)…[these might] help to reduce uncertainty in multi-model projections of terrestrial carbon cycle entities.



The great boreal forests of Canada and the Russian Taiga are some of the most forested on Earth and have shown a distinct trend of increased leaf cover in recent decades.



This study is focused on the northern high latitudes (NHL, north of 60°N) where significant and linked changes in climate and vegetation have been observed in the past 3–4 decades…We therefore hypothesize that the greening sensitivity (i.e., leaf area index, LAI, changes in response to changes in the driver variables) inferred from the historical period of CO2 increase can be used to obtain a constrained estimate of future GPP enhancement from both the radiative and physiological effects.



…the available longest records of carbon exchange between the land/ocean and atmosphere (1980–2015) indicate that NHL lands changed from being a small carbon source in the early 1980s to a strong sink in the mid-2010s.



The question is, of course, are climate models accurately reflecting this trend? The answer is no. Most (CESM1-BGC, NorESM-ME, and CanESM2) strongly underestimate the amount of CO2 that global greening is scrubbing from the atmosphere. Some models overestimate. Only one (MIROC-ESM) matched the carbon-absorption data with any reliability.



The tendency for GPP underestimation in NHL by models reported here is also seen at the global scale This, together with another recent study, suggests that most models are underestimating photosynthetic carbon fixation by plants and thus possibly overestimating atmospheric CO2 and ensuing climatic changes.



  
There’s that “settled science” again.

"**Schools must be closed early ahead of the festive break to help children and teachers avoid having to self-isolate on Christmas Day, a union has warned.**
The UCAC teaching union said coronavirus cases in schools could force whole class ""bubbles"" into self-isolation over the holidays.
The union said schools should close on 11 December and move lessons online.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said there were no plans to close schools early.
In a letter to Education Minister Kirsty Williams, the union said there were ""serious concerns"" among UCAC members ""that pupils and students will continue to attend an educational setting a week before Christmas Day"".
Most schools are due to break up in the week starting 14 December, but if positive cases are found in pupils' class bubbles, children would have to self-isolate for two weeks, meaning some may have to isolate on Christmas Day.
""If a pupil or student tested positive with Covid-19 during the last week of term, it would mean that the whole bubble would have to self-isolate, preventing them from joining their extended family for Christmas,"" General Secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said in the letter.
""The same could be true for the education workforce.
""In addition, Test, Trace and Protect could continue to contact school and colleges leaders on Christmas Day, which is totally unacceptable.""
The union said that closing schools early would give families ""greater reassurance"" that they could get together to celebrate during the five day Christmas travel rules.
""We are acutely aware of the need to ensure continuity of learning for all pupils and students in Wales, particularly in the wake of the disruption earlier in the year, which has continued to some extent since September,"" the letter said.
""We believe that making an early announcement on this would not only allow the workforce to prepare thoroughly for that week, but also enable families to make alternative childcare arrangements as needed.""
It said a survey of members prompted a thousand responses with 75% in favour of online learning in the final week of term.
The union has also asked the minister to consider an alternative or parallel move to offer Covid tests to staff members once contact with pupils and students has come to an end, from 18 December onwards.
Some local authorities are also believed to be in favour of closing school sites a week early, though provision for children of key workers and vulnerable children would be one potential concern.
The latest Public Health Wales figures show that 50.3% of primary schools and 87.9% of secondary schools have had at least one Covid-19 case since the start of term.
There were 414 positive tests amongst school pupils or staff in the week up to 25 November.
However Mr Drakeford said he had ""no intention"" in allowing schools to close early.
""We will do everything we can to keep our schools working up until Christmas,"" he said during the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing on Friday.
""We'll do that alongside the unions, the head teachers and the local education authorities.
""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term. That's what we will be working to achieve."""
"The warning from the World Food Programme (WFP) that 265 million people could be pushed into acute food insecurity by Covid-19, almost doubling last year’s total, is based on a complex combination of factors. WFP’s latest warning underlines the increasing concern among experts in the field that for many the biggest impact will not be the disease, but the hunger hanging off its coat tails.  While the majority of people suffering acute food insecurity in 2019 lived in countries affected by conflict (77 million), climate change (34 million) and economic crises (24 million people), the coronavirus has massively complicated existing crises and threatens to worsen others. WFP sounded the alarm in concert with a report from the Global Network Against Food Crises – an international alliance working to address the root causes of extreme hunger – that disclosed that as 2019 ended, 135 million people across 55 countries and territories experienced the highest levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition documented by the network since the first edition of the report in 2017. The report identified a number of factors that could worsen food security in many of the 55 countries, classifying those dependent on food imports and oil exports (the price of oil collapsed to below zero this week) as particularly vulnerable, as well as those dependent and on tourism and remittances for income. “Rising unemployment and under-employment and decreasing purchasing power will have serious consequences for poor and vulnerable populations in countries already dealing with crises such as conflict and/or ongoing economic and political turmoil,” the report said. “Displaced people living in camps and displaced/host populations in urban settings as well as the elderly, young children, pregnant and lactating women, and the disabled are particularly vulnerable to the far-reaching impacts of this disease.” In Yemen, as Mark Lowcock, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator, told the Guardian earlier this week, UN agencies were already feeding 13 million people, amid a funding crisis that is threatening to many people before the impact of coronavirus is even taken into consideration. As WFP’s chief economist Arif Husain warned, “Covid-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread. It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock – like Covid-19 – to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.” The new warning reinforces concern sounded by Lola Castro, regional director of WFP for southern Africa, last month. She said the interruption of food programmes for millions of people in the 12 countries that they cover, which have experienced three years of poor harvests because of drought, would have a “critical impact”. As Castro and other experts have made clear, what is occurring as coronavirus begins to bear down on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries is a perfect storm that has seen coronavirus act as an accelerant on a host of well established problems from poverty, the impact of the climate crisis, pre-existing conflict and pre-existing health crises in places with high incidence of diseases like Aids and HIV and malaria. Perhaps most pressing, beyond the immediate threat of the disease, is the economic impact in countries less able to deal with the shock, particularly for workers on daily subsistence wages. Talking about the situation in southern Africa in an interview with the Guardian last month, Castro described the specific challenges in detail. “The lean season has been very, very hard for the last three years with almost no rain and poor harvests which have left 45 million people food insecure with 8.1 million supported by the WFP.” Already, as Castro points out, new restrictions on travel, border crossing and the threat of the disease has disrupted ongoing operations even as more people have been pushed towards poverty by lockdowns affecting their ability to work. “We are already the region of the world that is the most affected by HIV-Aids. We are having to totally change our distribution models: to reduce concentrations of people at distribution points; to make sure we have hand washing facilities and that people have PPE. “Then we have to defeat borders, airlines closing, ports becoming affected, shipping and transport … we are fighting a humungous number of factors today.” Other issues have been less visible, but are no less critical, not least any impact on southern Africa’s infrastructure for food supplies which depends on a few keys ports including Durban in South Africa and Beira in Mozambique. And as Andrew Shepherd of the UK’s Overseas Development Institute explains, the economic impact of coronavirus on the poorest will be felt most sharply. “Any food price inflation that is a result of coronavirus will be worst for those who are poorest, especially those who depend on daily wages. One of the impacts of the border closures that we’ve seen is that lots of poor people living along borders subsist on cross-border trading.”"

Eric Berger writes (excerpt below) at the Houston Chronicle “SciGuy” blog about the wicked hot record breaking temperatures people were getting in Houston on their iPhones. Turns out the whole issue is over station siting. While he located the station, doing some further investigation, I’ve got shots of the actual equipment and error analysis.
The curious case of why your iPhone reports crazy hot temperatures in Houston
Eric Berger – Houston Chronicle
Over the last several days I have seen a lot of reports on Twitter and elsewhere about very warm temperatures in Houston, a few degrees warmer than those being reported by the National Weather Service. They have come from people with iPhones.
For example the “Houston” location on your iPhone’s generic weather app reported a temperature of 109 degrees yesterday at 2:50 p.m. when in fact the official reading at Bush Intercontinental Airport at the time was 105.
Indeed no major weather station in the Houston area reported such a high temperature at the time. It got TechBlog‘s Dwight Silverman and I wondering what was going on. Where was Apple pulling this data from?

We started speculating on Twitter and didn’t begin to solve the mystery until Travis Tubbs chimed in.
After that Dwight archived the conversation in Storify, and it appears below (above), starting with Dwight’s initial tweet about the temperature getting back to a record 109 degrees Monday. (Officially, it didn’t. Monday’s high topped out at 107.)
…
So the mystery was solved, sort of. Apple gets its weather data from Yahoo!, which in turn gets it from The Weather Channel.
And for whatever reason the default iPhone weather data point is the Houston/Hermann Medical Center weather location. Whatever that is. It’s not an official National Weather Service site.
Full story here
===============================================================
No, it isn’t an official NOAA station, it serves the heliport. But it is a MADIS station, registered with NOAA, and used for other purposes such as MESONET.
Te lat/lon of the station is listed at the Gladstone CWOP metadata site as 29.7140 -95.3950 and that bring up this image on Google Earth:

Clearly the lat/lon places it on the roof in the helipad, but even at max zoom, I can’t make out any weather station. I was however able to see a helicopter on the pad and a windsock on the Bing Maps image and I theorized the weather station might share the mast with the windsock.

Fortunately, certain people like to photograph helicopters in action, and I was able to locate this shot from a photographer’s FLICKR collection that showed the station:
Photograph by Max Tribolet - click to enlarge
If you enlarge the photo, you’ll see the anemometer and wind vane, and what looks like a gill shield for the thermometer, though I can’t be certain. Even if it isn’t, the thermometer will be nearby to serve the helipad.
What I found most interesting though was the temperature analysis provided by the NOAA MADIS website. Apparently the problems with this station are well known.
==============================================================
Temperature




  24 hours
  Day time
  Night time


Average temperature error
-2.7 °F
-4.9 °F
-0.5 °F


Error standard deviation
3.3 °F
3.4 °F
0.9 °F


Worst average temperature error
-3.8 °F
-6.5 °F
-1.0 °F


Worst standard deviation
4.3 °F
6.2 °F
1.5 °F



NOTE: If the error above is POSITIVE, then it means that the analysis temperature is HIGHER than the reported temperature. This means that your sensor is reading COLDER than expected
================================================================
Worst daytime temperature error of 6.5F …wow.
A look at their graph is also telling:

As is the note below it (red color theirs):
Your readings indicate a solar heating problem. This means that the sun can shine directly onto the temperature sensor (or it’s housing) and increase the temperature recorded significantly. This is often caused by the lack of a radiation shield, or the sensor is poorly sited. For information on radiation shields, see CWOP Radiation Shields, and information on siting, see CWOP Station Guide.
With error magnitudes like that, perhaps the Weather Channel Might want to use a different source of station data for reporting Houston temperatures.
Again, siting is the issue. The station might be fine for reporting helipad conditions, and it might very well be that hot of the roof of that building. Knowing that accurately is important for the safety of the helicrew, especially on days of high humidity and high density altitude that sap rotor lift efficiency.
But it also underscore a point I’ve made time and again: rooftops aren’t a representaive location for climate monitoring, as we’ve seen a couple of days ago with this rooftop GHCN station # 2076548 photographed in Tampico, Mexico:

As we’ve seen time and again, GHCN stations are often sited at airports, and while runway and helipad conditions are imperative to know, especially when they differ from surrounding ambient, such stations sited in odd places don’t translate well for other applications, be it long term climate monitoring or a simple iPhone app for infotainment purposes.
If people reading iPhones can spot such problems and know the temperature data isn’t valid, and a citizen run CWOP program can use MADIS analysis of the data sight unseen and note it’s FUBAR, why can’t our meteorological experts at The Weather Channel figure it out?

Has it really come to this? Newt Gingrich as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney? That’s what many in the punditocracy have proclaimed as the former speaker of the House has surged recently in the polls.



Yet a look at his record reveals that Newt is hardly the “anti‐​Mitt” — he’s Mitt Romney with more baggage and bolder hand gestures.



Every Gingrich profile proclaims that he’s a dazzling “ideas man,” a “one‐​man think tank.” It seems that, if you clamor long enough about “big ideas,” people become convinced you actually have them.



But most of Gingrich’s policy ideas over the last decade have been tepidly conventional and consistent with the Big Government, Beltway Consensus.





[M]ost of Gingrich’s policy ideas over the last decade have been tepidly conventional and consistent with the Big Government, Beltway Consensus.



Gingrich’s campaign nearly imploded this summer when he dismissed Rep. Paul Ryan’s, R‐​Wis., Medicare reform plan as “right‐​wing social engineering.” But that gaffe was a window into Gingrich’s irresponsible approach toward entitlements.



In 2003, Gingrich stumped hard for President George W. Bush’s prescription drug bill, which has added about $17 trillion to Medicare’s unfunded liabilities. “Every conservative member of Congress should vote for this Medicare bill,” Newt urged.



And in his 2008 book _Real Change_ , he endorsed an individual mandate for health insurance.



In a 2006 piece for _Human Events_ , Gingrich offered House Republicans “11 Ways to Say: ‘We’re Not Nancy Pelosi.’ ” Point seven proposed a Solyndra‐​on‐​steroids industrial policy devoted to “developing more clean coal solutions, investing in a conversion to a hydrogen economy” and more. It’s not clear why the former madame speaker would complain.



It’s also unclear why anybody looking to distance himself from Pelosi would plop down on a love seat with her to call for government action on climate change — as Gingrich did in a 2008 television commercial.



It was a season of bipartisan chumminess for Newt. “Kerry and Gingrich Hugging Trees — and (Almost) Each Other,” the _Washington Post_ described a 2007 global warming event Gingrich headlined with Sen. John Kerry, D‐​Mass.



On foreign affairs, Gingrich’s ideas are a little less conventional, but his apocalyptic saber rattling hardly instills confidence. “We need a calm, reasoned dialogue about the genuine possibility of a second Holocaust,” he told an American Enterprise Institute audience in 2007.



In 2009, he proposed zapping a North Korean missile site with laser weapons. (“Beam me up, Mr. Speaker!” as former Rep. James Traficant, D‐​Ohio, used to say in the ‘90s.)



There’s no denying that Newt is smart, but there’s a zany, Cliff Clavin aspect to his intellect. At times, Gingrich, who’s written more than 150 book reviews on Ama​zon​.com, sounds like a guy who read way too much during a long prison stretch.



The former speaker’s immense self‐​regard is evident in one of the exhibits to a 1997 House Ethics Committee report on him. In a handwritten 1992 note to himself, he wrote: “Gingrich — primary mission, Advocate of civilization, definer of civilization, Teacher of the rules of civilization, arouser of those who fan civilization, … leader (possibly) of the civilizing forces.” Whew!



When he’s not leading the assembled armies of civilization in a Thermopylae‐​style battle against “Obama’s Secular Socialist Machine,” Newt does a little consulting on the side.



In 2009, the ethanol lobby paid his firm $312,000, and in 2006, the former speaker scored a $300,000 fee from Freddie Mac, one of the government‐​sponsored enterprises that helped pump up the disastrous housing bubble.



They sought “my advice as an historian,” Gingrich later explained. (Maybe they were impressed by all those Amazon reviews).



Newt may be a poor fit for the role of “anti‐​Romney,” but you can say one thing for him: He knows how to play the Washington Game.

From the AGU highlights

Despite the fact that average temperatures on land have been increasing from year to year, globally averaged surface temperatures from 2000 to 2010 have shown only moderate warming. This is because sea surface temperatures over the past decade have been flat, if not slightly decreasing. In light of this, scientists are curious about whether this reduced rate of surface warming indicates a reduction of the accumulation of heat in the Earth system over the same period.
Palmer et al. use multicentury climate model simulations to study the relationships among decadal trends in top-of-atmosphere radiation balance (which controls the heat content of the Earth system), ocean heat content, and surface temperature. Consistent with previous studies, they find that all models show large variability in sea surface temperature (SST). This large internal variability in SST could easily “mask the anthropogenic warming signal for a decade or more,” the authors note. By contrast, ocean heat content more closely tracks the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere, suggesting that measurements of ocean heat to deeper levels would help us monitor climate change more accurately.

Importance of the deep ocean for estimating decadal changes in Earth’s radiation balance
Key Points

Decadal trends in SST place only weak constraint on TOA
As we measure OHC deeper, we gain increasingly good predictions of TOA
Trade-off between measuring longer or deeper for given uncertainty in TOA


Abstract:

We use control run data from three Met Office Hadley Centre climate models to investigate the relationship between: net top-of-atmosphere radiation balance (TOA), globally averaged sea surface temperature (SST); and globally averaged ocean heat content (OHC) on decadal timescales. All three models show substantial decadal variability in SST, which could easily mask the long-term warming associated with anthropogenic climate change over a decade. Regression analyses are used to estimate the uncertainty of TOA, given the trend in SST or OHC over the same period. We show that decadal trends in SST are only weakly indicative of changes in TOA. Trends in total OHC strongly constrain TOA, since the ocean is the primary heat store in the Earth System. Integrating OHC over increasing model levels, provides an increasingly good indication of TOA changes. To achieve a given accuracy in TOA estimated from OHC we find that there is a trade-off between measuring for longer or deeper. Our model results suggest that there is potential for substantial improvement in our ability to monitor Earth’s radiation balance by more comprehensive observation of the global ocean.

"When former Mexican president Felipe Calderon shut down the development of a planned US$2 billion, 4,000 hectare hotel mega-resort in 2012, it looked as though the extraordinary diversity of the Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park had escaped unscathed. But barely a few years later new plans have arisen for the site in the country’s north east after ownership transferred from the now-bankrupt Spanish property company to a Chinese development firm, Glorious Earth Holdings. The planned 22,000-room hotel development on the Baja Californian coastline threatens not just the future of the coral reef, but also those species and habitats on land. Named “Cabo Dorado”, this is the third iteration for a mega-resort on the site. The core of the proposed development is the picturesque beach dunes of Punta Arena, where the desert meets the sea. This is no ordinary sea: Cabo Pulmo National Park is perhaps the world’s most robust marine reserve and coral reef. Legendary underwater photographer and explorer Jacques Cousteau referred to the area as “the aquarium of the world”. So while the significance of the coral reef is well recognised, the biological diversity of Punta Arena and around has remained unknown.  Faced with potential destruction, our internationa team of scientists set about recording the plants and animals in the region, under the umbrella of a US-Mexican collaborative group dedicated to protecting the Sonoaran Desert and led by noted conservationist Exequiel Ezcurra, professor of ecology at the University of California, Riverside. We were alarmed by what we discovered in the heart of the development zone that would be concreted. Published in a recent report, we found 560 types of plants and animals, but also two vegetation types found nowhere else on earth, and two newly described plant species known only from these 11 square kilometres. The sands of Punta Arena feature seasonally flooded lagoons and a thorn desertscrub that, due to the underlying geology, produce wholly unique soils. The plants, Bidens cabopulmoensis, a dune sunflower, and a large shrub, Pisonia calafia, are in serious danger of extinction if this project goes ahead. There are also many endemic species of reptiles, including active sea turtle nests on the beaches. In contrast to our findings, the environmental impact statement (MIA, or Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental) undertaken on behalf of the developers stated there was nothing unique in the area. The MIA omitted 83% of the species found only in the region and nowhere else in the world, recorded 400 fewer plants and animals, and noted only 15 species protected by the Mexican government – compared to the 42 we found. But these concerns are only part of the story. What will the impact of this mega-development be on the remarkable reef-system that is the heart of the region’s ecotourism and fishing industries? Where will the fresh water come from in the middle of this desert? The calculations for the water needed by the proposed development are a source of great concern for local businesses that depend on the aquifer. We need to take a careful look at this kind of large development project. Far too many times along the coasts of Mexico we have witnessed the wholesale destruction of areas of great biological and cultural importance. On the headlands and mangrove estuaries of La Paz, Loreto, and other Baja California coastal cites, biologically important land has been razed for ambitious hotels and apartments, only for these buildings to be subsequently abandoned, to no one’s benefit and at great cost. By incorporating the extraordinary natural wealth of the region into development and building projects we can pursue a much more prosperous vision of the future for  Baja California that matches the grandeur of landscape.  It’s clear the impact this mega-resort would have on local businesses, people and the landscape has not been adequately addressed. For example, the people of Cabo Pulmo – sustained almost entirely by ecotourism – face the imminent loss of the natural resources that provide them a living if the proposal is approved by the Mexican government. In our final report, which we delivered to the environment department of the Mexican federal government, we recommend expanding the Cabo Pulmo National Park to include Punta Arena. The government is expected to make a decision by June 15. Hopefully this scheme can slayed a fourth time, and the area sufficiently protected to prevent it rising again in the future."
"Monarch butterflies are known for their striking flame-orange and black appearance, and especially for their mass migration in their millions to spend winters in the mountain forests of Mexico. But despite growing problems with deforestation in Mexico, their struggle begins at home in the United States and Canada. The butterflies that fly to Mexico are the great-great-great grandchildren of the monarchs that were in Mexico the previous winter. In 2013 the overwintering population in Mexico covered 0.67 hectares of fir forest (about 44 million butterflies) the lowest since counts began in 1994. Since 1999 their numbers have declined 82%. What could have caused this? During their larval stage monarchs, which can be found from the US central states to the east coast and into southern Canada, feed exclusively on milkweed plants. We observed in 2001 that many monarchs were feeding on milkweeds in agricultural fields – more than 80% of monarchs from the Midwest. Since then, milkweeds in and around agricultural crop fields have gradually been eliminated, through a combination of spraying with Roundup (glyphosate) herbicide and increased planting of corn and soybeans genetically modified to be resistant to the herbicide.  In previous studies, we’ve shown that the magnitude of monarch population decline in Mexico matched the magnitude of the decline in the abundance of milkweeds in butterflies’ prime breeding habitat – the Corn Belt region of the US. This strongly suggests that milkweed loss is the primary factor in the species’ decline.  In a recently published paper, Tyler Flockhart and colleagues in Canada and Australia examined the monarch population decline and tried to gauge the relative roles of all the factors that may lie behind it. Besides the loss of milkweeds in the breeding area, these include climate change, the loss of forests at the overwintering sites, and occasional catastrophic weather events. The research team developed a population model that incorporated information about birth and death rates for each of the roughly four generations that comprise the monarch annual migration cycle. A number of pieces of information necessary to generate such a population model are unknown or poorly known, so assumptions had to be made. With that caveat, they were able to confirm that the primary driving force behind the population decline was loss of milkweeds in the breeding area, with the other factors playing a minor role. With population models, not only can you examine the past but also extrapolate into the future. The good news is that the population model projects the population to decline by only a further 14% over the next century – much less than the precipitous drop in numbers over the last 20 years. The bad news is that the new, much lower population level makes the species more vulnerable to events such as catastrophic heatwaves or severe winters that can wipe out millions at a stroke. The model puts the chance of population extinction in the next century at a low but distinctly non-trivial 5%. The chief reason why future declines will not be as pronounced is because milkweeds have been virtually eliminated from farmland, meaning that losses stemming from that habitat have already been accounted for. At present there are two main habitats that provide milkweeds for monarch butterflies.  The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides incentives to farmers to set aside land from growing crops. This land is typically planted with grasses to prevent erosion but often has milkweeds. I have estimated that there are 1.4m hectares (3.6m acres) of CRP land in the Midwest providing suitable milkweed habitat – if there were incentives for farmers to plant milkweed on their CRP land, this could prevent further declines and even promote a population comeback. Unfortunately at present the high demand for corn means farmers are tempted to convert CRP land back to crops.  The second important habitat is roadsides. Transportation Department officials need to be informed about the impact of roadside management practices, such as spraying with herbicide and mowing, on monarchs. Incentives to plant other flowering species besides milkweed in CRP land and roadsides would help. Pollinators such as bees and butterflies are in serious decline, largely due to loss of habitat. Other threats to pollinators such as the widespread use of insecticides such as neonicotinoids could also be eliminated."

Enough already!   
  
Why is Congress, the President, or anyone else, still talking about the Keystone XL pipeline?   
  
This project is so small in the grand scheme of _any_ thing it boggles the mind anyone outside of those directly involved in building and operating it gives it a second thought.   
  
That a discussion of the pipeline is still consuming government resources some six years after it was originally proposed epitomizes the grand waste of time and money that characterizes the current Administration when it comes to anything it thinks causes dreaded global warming.   
  
In this case, the fault lies squarely with President Obama.   
  
He could have killed the pipeline years ago if he wanted. Or better yet, he could have approved the pipeline years ago and we would now be reaping the benefits of it in whatever form those benefits may have taken (choose your favorites from among the lists that likely includes jobs, tax revenues, lower gas prices, energy security, ally cooperation, etc.).   
  
But he did neither.   




His highest priority seems to be leaving a lasting legacy of “doing something” about climate change. Again, his own EPA should tell him that even if we cut our emissions to _zero_ , today, the amount of warming that would be “prevented” by 2100 is a mere 0.14°C.   
  
And the Keystone XL pipeline is one of his biggest tools to keep planetary warming alive, at least in the media. As long as it is in limbo, people keep talking about it, protestors keep protesting about it, supporters keep lobbying for it, newspapers keep writing about it, and the rest of us are caught up in the spectacle.   
  
The State Department has already found that the environmental impacts and risks from the project are acceptably low. I have already pointed out (to Congress even) the climate impacts of the project are nil. And all the while the Keystone XL pipeline has been delayed, the Alberta tar sands oil production has increased and is in the process of finding other ways onto the global market. Even the Nebraska court case that is often cited by the President as a reason for delaying a decision on the pipeline is more of a procedural issue than a real threat to the pipeline.   
  
At this point, the Keystone XL is just another construction project. In fact, that is all it ever was. If it didn’t require crossing the border with Canada (which required a “presidential permit”), we never would have heard a peep about it.   
  
The _USAToday_ appropriately and succinctly summed up the situation in a recent editorial:   




Keystone is not an existential issue. It's a 1,179-mile oil pipeline in a nation already crisscrossed by more than 150,000 miles of such pipelines. It's long past time to say yes.



Agree completely. It high is time for the federal government to put this issue to rest and get down to issues actually deserving of this much attention (but don’t bet on it!).

"The climate is warming, and so basic logic would suggest we should expect fewer bouts of cold weather. Yet severe winter weather, such as the cold wave over the US this year, and the chilly winter of 2009/10 in the UK have left people questioning this assumption.  In early January 2014, across North America record minimum temperatures for the date were set at many weather stations, including at Chicago O’Hare Airport (-26.7°C, January 6), New York Central Park, (-15.6°C/4°F, January 7) and Washington DC Dulles Airport (-17.2°C, January 7). Daily maximum snowfall records were also broken at several stations. The cold temperatures and heavy snowfall caused widespread disruption to transport and power supply, closure of work places and public services, and damage to crops. Unsurprisingly given the disruption, the national and global media extensively reported the cold wave, including debate on whether or not human-induced climate change was partly responsible. One particular hypothesis garnered a lot of attention: the suggestion that rapid Arctic warming and associated sea ice loss may be increasing the risk of cold extremes.  The theory goes something like this: as the Arctic has warmed more rapidly than places further south, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification, the north-south temperature gradient has weakened. This temperature gradient powers the jetstream, a strong wind, high in the atmosphere that marks the boundary between cold Arctic air and warmer air to the south. A weaker north-south temperature gradient may cause a weaker jetstream. It’s also argued that a weaker jetstream will meander more, a bit like a river meanders more when the current is slower. When large southward meanders develop, Arctic air pushes south leading to cold conditions. This hypothesis has led to recent claims that Arctic warming will lead to more cold weather. My latest research published in the Nature Climate Change journal, analyses thousands of weather records and suggest a more important – and remarkably simple – connection between Arctic warming and our weather. This link implies the opposite, that rapid Arctic warming will lead to fewer, not more, cold extremes. Generally speaking (in the northern hemisphere), when the wind blows from the north temperatures tend to be colder than average. Conversely, when the wind blows from the south temperatures tend to be warmer than average. Cold extremes, those really cold days, occur most frequently when the wind is from the north. This is no real surprise, as the poles are cold and the tropics and equator to our south are warm.  What the data shows, however, is that days in autumn and winter with northerly winds (blowing from the north) have warmed significantly more than days with southerly winds. The result is a levelling off of temperatures at a new, warmer average as cold days’ temperatures rise towards the temperatures of warm days faster than the warm days themselves increase in temperature. Scientists call this a decrease in temperature variance, and it implies fewer temperature extremes, in this case notably fewer cold extremes. Again, this makes perfect sense if you consider that the Arctic has warmed more rapidly than places further south. Cold northerly winds are not as cold as they were in the past, because the Arctic air they bring is, like the rest of the Arctic, considerably warmer than it once was. The latest climate models suggest that these changes will continue and become more widespread in the future. I examined simulations from 34 different climate models, each run with projected increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. The models all agree that temperatures will warm in all seasons. Towards the pole beyond 40 degrees north, which includes large parts of US, Europe and Asia, temperatures are anticipated to become less variable in all seasons except summer. A warmer and less variable climate has fewer cold extremes.  There is still a lot to understand about how the dramatic changes occurring in the Arctic will affect weather patterns further south – in particular, if and how the jetstream might be affected will be vital. But there is strong evidence that Arctic warming is taking the edge off those cold northerly winds, meaning the risk of extreme cold waves like that experienced in the US becomes rarer still. "
"Among the UK government’s pronouncements for the new parliamentary session were measures designed to boost zero-carbon home building in order to reap the benefits of lower emissions, lower household energy bills, and more comfortable homes. It’s a shame then that the government’s flagship scheme for ensuring existing homes receive energy efficiency upgrades, the Green Deal, is languishing. The Department for Energy and Climate Change had estimated that by 2020 the Green Deal would have helped fund the retrofitting of 14m homes, almost 2m homes per year. But official figures from April 2014 show only 1,178 homes had been refurbished, with another 1,261 in the pipeline. While there have been more than 200,000 Green Deal assessments since the scheme’s start in January 2013, the vast majority of households decided against it, instead taking advantage of funding provided through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) under which, for those homes that meet the criteria, the bill is picked up by energy supplier companies. So there is no revolutionary upgrade of British homes taking place, and this is reflected in DECC’s estimate that the Green Deal will make up just 1% of predicted energy savings by 2020, as shown in the graph below. In comparison, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (the Green Deal’s predecessor) is projected to deliver almost 25% of all savings in 2020. Despite these obvious failings, the government announced substantial cuts to ECO this year, requiring suppliers to deliver significantly less energy efficiency measures. Overall, there are far fewer energy efficiency retrofits taking place than before the Green Deal was introduced, something Dr Nick Eyre from Oxford University and I anticipated two years ago. So where do we go from here? The pay-as-you-save concept of the Green Deal – in which the cost of the loan for energy efficiency improvements is paid for from the monthly savings they provide from household energy bills – is compelling, particularly as it helps to solve the landlord-tenant dilemma where the landlord bears the costs of making improvements, but the tenant reaps the benefits. Governments across Europe were interested to see if it could work in their own countries.  The challenge is to take the best aspects of the scheme and make it work better. In my view, there are three main areas that need to be considered – a new marketing approach, a relaxed golden rule, and a more attractive interest rate. The Green Deal was mainly sold as a means to save households money, but critics pointed out that, as repayments are calculated from estimated rather than actual energy bill savings, they might conceivably be larger than the savings made. A new approach should emphasise the non-financial benefits, such as comfort or adding to the value of the house. For example, in Germany households take out huge loans of up to £60,000 provided by the publicly owned KfW Banking Group. While in most cases the bill savings do not pay back the loan over the time a household occupies the property, the programme has been successful because it is seen as a way of financing home improvements, making houses more saleable, and making people feel more comfortable in their homes. At the heart of the scheme is the golden rule, which stipulates that the cost of the repayments must not exceed the (estimated) energy savings. This implies that the scheme can only finance measures with a relatively short pay-back period – but such measures usually come with moderate up-front costs, and many of these are likely to be financed through ECO in the future. Experience shows that people are most likely to take out loans for measures that have high up-front costs and have long pay-back periods. Proposed changes to ECO will leave significantly less support for more expensive measures such as solid wall insulation, meaning households will have to find other sources of finance for the remaining cost, which may put them off. The newly announced Green Deal Home Improvement Fund provides extra finance in the form of direct grants, but this is a one-off programme with only limited funding available. I don’t think this is a long-term solution. For those households willing to take out loans, even if the costs of repayments are higher than the energy savings, government should relax the golden rule, leading to a wider range of measures being available on the scheme without the need for householders to find additional funding. The interest rate of a Green Deal loan at 7% is deemed commercially attractive against comparable unsecured loans. However, households are more likely to compare the Green Deal interest rate to that of their mortgage, or to high street loans, which means the interest rate needs to be set closer to 3% or less in order to appear attractive.  International experience with low-interest loan programmes has shown that if the interest rate is sufficiently low the market follows – the German KfW loan programme’s interest rate is 1%, for example, and the scheme has been oversubscribed for years. In France consumers have access to a 0% loan scheme for energy efficiency improvements. Establishing such schemes requires considerable public subsidies but research by Ricardo-AEA and others has shown that the Treasury could recoup some or even all of those costs. The Treasury could even end up profiting from the scheme as it is budget positive, creating more revenues and savings than it costs.  It does seem DECC is rethinking the Green Deal, with the new Home Improvement Fund providing attractive incentives to encourage home retrofits. It is a short-term measure but a step in the right direction as high take up in the first week already shows.  Making changes to the scheme quickly has the potential to turn it into a real success story. But if there’s no new deal soon, the Green Deal may not have a long term future."

Satire



I’m here to help you right-wing, nut-job, conspiracy-theory, alternative-fact, tin-hat wearing deplorables because, believe me, you need it.



We at _Stuff_ , the saviours of the entire huperson race, have declared a Climate Emergency and you people don’t appear to be taking it seriously, at all. Shame on you. Now, thanks to you fossil-fuel fan-girls and boys the ARCTIC IS ON FIRE!!! Did you hear me? THE ICE is ON FIRE!!! All thanks to you and your global warming. 



See what you’ve done, are you happy now?



Ha! “It’s the opposite of hell freezing over”. When are you folks going to grow up, accept some culpability for this overheated planet, and take some responsibility? For heaven’s sake, get with our noble cause before it’s too late!



What’s that, I hear you say? ‘Fires in the Arctic Circle forests are not at all unusual.’ Well; that’s true, but we clearly state that fact in the body of the story so it’s only the headline that’s entirely misleading…we stand by the article. 



Next? ‘It’s not a satellite image’? Well, the article says it’s a satellite image, yes, but, okay – it’s not, fair point. It’s not a satellite image; it’s representative, it’s to invoke a reaction from simpletons that refuse to follow our superior moral imperatives for whatever reason [snort]. 



What’s that? ‘There’s no smoke, it’s cloud, there is no fire’…oh, oops – see reasons above. 



Next?… It’s not recent, the photo is thirty-seven years old, and it’s doctored…it’s a crop from an image depicting an oil tanker being loaded’. No, no, I assure you, we would never use a picture of anything oily unless of an Albatross, dyed and sad-faced. You have proof?…



Oh dear [sigh]! Okay, that’s it, I can only take one more criticism of our wonderful story…you, sir; what would you like to point out? 



Oh…! Valdez, Alaska, is not even in the Arctic Circle? Are you kidding me?…No, you’re not; ‘It’s nearly 500 kilometres below it’…Uhm, well…that’s the latitude quality journalism allows us, that’s all I want to say. So, ok, ok: 



But, apart from that, do you fossil-fools believe us now? Like we said at the outset: It’s a crisis, a real Climate Imagineracy. Please take us much more seriously going forward.



 _(Stuff may tell the truth when hell freezes over, but in the meantime – not so much.)_

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline news weekly FOCUS reports on the overnight damage from Germany’s record March cold with the headline this morning:
100-year event in March –
 Greenland icy air smashes cold records in the East
Cold records were set during the night at many locations in the eastern part of Germany. “The windchill pushed felt-temperatures down to – 30°C.”
Readings of -13°C to – 16°C were recorded at a number of locations at elevations above 1000m. “For the last 10 days of March, this has not happened in decades. Such masses of cold air do not reach Germany even in the dead of winter in some years,” FOCUS writes.
Because some stations in Germany have been keeping weather records for as long as 300 years, e.g. Dresden, Braunschweig and Potsdam, “scientists consider it appropriate to call it an event of the century,” FOCUS reports.
The bitter cold is exacerbated by strong, gusty winds blowing from Russia. With the wind, “temperatures felt like -23°C in parts of of the East on Sunday morning. On the Brocken in Harz the windchill was -33°C.”
Wetterkontur.de provides a list of some of the overnight lows recorded early this morning.
FOCUS quotes Eva Willa of the German Weather Service (DWD) in Potsdam this morning:

For the end of March, Brandenburg has never been so cold since the beginning of temperature measurements.”
“Coldest March in 100 years”
Online Bild newspaper this morning interviewed five experts: Thomas Marschall, Dominik Jung, Dr. Henning Baberg, Lars Lachmann und Thomas Endrula.
Endrula: “We are now experiencing the coldest March in 100 years.”
Not only has the winter been cold and dark, but it has also been a long one. Jung: “It was very long, the first snow arrived at places already at the end of October.”

"When news of the pandemic broke in California and we were ordered to shelter at home, many of us rifled through our closets for our bulk packages of protective N95 masks that we’d worn in last year’s fire, and the fires the year before that, and the fires the year before that, and wondered if we should donate them to the hospitals or keep them for ourselves. This time, wearing masks was about protecting the vulnerable and at-risk from ourselves. But we will need the masks to protect ourselves from the fires that will likely come back this summer and fall. Presumably, there won’t be any N95 masks left by that time, when we’ll need protection from the smoke if we’re ordered to evacuate, as we had to last year, for more than a week, when the Kincade fire scorched 77,758 acres of our county of Sonoma.  In 2018, fires burned nearly 2 million acres in California. And in 2017, fire charred through a significant portion of my hometown. When the university where I teach recently closed for the semester because of shelter-at-home orders, it was the fourth closure in three years (the other three due to fires or smoke from fires). You could hear the weary tone in the administrators’ emails, thanking us for being attentive, yet again, to the needs of our traumatised students. During the first disorienting week of shelter at home, we whispered to our climate emergency friends: “Psst! Isn’t this what we’ve been hoping for? The sudden reduction in air travel? The shrinkage in fossil fuel emissions? Did you hear greenhouse gases dropped 25% in China during February? And people are taking online classes in carbon sequestration gardening techniques? And that judge finally cancelled a key permit for the Dakota Access pipeline?” It felt, at first, like some sort of divine intervention. I couldn’t get the Anna Akhmatova poem out of my head: “Everything is plundered, betrayed, and spent / the wings of black death have flown by / why, then, do we feel so radiant?” In any case, this stay-at-home remedy for the pandemic was a far superior experience to what we go through during fires. We could breathe fresh air! At least, those of us who didn’t have the virus. But as the reality of the economic toll set in, as well as the realisation that Donald Trump was using this opportunity to roll back more environmental restrictions, and realised that marginalised people were the ones dying in largest numbers, it became evident that there was no real silver lining. All around were the same symptoms of a system heading in the wrong direction. One student wrote to me: “I’m looking forward to things getting normal again.” The only problem is that things weren’t normal before. And when the winds pick up this October, electricity and gas provider PG&E will, most likely, turn off the power for one, two or maybe more weeks to try to avoid another catastrophic conflagration due to a drought-diseased tree crashing onto a live power line and burning up the region. If we are still sheltering at home, no power means no internet, no Zoom, no Netflix. More importantly, when the fires come, where and how will we evacuate while physical distancing? After the fires, any illusions we had held that humanity could triumph over nature came apart. When Covid-19 erupted, it felt a little like a “Hold my beer. We’ve got this!” kind of moment, not because we had any control – quite the opposite – but because we’d had an apprenticeship with our own powerlessness against the forces of nature. But that powerlessness realigns us to the patterns of a more profound reality than our own. I’m deeply heartened, even astonished by the unprecedented rising global solidarity, this communitas, in response to the pandemic, and what it promises we are capable of. It’s too soon to measure how this global pause will affect global greenhouse emissions. Early estimates predict a 5% decline this year, but short of the 7.6% needed every year for 10 years to limit warming to 1.5C. Clearly this stay-at-home method, leading to a potential economic collapse, isn’t the best way to bring down emissions. Others have written convincingly how a New Green Deal makes more economic sense than trying to prop up a collapsing fossil fuel industry, how, in the US, 5.2m permanent clean-energy jobs could replace the 2.2m fossil-fuel job loss. Having said that, I think we have put too little emphasis protecting the planet by understanding, honouring, and facilitating its life-sustaining processes and carbon sinks. Perhaps staying home gives us some time to observe these processes. We must stay six feet apart from each other, but not from the Earth. • Christina Nichol is the author of the novel Waiting for the Electricity. She lives in northern California"

================================================
New Study in Nature: East African Drought Trend Part of a Natural Cycle
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)

Figure 1: Moisture development of East Africa over the past 700 years. Source: Tierney et al. 2013.
East Africa has gotten drier over the last decades, suffering from drought. Those responsible for this misery were quickly found: It had to be man. His rising CO2 emissions must have irreversibly damaged the East African climate, and driven the rains off for good. This is pretty much how many environmental and aid organizations have been arguing, e.g. Aktion Deutschland Hilft or Greenpeace. Of course, you don’t have to be a marketing expert or psychologist to see the real intentions of these accusations. With feelings of guilt, donations come pouring in.
Now a new publication in the journal Nature casts serious doubt on the supposed man-made East African drought assumption. US scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, led by Jessica Tierney, have taken a closer look at moisture trends in East Africa and have uncovered a surprise. Using geological reconstructions, the scientists were indeed able to confirm that East Africa has dried out during the past decade. However, the group also succeeded in reconstructing the data all the way back to the year 1300 (See Figure 1 above).
As Figure 1 shows, the drought of the last decade is simply all part of a broader natural cycle that has been occurring over hundreds of years. Contrary to what was assumed earlier, the drying out did not first begin in the second half of the 20th century, but already at the end of the 18th century. A pronounced wet period prevailed in East Africa between 1680 and 1765 (Figure 1), which corresponds to the Little Ice Age – a time when global mean temperature was more than 1°C colder than today. Interestingly, East Africa was just as dry back in the 14th and 15th centuries as it is today. Clearly CO2 could not have been responsible for that.
Therefore Jessica Tierney and her team started looking for a natural driver for East Africa’s moisture development. They compared the drought data with the temperature development in the Indian Ocean. Lo and behold: both curves showed a high degree of similarity. Obviously the rain in East Africa is driven significantly by the Indian Ocean. Whenever the India Ocean is cool, the rains in East Africa increase. And when the Indian Ocean is warm, the rains become more seldom (see Figure 2):

In turns out that the temperature curve of the Makassar Strait near Indonesia also closely reflects global mean temperature (Figure 3). During the Medieval Warm Period and the Modern Warm Period, drought conditions prevailed in East Africa. But wet conditions ruled during the Little Ice Age. We also know that this climatic behavior over decades and centuries happens to follow solar activity. Thus moisture development in East Africa is mainly driven by solar activity.
Unfortunately the authors of this Nature study “forgot” to mention it – even though it’s made obvious by the data. The results are no surprise because numerous other studies from different parts across the world show the same distinct patterns, for example: here, here, here, and here, just to name a few from many.

==================================
“It’s getting colder because it’s getting warmer” – The meteorological illusory world of the climate alarmists
By meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls
European Institute for Climate and Energy
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Cartoon right: www.cartoonsbyjosh.com
For more than 10 years Germany and large parts of Europe have been seeing a trend to colder winters with considerable phases of snow and cold, especially over the last five winters. This is in stark contradiction to the established climate science. For example in 2000 we heard from IPCC climate scientist and lead author Mojib Latif: “Winters with strong frost and lots of snow like what we saw 20 years ago will no longer exist at our latitudes”.
Today in 2013 we are seeing harsher winters persisting until the end of March! This is an embarrassing calamity for German climate alarmists, who 2 years began concocting a meteorologically adventurous hypothesis in an attempt save face. The alarmists:
“The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research now sees the harsh winters as being a consequence of global warming, which now causes icy winds in the Arctic to find their way unobstructed to Europe because of climate change.”

Let’s look at the facts.
The winters in northern and central Europe have been cooling for more than 10 years, Fig. 1:

Fig. 1: Germany’s temperature anomaly trend for (DJF) winters over the last 16 years shows a cooling of 2°C. Chart source: EIKE (Josef Kowatsch), data from the German Weather Service (DWD).
This cooling trend is also observed in the mean annual temperature values, globally (stagnation) [2], as well as in Germany:

Fig. 2: Germany’s mean temperature trend has been falling sharply over the last 15 years. (Source Josef Kowatsch, data from German Weather Service).
The climate models had predicted nothing of the sort. Especially embarrassing is that 10 years ago we heard in interviews with leading climate scientists and read statements like the following [3]:
“Good-bye winter: Never again snow? In Germany cold winters are a thing of the past.”
Today nature is contradicting the model projections for annual and wintertime temperatures. And now, after the fact, the alarmists are busy concocting dubious explanations. The Alfred Wegener Institute [4]:
The model calculations show that atmospheric pressure difference is weakened by minimal Arctic sea ice cover later on in the winter and thus cause the Arctic cold to move all the way down to middle latitudes.”
From a meteorological standpoint, there’s a lot to be said about that:
(1) Proof that winter weather in one region can be derived from the earlier summertime weather of another region has yet to be found by the generations of meteorology! If it were the case, the problems of longer-term seasonal forecasts would be finally solved.
Even the climate alarmists are publicly skeptical of their new “silver bullet” science, and deeply so. Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) scientist Ralf Jaiser added: “Of course a great number of other factors play a role in our complex climate system that at times overlap each other. […] Other mechanisms are for example related to snow cover in Siberia or to tropical influences. The interrelationships between these factors of influence are subjects of future research work and thus remain factors of uncertainty for forecasts.“
PIK scientist Gerstengarbe also added [5]:
The studies of this development are ongoing, and so at the moment no conclusions can be made on whether or not Central Europe will have the ‘pleasure’ of cold easterly winds more frequently.”
In a nutshell, nobody knows anything for sure. Yet, the chattering elite media now have more climate-catastrophe fodder for their dependably gullible readers, at least through Easter.
(2) If the new alarmist hypothesis were conclusive, then we should have seen mostly cold winters for the last 20 years, because this is a time period where we have seen relatively little Arctic sea ice cover in the summertime (see Fig. 3):

Fig. 3: Arctic sea ice area, [6].
However, we only have seen a higher frequency of cold, snowy winters only over the last five years.
Here the alarmists are playing it on the safe side and are not mentioning one certain aspect: After the annual summertime minimum, the ice area always recovers over the following winter (Fig. 3) and reaches the long-term mean value (currently it is slightly above normal). Lots of ice “generates” lots of cold air, which at times plunges down into Central Europe due to the stochastic cycles of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). And sometimes it does not (see Fig. 4). To this day there is no correlation whatsoever between NAO with CO2.
Our winter weather is still always made in the winter, and there is absolutely no evidence for claims to the contrary!
(3) The decisive argument against the new “Warm-Cold-Hypothesis” is as follows:
If this hypothesis were scientifically, or at least statistically conclusive, then the NAO index (air pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores) over the last 30 years would have been negative for the most part. However, the exact opposite is the case, see Fig. 4:

Figure 4: NAO Index. Positive index leads to warmer European winters (westerly winds), negative index to colder winters (blocking).
NAO Index 1982 – 2012
 Positive: 22
 Negative: 7
 Neutral: 1
Over the last 5 years we’ve had cold winter-phases with snow and blasts of cold air when the NAO index was positive as a whole. Thus, in contradiction to the claims of the climate alarmists, the cold air of this winter, as was the case in the last winters, did not come at all from the north from (the Arctic), but rather mainly from the icy east winds from Russia and Southern Scandinavia.
That alone suffices to refute the crude claim: “Our winters are getting colder because the summers in the Arctic are geting warmer.”
The Weltwoche [8] from Zurich quotes PIK scientist Stefan Rahmstorf: “The ice free areas of the oceans act like heaters as the water there is warmer than the Arctic air above. This produces more ideal conditions for high pressure systems that steer cold air to Europe.”
This completely contradicts meteorological and textbook knowledge: High pressure systems are not created above warm water – low pressure systems are. Classic examples are tropical storms.
Moreover, the Arctic is not made up of ice-free areas, but of ICE. This is true today (Fig. 3).
Again quoting Stefan Rahmstorf: . “…oceans act like heaters because the water there is warmer than the Arctic air above.. This produces more ideal conditions for a high pressure system…” The exact contrary is stated in meteorological textbooks:
The wintertime static cold highs form above cold, snow-covered ground. A classic example are the annual(!) wintertime cold highs over Siberia and Russia.”
In other words: Such a high cannot form over “warm” Arctic water. Exception: it occurs dynamically through convergences in planetary waves in the middle atmosphere. But such highs are, as a rule, not very stationary. Moreover, the (more seldom) thermically static highs on the other hand are very much so. This 2012/13 winter proves it with its constantly re-generating cold highs over Scandinavia Russia, which went on for months.
In the meantime some media outlets [9] have begun to notice that the explanations on these developments coming from the established climate science institutes are in stark contradiction to their models, and have appeared after the fact:
“…are three cold winters…coincidental?” … “Such winters are incomnvenient not only for those who freeze in the, but also for those who earlier projected warmer temperatures because of CO2 emissions.” … “The reality is, writes American climate scientist JUDAH COHEN, that we are freezing not despite climate change but because of it” … “But such an explanation would be convincing if it had not come after the fact. Instead the exact opposite had been announced for decades.”
Some media outlets are becoming distrustful as a result of these contradictory claims, as the following headlines show:
“Climate prognoses under scrutiny; extreme cold in March: Is global warming leading the a new ice age?” [10], or:
“Wissenschaftler warnen vor Eiszeit” [11]
We’ll have to wait and see. But in the meantime, it looks like global warming is over! [12]

"Over recent decades, scientists have watched the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions respond in starkly different and perhaps surprising ways to the effects of increasing human influence on the Earth’s climate.  Whereas the Arctic has warmed far more than any other region and has steadily lost sea ice, Antarctica has cooled in most places and gained sea ice. Any hope of predicting the fate of these environmentally critical regions rests on understanding the elemental processes behind this polar climate conundrum. In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society journal we lay out a framework for the response of polar environments to the effects of human-induced changes to the climate. The predominant factors are the ever-increasing concentration of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere and the ozone hole over Antarctica caused by an abundance of chlorofluorocarbons, which peaked at the turn of the century and are now slowly diminishing. On account of its ability to absorb and transport enormous amounts of heat, the ocean also plays an outsized role in climate change and is an important factor in the explaining the asymmetric response of the north and south poles to the changing climate.  In our computer simulations of the ocean and climate, the excess heat from greenhouse gases is absorbed into the ocean around Antarctica and in the North Atlantic. The heat does not stay in place but instead is carried around by the moving ocean. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, currents draw heat towards the equator, away from the pole.  Meanwhile in the North Atlantic, ocean currents carry excess heat poleward towards the Arctic. So while Antarctica warms little, or even cools, the Arctic Ocean’s temperature increases to such an extent that heat is actually lost to the atmosphere over the Arctic. This clearly reveals the differing responses to greenhouse gases in each region, with the Arctic warming more than twice as rapidly as the Antarctic. By mid-century, the Arctic may have warmed so much that summers could have no sea ice at all. As for the ozone hole over Antarctica, scientists have only recently started to quantify the impact of ozone depletion and recovery on the surface climate. When we introduced an ozone hole into our model, the winds over the Southern Ocean grew faster. This intensification of winds initially triggers a rapid cooling of the sea surface and expansion of sea ice, but this is followed by a slow process of warming and sea ice contraction. We think this warming happens because the stronger winds eventually dredge up to the surface warm waters from the deep ocean.  Our calculations suggest that around Antarctica the ozone hole may have delayed warming due to greenhouse gases by several decades. It’s tempting to speculate that this is the period through which we now find ourselves passing. By mid-century, however, ozone hole-effects may instead be adding to the warming around Antarctica, but with diminished amplitude as the ozone hole heals. When we bring our results together, an interesting picture emerges of the combined effect of greenhouse gases and the effects of the ozone hole on climate at the poles. It may be that the slight cooling currently measured around Antarctica today is a consequence of the cooling effects of the ozone hole. But as the century proceeds, both these human-induced effects on the climate may combine with the effect of warming waters around Antarctica with worrying but uncertain effects on Antarctic sea ice, glaciers and sea-level rise."

This is a response to the article posted by Dr. Ryan Maue here titled: CEI misses the boat on the need for the National Weather Service.  Ryan’s response is in the comments, and here is the key clause:
…The CEI should think about their statement about the “private collection” and ownership of weather data. How did that work for the UK Met-Office + Hadley Center with Phil Jones’ climate data? (climate data is weather data, btw)

By Iain Murray and David Bier
The most difficult task free-market advocates often face is in addressing the duties the government has already assumed.  Who will provide education?  Who will deliver the mail?  Who will coordinate airline flights? The knee-jerk reaction is generally that it is too difficult for the private sector to provide these services. Our recent op-ed [“Do We Really Need a National Weather Service?”], in which we argued that the private sector could provide the services provided by the National Weather Service (NWS), met precisely that reaction.

Each response seemed to conclude that we wanted the NWS’ services to disappear.  That is analogous to saying that advocates of privatizing the U.S. Postal Service want to end mail delivery. Or that proponents (like CEI) of Federal Aviation Administration privatization want to end air traffic control.  Such a suggestion would indeed be “laughable,” as some critics put it, but we never suggested that.
Therefore, most of the responses simply attacked a straw man. On reflection, we should have been more explicit that we were calling for the privatization of the government’s civilian weather services, not their outright abolition. Our piece was too easy to misinterpret.
Nearly all the responses dismissed the notion that the services of the NWS could be provided privately.  Yet Britain’s Meteorological Office is already a self-funding, commercial entity, and the British government is now considering selling it to a private corporation, much as the Canadian government sold its air traffic control (ATC) service to the now award-winning NavCanada.
Private weather services often rely on NWS data. But we repeat that no one (to our knowledge) wants to shut down NWS services. The existence of many private weather agencies demonstrates a significant demand for this information, and the fact that they do more with the data and provide even more accurate forecasts strongly suggests that private entities would improve on the data collection functions the NWS currently provides. There is no intrinsic reason why the infrastructure for this data collection function should be publicly owned. Our critics have advanced none, other than the fact that it is currently publicly owned.
Historically, privatization has led to more investment in a service or industry, not less. For example, the privatization of water utilities in Britain almost doubled investment in that vital service — and increased quality, as well. The UK Laboratory of the Government Chemist has seen a fivefold increase in its number of staff since privatization.
Some responses discussed NOAA, the agency that oversees the NWS, and other government agencies which were not referenced in our piece. To be clear, we do not envision private planes replacing all military reconnaissance flights, as some (including Dr. Maue) suggested, but military data collection is not incompatible with a NWS privatization plan.  The private sector owners could – and perhaps should – pay the military for the information.
Some have argued that the private sector could not afford to purchase the assets of the NWS. If that is the case(and we doubt it is), then the NWS can be sold as either one or a number of companies via IPO.
Either way, the sale of the NWS would bring in substantial revenue for the government at a time we are told it needs it most. At the very least, the NWS should begin to operate as a Performance-Based Organization, charging for its services. That will allow private companies to decide whether or not they are receiving value for money. If they are not, we will see more competition, and therefore increased accuracy, in data collection.
Even when the government stands in the way by means of regulation, that is advanced as justification for more government.  Accuweather’s Mike Smith argues that, “[C]urrent federal policy (set by the FCC) will not allow private sector companies to run 10cm weather radars. For technical reasons, 10cm are vital in measuring precipitation. We must have a federal entity for that.” Why? The reason for the ban is unclear, but if the NWS already gets an exception to FCC rules, a private competitor could be granted one as well.  If there are genuine national security or interference issues, then a rigorous licensing procedure respecting those concerns should suffice.
It may surprise some to learn that privatization is not new to the NWS. Over the years, the Service has divested such programs as direct commercial radio and television broadcasts, newspaper weather page preparation, agricultural forecasts, and the fire weather service. The latter two were privatized as recently as the mid-1990s. In each case, government officials simply decided that government had no real business providing the service. Our suggestion simply follows that logic.
The arguments against privatization focus on the role the government already plays, as if the service would disappear otherwise.  This flawed logic is trotted whenever government monopolies are criticized. The National Weather Service is not exceptional.  If people demand weather forecasts and advisories, and government gets out of the business, the market will provide.
Iain Murray is Vice President at the Competitive Enterprise Institute with considerable experience in privatization. David Bier is a Research Associate at CEI.

"As delegates gather once again for climate talks in Bonn, the question has to be asked: after decades of conferences, committees, procedures and protocols, is the multilateral approach to tackling climate change working? What alternative routes are there that would lead to more action with less discussion? Are unilateral measures – where states take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without international agreements – so far-fetched? One measure that could have an effect if enacted by economic superpowers such as the US or the European Union is a carbon consumption tax. This is one of several progressive ideas to be presented at the congress Global Challenges: Achieving Sustainability taking place in October in Copenhagen. A carbon consumption tax, even if introduced by the EU and the US, would be a unilateral measure in the sense that it does not emerge from an organised collective international organisation such as the UNFCCC (the UN climate change body), but rather from the choices of individual states. Unilateral measures are usually considered to be “politically correct” if building on existing efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But the carbon consumption tax we propose would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide – action deemed less politically correct as it is deliberately aimed at affecting behaviour in other states. As a tax on products, it would be a trade measure and would consequently have to be designed to legally conform with World Trade Organisation rules in order to survive potential legal challenges. Some states might even reject such initiatives simply because they originate from the US or EU. Despite its own complications, unilateralism seems more appealing than multilateralism if the latter fails to deliver results on issues of great importance to future generations. While it may be seen as politically incorrect even to propose such an idea, it could be the only pragmatic and viable solution to today’s global challenges. A carbon consumption tax would effectively curb greenhouse gas emissions in all countries that want to export their goods to countries that impose it. For a long time such proposals have been seen as some type of “eco-imperialism”, or economic protectionism designed to keep developing countries from access to markets for their products. But the harsh reality of today’s climate challenges may be sufficient to change that view.  First, exporting is entirely voluntary – if countries can find other trading partners with less stringent requirements they are welcome to take their products elsewhere. Second, developing countries – such as China – are themselves beginning to take their own steps to curb pollution because their environmental problems are becoming too large. So a consumption tax may prompt investment in modernised production lines and manufacturing processes, with the subsequent effect of also improving working conditions, which in many developing countries is a cause for concern. But a consumption tax implemented by the EU and US would go further, effectively assigning responsibility for climate change. Under the  UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, developing countries were not subject to any restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. The language of the agreements refer to “common but differentiated responsibilities”, without further explanation. This leads to a situation where developed countries are faced with environmental measures that are too costly to implement if competing economies in the developing world are not required to do the same. A carbon consumption tax, however, would change the locus of regulation from production to end consumption or use. For example, about a third of China’s greenhouse gas emissions are accounted for by goods exported for use or consumption elsewhere. Shifting the burden from production to consumption would completely reconfigure the current impact on climate change action (or inaction), and if there is still any hope for a legally binding post-Kyoto Protocol with hard targets for at least some countries, this may be as good a time as any to do so. When analysing the responsibility for climate change, it’s important to note that it is inherently a global problem and part of mankind’s common concern. Emissions from a country such as Denmark affects all other countries just as much as those from China or Britain or the US, and so are of equal interest to all people from all nations. Why not adopt a legislative framework that puts the burden on the consumer, rather than require nations to enforce against the producer? Decades of enforcing the “polluter pays principle” on a global scale has led to inefficient rules that have produced little, if any, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as few countries are willing to shoulder the additional costs."

Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right, here I am _Stuff_ ed in the middle with you.



The only good thing about this latest piece of climate emergency idiocy is that the writer keeps talking about ‘global warming’.



The official figures say that the trend since December 1978 is 0.13C/decade. So in the four decades that the global warming scam has been running, the temperature has risen 0.52C.



This humungous rise in temperature is threatening our native birds.



Native birds are being forced to live in shrinking high-altitude habitats by the double whammy of a climate change “thermal squeeze” and marauding predators at lower levels.



The latest study by three Manaaki Whenua-Landcare Research scientists shows expanding populations of rats, stoats and possums in birds’ lower-level, warmer, environments, along with lowland forest loss, are effectively shrinking bird habitats to less ideal, higher-elevation and cold environments.



Using the findings of the New Zealand Ornithological Society’s bird atlases for the 1969-1979 and 1999-2004 periods, the researchers found the birds most endangered by the thermal squeeze are the larger bodied and often already rare species, such as kiwi, whio, weka and kakako. […]



Kiwi are found from Northland to Fiordland. Weka are found on Kawau Island in the north and Stewart Island in the south. Without access to detailed temperature records it would seem a safe bet that the typical temperatures in these places differ by more than 0.5C. 



There are two factors mentioned. One, predators, is a real threat; the second, global warming (aka thermal squeeze) is a nonsense designed to get headlines and funding. 



“ **The answer is going to be predator management** on a large scale.”



Forest & Bird spokesman Geoff Keey said the findings were bad news for forest birds, especially kiwi, kaka and whio.



“The situation is likely to worsen with climate change, which will reduce the extent of cooler refuges where predator numbers are lower for much of the time. […]



  
However, there is good news on the horizon. Even the great warmist, NASA, is agreeing that we are entering another period of cooling due to the solar cycles and sunspot activity. Temperatures a likely to be 1C cooler through the next cooling period until around 2050.



We can cross one concern off the list and just get on with predator control.

The ‘transformational’ government of the coalition has taken some heavy, self-inflicted hits including the inability to institute a capital gains tax, dropping the Kermadec Island sanctuary, walking back Kiwibuild housing numbers, ousting Curran and Whaitiri and loss of business confidence to name a few. 



The most consequential back-down, however, has gone almost unnoticed. Maybe the MSM just didn’t want to give it any focus as they were obviously big supporters. It involves **a commitment to 100% renewable electricity in New Zealand by 2035,** agreed shortly after the 2017 general election between the Labour and Green parties. The policy is in their agreement on confidence and supply.



Late in 2017, Cabinet agreed to set up an interim committee to plan the policy of delivering 100% renewables also **establishing a permanent Climate Change Commission** , another item in the Coalition agreement.



Shock, horror, the committee came back with a recommendation to drop the 100% renewables policy by 2035. The Coalition had little option but to agree. In one fell swoop, a huge hole had been blown in the Coalition’s plans. James Shaw had a mouthful of dead rats, yet again. The Greens took a sucker punch. One of their dearest goals just went ‘poof’ in a haze of CO2.



The “for the public” explanation was that the policy would have increased power prices but done little to reduce emissions.



The reality is that it was a green, wet dream. It would have seriously hurt those on low incomes by sending power prices through the roof and wrecked the viability and competitiveness of our export industries who rely heavily on our relatively low-cost hydroelectric power generation to market their goods offshore. It would have created endless blackouts causing havoc for homes, businesses, urban motorists etc and filled the skyline with more obscene wind machines that kill birds and produce damaging low-frequency sounds. Ironically it would have also had us opening new coal mines to fill the gaps when it is dark, cold and the wind stops.



The country has dodged a bullet. Beware though as there are others in the gun’s chamber like the Emissions Bill going through the house now. 



The hit on the coalition demands more scrutiny. Of course, we are unable to have a discussion in the MSM – a draconian and sinister misuse of editorial power – so few in the public will see it for what it is – **a significant back-down** and damage to the extreme green policies of the red, left-leaning Greens and Labour.



The scrutiny would show that much of the environmental policy of the coalition is wishful thinking. It’s ideology. It’s trumped-up, airy-fairy nonsense that has no basis in sound reputable science or logic. Nor does it have a place in policymaking.



It’s based on manipulated graphs that turned cooling temperatures into warming temperatures using hidden or distorted data. It’s based on models produced by geeks that cannot agree between themselves and that in 20 years or so have plotted temperatures so far above actual it’s laughable. 



It’s based on a ‘hockey stick’ graph that emerged from one scientist studying the growth rings in half a dozen spruce trees in Siberia and ignoring decades of research into ice cores from multiple international sites that show a medieval warm period hotter than it is now. (Note: It is Greenland, not Whiteland) 



It’s based on fictitious claims of hot days, record temperatures, hottest months, warmest years when in many countries temperatures in the 1930s were several degrees hotter. It’s based on a politician’s movie that contained 35 proven factual errors but won him a handsome bank balance and a share of a Nobel Peace Prize. 



It’s based on striking terror into people’s lives, especially the young and vulnerable with wild stories of sea-level rise swamping islands and cities, horror tales of increasing storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, floods, rain events when all the factual data shows the weather improving over 100 years of records.



It’s also based on the work of pseudo-scientists, who do no original, on the ground research but feed off the most recent outlandish claim and try and better it. It is Ponzi-science. 



When you have few facts to back your claims you show an emaciated, scraggy polar bear perched on a melting blob of ice and claim that proves the end of those sweet, cuddly species – a symbol of a doomed civilisation. No matter that their numbers are increasing to a point where a controlled reduction is discussed because the bears are over-running some areas.



 **You cannot build a house on the sand and expect it to last.** You cannot build policy on corrupt ideology and falsified science and expect it to perform.



Fortunately the appointed committee told it the way it was – they really didn’t have an option. The goal of all renewables by 2035 according to the PM is now ‘aspirational’. Hopefully, it will become ‘expirational’.

"Airlines in Europe have applied for €12.8bn (£11.3bn) government support since the start of the coronavirus pandemic with no binding environmental conditions attached, according to an analysis of the sector’s bailout pleas. By Tuesday this week, airlines including easyJet, Scandinavian Airlines and Tui had secured loans and other financial support amounting to €3.36bn. A further €9.47bn is being sought by other airlines, data tracking by Transport & Environment, Greenpeace and Carbon Watch reveals. By the time air travel came to a near halt in March, greenhouse gas emissions from the sector had reached record levels. But there are no binding environmental conditions being attached to any of the already agreed bailouts or future loans being sought. The exception is in Austria, where the transport minister, Leonore Gewessler, responded to a request for public support by Austrian Airlines (part of the Lufthansa group) by saying any bailout should be linked to climate targets. The amounts being negotiated for bailout plans and recapitalisation are likely to increase as talks continue with some of the biggest European airlines, including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and Alitalia. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  In the UK, Virgin’s Richard Branson has come under fire for seeking a £565m bailout from the government. He has been told to explore other ways of getting cash before seeking state aid but environmental conditions have not been at the forefront of government comments on the bailout plea. EasyJet, which has secured a £600m emergency loan from the UK government, emitted 4.1% more CO2 in 2019 than in 2018. Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager for Transport & Environment, said: “Airlines are seeking public money so they can get back to the business-as-usual of soaring emissions enabled by light-touch pollution laws and tax exemptions. “It’s time to ensure that aviation makes a green transition by linking aid to taxes and greener fuels which will reverse the sector’s rapid emissions growth.” Aviation is one of the fastest growing contributors to greenhouse gas emissions over the past 20 years. In the last five years there has been a 26% rise in GHG emissions from aviation. Last year, Ryanair joined coal plants as one of Europe’s top 10 polluters after increasing its emissions on flights within the continent by 5.9%. A global scheme run by the UN to offset aviation emissions that grow above 2020 levels, known as Corsia, began this year, but airlines are  seeking delays and changes to it as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The analysis published on Wednesday reveals that five of the airlines seeking or receiving state aid as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic have earned more than €1bn in net profits in the past five years. These include IAG, which owns British Airways (€9.37bn profit), Lufthansa group (€8.17bn), Tui group (€3.09bn), easyJet (€2.39bn) and Air France-KLM (€1.05bn). Airlines do not pay fuel taxes or VAT on flights. Faiza Oulahsen, from Greenpeace EU, said: “Public bailouts must come with strict conditions to protect jobs and slash the aviation sector’s soaring contribution to climate breakdown. “Any public funding should lay the foundation for a just and green transition for people and planet, with widespread investment in transport alternatives like trains. Governments must address both the economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis and the crisis we face in climate change.”"

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
On Monday of this week, three prominent and influential scientists published an opinion piece in _Politico_ arguing that anthropogenic global warming was responsible for making the destruction from “super storm” Sandy significantly worse than it otherwise would have been. They added that if we don’t “cut industrial carbon pollution,” we are going to get more of the same, and then some.   
  
On the same day, I argued here at Cato@Liberty that it could be reasoned that anthropogenic global warming _lessened_ the impact of Sandy.   
  
The scientific truth about the situation is that it is impossible to know who is right---the uncertainties are just too large. But I think it is fair to say that no matter what direction the influence of anthropogenic global warming was on Sandy, in net it was quite small.   
  
One difference between my piece and the _Politico_ article co-signed by Dr. Robert Corell (“senior policy fellow for the American Meteorological Society and former Chair of the United States Global Change Research Program”), Dr. Jeff Masters (""the founder and Director of Meteorology for Weather Underground and a former NOAA Hurricane Hunter"") and Dr. Kevin Trenberth (“Distinguished Senior Scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research"") was that I tried to stick to a scientifically defensible argument. In their piece, they juiced up their case with some---how should I say this?---rather dubious facts.   
  
The worst of these was claiming that “[o]n the stretch of the Atlantic Coast that spans from Norfolk to Boston, sea levels have been rising four times faster than the global average.” They implied that anthropogenic global warming was the reason why.   
  
This is simply untrue.   
  
While it is true that the long-term (~20th century) rate of sea level rise along that stretch has been about twice the global average over the same period, it is scientifically well-established that the regional enhanced rate of sea level rise is due to ongoing geologic processes resulting from end of the last ice age. When these non-anthropogenic processes are properly subtracted out of the tide gauge record of sea level observations, the rate of sea level rise that is left over is virtually the same as the global rate of rise, not four times faster.   




The same conclusion is reached if you limit your comparison to the period of satellite observations of sea level, which began about 20 years ago. The figure below shows a map of the satellite-measured trends in sea level from 1993 through mid-2012. The global average rate of rise is 0.12 inches per year, which is represented by a sort of greenish yellow color. Turning your attention to the Northeast coast of the United States (you might have to squint a bit), you see that the color there is also sort of greenish yellow—in other words, right about the global average. Places where the sea level is rising four times faster than the global average are colored a light pink; while there are a few such places, none of them are anywhere near the stretch of coast between Norfolk and Boston.   






Figure 1. Spatial distribution of the rate of sea level rise across the globe as measured by satellite altimeters (Source: University of Colorado Sea Level Group, modified to reflect English units).   
  
It is somewhat telling when prominent climate scientists have to resort to incorporating incorrect (and readily debunked) science to try to bolster their case for climate alarm---an alarm that was raised to try to scare us into accepting regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

Heathrow airport. Image via Wikipedia

OK, bad pun, but I could not resist.
From the National Center for Atmospheric Research/University Corporation for Atmospheric Research  something related to what we have always said, airports are not a representative environment for climate measurement.
Takeoffs and landings cause more precipitation near airports
BOULDER–Researchers have found that areas near commercial airports sometimes experience a small but measurable increase in rain and snow when aircraft take off and land under certain atmospheric conditions.
The new study led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is part of ongoing research that focuses on so-called hole punch and canal clouds that form when planes fly through certain mid-level clouds, forcing nearby air to rapidly expand and cool. This causes water droplets to freeze to ice and then turn to snow as they fall toward the ground, leaving behind odd-shaped gaps in the clouds.

The research team used satellite images and weather forecasting computer models to examine how often this type of inadvertent cloud seeding may occur within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of six commercial airports: London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Charles De Gaulle (Paris), Seattle-Tacoma, O’Hare (Chicago), and Yellowknife (Northwest Territories, Canada), as well as Byrd Station in Antarctica. They found that, depending on the airport and type of plane, the right atmospheric conditions typically exist up to 6 percent of the time, with somewhat more frequency in colder climates.
The lead author, NCAR scientist Andrew Heymsfield, says this phenomenon likely occurs at numerous other airports, especially in mid- and high-latitude areas during colder months. The key variable is whether there are cloud layers in the vicinity that contain water droplets at temperatures far below freezing, which is a common occurrence.
He adds that more research is needed before scientists can determine whether the precipitation produced by this effect is significant. The inadvertent cloud seeding may increase the need to de-ice planes more often, he adds.
“It appears to be a rather widespread effect for aircraft to inadvertently cause some measureable amount of rain or snow as they fly through certain clouds,” Heymsfield says. “This is not necessarily enough precipitation to affect global climate, but it is noticeable around major airports in the midlatitudes.”
The researchers did not estimate the total amount of rain or snow that would result from such inadvertent cloud seeding. However, they analyzed radar readings that, in one case, indicated a snowfall rate of close to an inch an hour after several planes had passed through.
The study is being published this week in the journal Science. Researchers from NASA Langley Research Center and the University of Wyoming, Laramie, co-authored the paper. Funding came from the National Science Foundation, which is NCAR’s sponsor, and from NASA.
Solving a cloud mystery
Scientists for decades have speculated about the origins of mysterious holes and canals in clouds. Heymsfield led a study last year establishing that the gaps, which sometimes look as though a giant hole punch was applied to a cloud, are caused when aircraft fly through midlevel clouds that contain supercooled droplets.
When a turboprop plane flies through such a cloud layer with temperatures about 5 degrees Fahrenheit or lower (about -15 degrees Celsius or lower), the tips of its propellers can cause the air to rapidly expand. As the air expands, it cools and causes the supercooled droplets to freeze into ice particles that evaporate the droplets and grow, falling out of the clouds as snow or rain.
Jet aircraft need colder temperatures (below about -4 to -13 degrees F, or -20 to -25 degrees C) to generate the seeding effect. Air forced to expand over the wings as the aircraft moves forward cools and freezes the cloud droplets.
The effect is unrelated to the trails of condensed water vapor known as contrails made by the exhaust of jet engines.
In the new research, the study team used cloud measurements taken by the NASA CALIPSO satellite to quantify how often such conditions exist within about 62 miles of several airports located in relatively cloudy areas. They chose the 62-mile radius because that is approximately the distance it takes for a commercial aircraft to climb above about 10,000 feet, where many of the supercooled cloud layers are located.
Of the major, mid-latitude airports studied, they found that the Frankfurt, DeGaulle, and O’Hare airports most frequently experienced the right conditions for propeller aircraft to generate precipitation. In each case, the conditions existed more than 5 percent of the time over the course of a year. The researchers found that the right conditions existed more than 3 percent of the time for jets at Heathrow, Frankfurt, and Seattle-Tacoma.
Yellowknife experienced such conditions more often, about 10 percent of the time for propeller planes and 5 percent for jets, presumably because of colder cloud conditions at higher latitudes. Byrd often experienced the very cold conditions that enable jets to cause inadvertent cloud seeding.
The researchers also found that a diverse range of aircraft can induce precipitation. By comparing observations of hole-punch and canal clouds made by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite with flight path records from the Federal Aviation Administration, they confirmed that commercial jets (such as Boeing 757s and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series of jets), military aircraft (B-52s), various regional and private jets, turboprops, and prop/piston planes all can induce precipitation.
Hole-Punch Cloud
Aircraft-induced hole observed at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Camp, Antarctica (79 28.058 °S 112 05.189 °W, 1806 m elevation) on Dec. 12, 2009, 1400 New Zealand Time. The cloud's bright cumuliform structure with gray fallstreaks below are visible. The hole first appeared on the horizon and then moved toward the camera. It is likely that a LC130 aircraft produced the ice that formed the hole. Photo provided by Eric Zrubek and Michael Carmody. For more information, please see Figure 1A in the manuscript.

“It appears that virtually any airplane that flies through clouds containing liquid water at temperatures much below freezing can cause this effect,” Heymsfield says.
Satellite readings analyzed by the team showed that holes and canals generated by aircraft can occur with some frequency. For example, an extensive cloud layer over Texas on January 29, 2007, contained 92 such gaps, some of which persisted for more than four hours and reached lengths of 60 miles or more.
Heymsfield and his colleagues also used a powerful software tool, known as the Weather and Research Forecasting model, to learn more about how the holes form and develop. They found that the hole rapidly spreads about 30 to 90 minutes after an aircraft passes through. This would be the peak time for precipitation associated with the cloud-seeding effect. After about 90 minutes, ice and snow begin to dissipate.

A nasty spat has erupted between Washington and Beijing over the Obama administration’s arms sales to Taiwan. As soon as the US made the official announcement of the US$6.4 billion package last Friday, Beijing responded with both harsh words and retaliatory measures. Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei called in US Ambassador Jon Huntsman for a dressing down. Beijing also suspended scheduled military exchange programs and threatened to impose sanctions against any American company involved in the production or distribution of weapons destined for Taiwan.



The conventional wisdom in the United States is that this episode is no big deal. Those who take a relaxed view contend that China’s reaction is in line with its response to previous arms sales. The new brouhaha, the reasoning goes, will subside and relations will soon return to normal.



Perhaps. But the arms sale showdown is just the latest in a series of incidents stoking tensions between China and the US. Those tensions encompass economic, diplomatic and security disputes.



Even before the Obama administration took office, US officials complained about a variety of practices that they believed gave China an unfair advantage in the global economic arena. Those ranged from an undervalued currency to import dumping and arbitrary exclusion of American products from China’s domestic market. President Barack Obama’s decision to impose punitive tariffs on imported Chinese tires last summer was a signal that US patience was wearing thin.



The annoyance is not confined to trade matters. Washington has long prodded Beijing to take a firmer stance against the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and especially show a willingness to back more robust economic sanctions against those two countries.



Administration leaders hoped that the summit meetings with President Hu Jintao during Obama’s visit to China would lead to progress on Washington’s grievances. That did not happen. Not only did Chinese leaders largely rebuff the president’s requests for policy changes, there was a widespread perception in the US that the Chinese treated Obama with a dismissive attitude that bordered on disdain.



That treatment created a propaganda bonanza for Obama’s domestic political opponents. Critics excoriated him for “kowtowing” to the Chinese and argued that the China summit confirmed that Obama is a diplomatic lightweight who is incapable of defending important American interests. Most telling, his staunch defenders were few and far between regarding his performance in Beijing.



China’s unwillingness to back serious carbon‐​emissions reduction measures at the Copenhagen climate change summit did not help relations with Washington. Once again the Chinese seemed to defy the Obama administration on a high‐​priority US goal.



But Beijing has its own grievances with the US. Chinese officials have expressed both veiled and explicit complaints about the huge and growing US federal budget deficits. In their view, Washington’s profligate fiscal practices threaten to trigger an inflationary spiral that would undermine the value of China’s vast dollar holdings.



Chinese leaders also grow weary of Washington’s lectures about the need to get tough with North Korea and Iran. In Beijing’s view, America’s stubborn unwillingness to address the wider security concerns of those countries is at least as responsible as the recalcitrant attitude of the two regimes for the lack of progress on the nuclear issue. Moreover, officials believe that China is being asked to take measures that would undermine vital Chinese interests. They regard North Korea as an important security buffer and Iran as a crucial energy supplier, so are extremely reluctant to antagonize either regime. The announcement of the Taiwan arms sale, coming on the heels of US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s harsh comment earlier the same day that China risked “isolation” within the international community if it did not endorse more robust sanctions against Iran, may have been the last straw for Beijing.



Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the Foreign Ministry’s response to the arms sale contained one element that departed from previous reactions. China had never before sought to sanction US firms for such transactions. That threat was a significant escalation and seemed contrary to Beijing’s obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization. One can hope that the conventional wisdom is right and that the latest dispute will soon fade.



But the bulk of the evidence suggests that storm clouds are building in the US‐​China relationship.



The world’s largest economy and its soon‐​to‐​be‐​main rival are not likely to become overt adversaries anytime soon, but there is a noticeable chill in the air.

"The Chelsea Flower Show is in full bloom. The UK’s annual botanical extravaganza celebrates all aspects of horticulture and is an important venue for watching emerging trends in the gardening world. But how can we maximise the green spaces we have to hand and also benefit the environment? In the UK, domestic gardens represent 20-25% of a city’s area and the vast majority of urban residents have access to one. What we grow in these green spaces and –- importantly – how they are managed, could have a significant environmental impact within our cities. There are a number of ways that plants and gardens provide positive and negative “services”. For example, scientists are confident that plants provide localised cooling, decrease the risk of flooding and support biodiversity. They are also confident about the risks and the extent of potential damage from using peat, chemicals and fertilisers in plant management. It is therefore critical that we use this knowledge to maximise the positive impact of our green spaces. Much as different management practices have a smaller or greater environmental impact, plants themselves can differ a huge amount in the different benefits (and costs) that they entail and provide.  In a recent study focusing on the cooling service provided by green roofs, our Royal Horticultural Society science team found that broad-leaved plants cooled their own and surrounding surfaces better than the traditionally used succulent plants. This is because the broad and thin-leaved plants use and lose more water than thicker-leaved succulents, cooling better through the process of transpiration. In our outdoor experiments, on a hot sunny summer day this led to broad-leaved Stachys byzantina (Lamb’s Ear) cooling the soil (and so potentially a roof surface if planted there) by a huge 12°C more than a covering of succulent Sedum.  Plants can capture and temporarily hold pollution particles from the air (such as from fuel burning and vehicular emissions); they can also take up gaseous pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Research suggests that plants with complex leaf structures (including rough, hairy leaves) are likely to be capturing more pollutants across the range of particle sizes.  Conifers such as Leylands and pines have been shown to accumulate more particles (in the size ranges greater than 2.5μm) on their surfaces than broad-leaved tree species such as poplars, maples or whitebeams. But both broad-leaved and conifer species have been shown to accumulate well the finest particles (less than 1μm), potentially most detrimental to human health. So, growing longer-life, perennial plants such as trees and shrubs in our gardens will help decrease our carbon impact, enabling longer-term carbon storage in the plants and the soil. There are some simple and effective steps you can take in your own garden to maximise the positive environmental contribution of your green spaces, decrease the risk of surface flooding, insulate your house using vegetation and support biodiversity. Plant climbers and wall shrubs Most of us have walls and fences that have space for a climber or wall shrub. Using these leafy coverings helps insulate homes in winter (reducing heating bills) and keeps them cooler in summer. You can even go up the wall with plants by installing green-wall planting systems.  Grow plants for wildlife When it comes to encouraging wildlife, it’s a case of the more plants the better. Aim to grow as many different types of plant as you can, including natives, and provide as much cover as possible. This should help ensure that you provide food and shelter at most times of year. Use permeable paving Think carefully before you pave over your front garden. Where paving is necessary, keep the area as small as possible and use permeable materials (planning permission is required for non-permeable materials). These measures allow the rainwater to soak into the soil, rather than causing flooding. Install green roofs Any birds-eye view of a town or city reveals that roofs cover a substantial area. It is possible to turn these barren spaces into planted surfaces by installing a green roof. These range from plant mats rolled out over a prepared base to flowery coverings grown in deeper soil – just make sure your roof can take the weight. Worth considering on your new shed or an extension, green roofs help reduce flooding and cool the surrounding surfaces and air."
"The Soma coal mine tragedy in Turkey has again brought the issue of coal mining safety to the fore. With by far the largest coal industry in the world, accounting for half of global production, the Chinese experience has some lessons to offer Turkey in the wake of the Soma disaster.  For many years the toll of miners’ lives in China attracted significant amounts of media attention. But the situation, while still serious, has shown great improvement in recent years and shows that reducing casualties in coal mining is possible. Up to the early 2000s, China’s coal safety record was an international embarrassment and a serious concern throughout Chinese society. During the 1990s, around 6,000 Chinese miners a year, or five people for every one million tons of coal produced, died in the mines. This compared to only 130 deaths, or 0.5 people for every million tons in India, not to mention the much higher safety levels of other big coal producers such as the United States or Australia.   But in recent years, the situation has dramatically improved, with deaths falling to just over 1000, or 0.3 people for every million tons in 2013. This is still a large number of casualties from coal mining, but given the massive expansion of the industry, still a great achievement. As an emerging power that is similarly reliant on coal, Turkey can look to China to make improvements to its mining culture going forward. A number of factors contributed to the earlier high fatalities in China. The great majority of Chinese coal was, and to a lesser extent still is, mined from underground mines. These are inherently more dangerous than open-cut mines (though that is neither to deny the potential for reducing underground fatalities nor to gainsay the serious environmental implications of open-cast mines).  In particular failure to remove gas from underground mines or to reduce the amount of coal dust in them is often the cause of the largest disasters. In 2005 China experienced three explosions each costing over one hundred lives, and the recent disaster in Turkey originated in an explosion, trapping miners below ground. The Chinese government’s almost exclusive focus on economic growth relegated safety and the necessary investments in safety to a lower priority. At the same time, even the large mines faced serious cost pressures and safety was easy to economise on. Large numbers of small rural mines, mostly using relatively primitive technology, operated largely without supervision and often bribed regulators when they were inspected; their record was by far the worst. Many of these features began to change in the early 2000s. More coal began to be mined by open-cast methods, especially in the newly developing areas of Inner Mongolia. The leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao (who started life as a geologist) started to put more emphasis on social problems, including coal safety, and passed a series of measures forcing mining companies to invest in equipment to remove gas from the mines.   At the same time booming coal prices helped fund these investments. The government also made accidents more expensive for mining companies by increasing the amount of compensation they had to pay for casualties under their watch. China also closed or consolidated small rural mines – often in the face of local governments and populations who depended on them for income and employment. International expertise was also welcomed, with foreign mine safety experts like New Zealander Dave Feickert playing prominent roles. Improvements in China were also the result of social factors like a tightening of the labour supply, which had previously seemed limitless. This labour squeeze was first felt in the export-oriented factories on the coast. In mining areas, parents are unwilling to allow their only son to risk his life in dangerous pits. Even in the early 2000s, coal experts were asking who would mine China’s coal in 20 years time?  China’s story suggests that there is no single fix, but numerous improvements in standards and safety are possible in the coal mining industry. Of course the immediate factors are technological and organisational, such as the removal of gas or more broadly a shift to open-cut mines. But strong commitment from the state, and a willingness to trade some growth in output for improved safety, is clearly also necessary. Businesses must be presented with incentives for safe production, while having the ability to make the necessary investments. Finally, those incentives will be much greater if the workers have more say and more bargaining power, as happens when the supply of labour begins to decline."

Investment companies that run index funds—which merely seek to replicate the ups and downs of a broader market index and that entail no investment strategy by any managers—are becoming ever more popular, with a greater proportion of our retirement savings are going into them. Forty percent of all stock is currently held in such passively managed funds, and three large investment companies with popular index funds—Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street—together hold nearly $13 trillion in assets.



Index funds can be great investments for the middle class, since management fees are low that means net returns are higher, and in the long run they tend to outperform nearly every actively‐​managed stock market fund offered. The SEC recognizes the benefits they deliver and it has simpler filing requirements for investors that do not seek to exert an active control over a company.



However, these behemoths do manage to exert their influence over the companies they invest in via their proxies. Given their size,​they each control​a significant percentage of each company in the S&P 500, which means they have the potential to tip the scales on contentious proxy proposals by voting together on shareholder proposals to change corporate governance.





Once people come to see that some of their money is being spent on activities that have nothing to do with performance we may engender some genuine competition between index funds.



In the last decade they have begun to exert their growing, collective influence in an attempt to improve corporate behavior and procedures companies, with some success: The ten‐​year poison pill is nearing extinction, there are many fewer classified boards these days, and nearly 90 percent of companies in the S&P 500 have majority voting requirements.



However, of late these funds have been increasingly using their proxies to vote for proposals that are tangential to corporate governance, and some these hold the potential to hurt the bottom line of the companies being targeted. First and foremost of these, of course, is the increasing predilection for activists to introduce proposals to force the company to do more about climate change than would be prudent if they were to follow their fiduciary duty. For instance, earlier this year, Vanguard CEO F. William McNabb III released a letter to public companies outlining the priorities of its investment stewardship group, with specific reference to climate change.



With index funds increasingly likely to support such proposals it is likely that we will see more of these in the coming years, the result of which will do nothing to reduce climate change but will increase the cost of doing business for companies large and small.



Another increasingly common proposal has been to force companies to review their charitable giving, with an eye towards potential human rights issues—defined broadly—that might be affected through such giving.



The increasing support that index funds have been giving proxy proposals peripheral to a company’s bottom line (and potentially deleterious to its stock price) may be a manifestation of the greater indexation of the U.S. stock market. A point that Bloomberg’s Matt Levine has made in myriad ways in his always‐​informative daily column Moneystuff is that if fund managers are paid largely based on performance relative to their peers, then the sole motivation for index fund “managers” is to reduce their fees.



What happens to any individual stock is of no consequence to them, since it impacts their index fund peers equally. As a consequence it is easy to conceive of them agreeing to pursue strategies that might not be best for their clients whose money they “manage” but that give them some sort of nonpecuniary satisfaction—like the admiration of their friends or laudatory coverage in the press for their prescience or “courage.”



Fixing this potential moral hazard is tricky: Most people would probably agree that, presently, the benefits of indexation currently outweigh its potential drawbacks, so outlawing index funds doesn’t make sense for the foreseeable future and is probably impossible to boot.



But one thing we could potentially do would be to request that these funds provide more information to their millions of passive investors informing them of the extent and cost of the activities they undertake with regards to proxy voting. We might consider allowing investors with money in these funds to ask why they vote the way they do, or why they choose to vote at all on these peripheral proxies.



Once people come to see that some of their money is being spent on activities that have nothing to do with performance we may engender some genuine competition between index funds.

In recorded human history, no set of political institutions have outlived those of the Venetian Republic. Founded in the ashes of the Roman Empire, it survived as an independent republic until it was captured by Napoleon in 1797. Throughout its existence, it displayed a remarkable degree of political stability; furthermore, it was a place of relative prosperity and a hub of Mediterranean trade. In the 17th century, the nominal wages of unskilled laborers in Venice were higher than anywhere else in Europe, with the exception of Spain, which was coping with the inflow of specie from the New World.



One reason for Venice’s political exceptionalism, according to the historian Thomas Madden, was that Venice “lacked inalienable land. Instead, it was a city of liquid wealth and commerce.” Mr. Madden, a professor of medieval history at St. Louis University, recently wrote an authoritative history of Venice, focusing in great detail on the political environment of the city‐​state.



Over time, intricate political institutions developed, which not only ensured peaceful transfers of power but also restricted the power of the executive and created a climate conducive to business. Because Venice had no land and no natural resources, there was no point in setting up extractive feudal institutions, which were pervasive in Europe at that time. Instead, its institutions emerged to protect commerce, rather than extract resources—although evidence suggests that the capture of the government by the merchants later contributed to the economic stagnation of the city‐​state.



At any rate, some of the quirks of the Venetian political system seem to be prescient institutional inventions. Probably the best illustration is the procedure used to elect the chief magistrate, the Doge, which combined several elements that might improve the functioning of our contemporary political systems.





The study of Venice’s peculiar political institutions is valuable for our thinking about reform of Western political institutions.



On the morning after a Doge’s death the members of the “Maggior Consiglio,” the council representing the freemen of the city, convened to first select by lot 30 of its members older than 30 years, who were designated as “electors.” But if—perhaps by analogy to the U.S. Electoral College—you think that the 30 then simply elected the Doge, you’re mistaken.



Those 30 were reduced to 9 by lot. The 9 then designated a group of 40, each of whom needed 7 approval votes out of the 9 members of the committee. Back in the hall, with the entire Maggior Consiglio present, these 40 would be reduced by lot to 12. As before, the 12 would nominate 25 names, subject to approval by 9 members of the committee. In the hall, these 25 would be reduced to 9. In turn, the 9 nominated 5 names each, commanding the support of at least 7 members of the group. Those 45 would be reduced by lot to 11, and then nominate the 41 true electors of the Doge.



Only then would the real election begin. The 41 were kept isolated in the ducal palace until the Doge was elected. Each member of the “Quarantuno” could nominate a candidate. In the early years, a name would be picked at random, and a yes/​no vote would be held. This would be repeated until a candidate was found who had the support of 25 members. Later on, this sequential procedure was changed to simultaneous approval vote, where each member of the Quarantuno votes yes or no on each of the nominated candidates. The candidate with the highest number of votes would be elected as the new Doge, provided that he had the attained at least 25 yes votes.



The complex voting and randomization procedure was connected to a broader set of rules curbing electoral patronage, corruption, and factions. As Coggins and Perali put it,



Office holders were not permitted to succeed themselves, though many spent their careers moving from one office to another. No family was permitted more than one member on the Ducal Council or any significant nominating committee or administrative board. A nominee’s relatives were prohibited from voting in an election involving him. Campaigns were entirely forbidden; men were sought by offices rather than the other way round. Once elected to an office a person was required to serve, and a heavy fine was levied against those who declined.



While at first sight this electoral procedure seems needlessly complicated and whimsical, it had several desirable properties, which arguably contributed to its stability over time. It is not a stretch to imagine that our current political systems could be improved by emulating the following three features of Venetian political life.



Firstly, the elections of the Doge relied on an iteration of supermajority decisions. The consecutive votes required majorities ranging from 77.8 percent in the initial nomination by the committee of 9 to 61 percent in final election by the Quarantuno. Since Buchanan and Tullock, political economists tend to like supermajorities, because they make it more difficult to impose costs on minorities and curb winner‐​takes‐​all behavior.



Secondly, the element of randomness introduced into the election, as well as the complexity of the procedures, reduced the scope for strategic behavior and functioned as a truth‐​revealing mechanism. With the exception of the Quarantuno, there was no predictable link between the choices of consecutive committees and the outcome—the election of a particular candidate as a Doge. In other words, the electors acted as if behind a veil of ignorance and had little incentives to either misrepresent their preferences or to act in a narrow material interest.



Thirdly, at the final stage of the election process, approval voting was used. Political scientists have shown that, under plausible assumptions, approval voting encourages sincere voting, reflective of people’s true preferences. If one is allowed to cast votes for multiple candidates, there is little reason not to vote for one’s favorite candidate, even if one thinks that she has only a small chance of being elected. It is striking to see the Venetians stumble upon approval voting centuries ago before its desirable properties were documented by scholars—and indeed well before economists or political scientists started to think systematically about the implications of different decision‐​making rules.



According to Mr. Madden, Venetian institutions prevented both the rise of ambitious tyrants and mob rule. Regardless of whether one agrees with that assessment or not, the study of Venice’s peculiar political institutions is valuable for our thinking about reform of Western political institutions. True, Venice did not have an open political system and was certainly no libertarian paradise. Yet, at the very least, its example seems to strengthen, rather than weaken, the case for the increased use of supermajorities and truth‐​revealing mechanisms, possibly involving randomization and/​or approval voting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEffective January 1, 2013, oil-burning and natural gas furnaces in new homes are forbidden in Denmark. And beginning in 2016, homeowners will not be allowed to replace their old, existing gas or oil burning furnaces with a new one. Hat-Tip: Readers Edition.de/. Read here, in English.
If you think the green movement has gone off the rails in Germany, just look at neighboring Denmark. Reader’s Edition writes:
The ban of a certain type of heating impacts everyone who is planning to build a new home, which is 1-2% of all homes. But at the latest in 2016, owners of older homes will also be affected.”
As is often the case with bureacrats, they failed to think out the possible consequences. Readers Edition reminds us:
This approach is not without risk. The question arises concerning the safety of an existing heater that goes on the blink just after the 2016 deadline. Will there be a huge temptation to continue running the risky furnace?”

It’s not clear on how Danes plan to stay wwarm in the future. District heating is more common in the Nordic country than in other European countries. Yet district heating accounts only for 35% of all Danish homes, and the heat is generated mostly by gas and oil.
There’s no mention how the other 65% of Danes will keep warm after 2016.
If you’re surprised by Denmark’s radicalism, don’t be. This is the same activist country that imposed a tax on fat back in 2011. Danish bureaucrats obviously thought their citizens were too stupid to know how to properly feed themselves, and so needed the nanny hand of a bureaucrat to spoon-feed them. So it really isn’t a surprise they also have to be taught how to stay warm.
Obviously, the Danes believe that their tiny country cutting back on their share of the world’s CO2 emissions (something like 0.2%) and thus theoretically preventing 0.0000001°C of warming by the year 2100 will rescue the polar bears and immunize people against bad weather.
Their fat tax, by the way, was abolished just a year later.

UPDATE 1: Russian media seems to confirm the new record: http://publicpost.ru/theme/id/3284/oymyakon/! Here it writes:

Село Оймякон — самая холодная точка на планете. На днях тут похолодало до минус 71 градуса — это самая низкая температура за всю историю измерения. Предыдущий рекорд был в 1933 году, когда ударил мороз минус 67,8 градусов.

In English (Bing translation):
The village of Oymyakon is the coldest point on the planet. The other day here it became colder to minus 71 degrees is the lowest temperature ever measured. The previous record was in 1933, when the Frost hit minus 67.8 degrees.”
But others point out that Weather Underground, for example, shows no temperatures being close to that. So the mystery remains. For the time being, there is no record until otherwise officially stated.
====================================
That’s -71.2°C, and it shatters the previous record of -68°C (-90.4°F) set in 1933! Hat-tip DirkH.
There’s been a lot of confusion over the last couple of days concerning a record low temperature allegedly just recorded in Siberia.
It appears that the record was actually set on February 19, in Oymyakon, Siberia.

News website borlife.de/ reports here. It writes near the end:
Oymyakon: Coldest Town in the World – 71 ° Celsius
It was just a few days ago that Oymyakon became famous. With -71° Celsius, it recorded a new record cold temperature, which until then had been unique to 2 villages. Until then the record of -68°C had to be shared with the town of Werchojansk – however, this is now history.”
This Italian site also reports that the new record was just set days ago, on February 19, smashing to pieces the old record of -68°C set in 1933, 80 years ago:
Un nuovo record di freddo è stato stabilito nella giornata di oggi in Siberia. Nella città di Oymyakon è stato raggiunto l’incredibile valore di -71°C! Battuto il precedente record di -68°C che resisteva ormai dal lontano 1933. Tutta la Siberia e la Russia stanno sperimentado una fase di gelo intenso, con -50°C toccati anche nella regione di Dzalinda.”
My Italian isn”t the best, but I’d translate that as follows:
A new record cold was recorded today in Siberia. In the town of Oymyakon the incredible value of -71.2°C was reached. It beat the previous record of -68° C that which stood since 1933. All of Siberia and Russia are in a phase of extreme frost. The area of Dzalinda is hit with -50°C.”
Italian readers may want to improve that translation for me.
Die Welt kept it off the front page, confirmed the temperature reading, but doesn’t call it a “record”, read here.

Burma’s agony continues. The military dictatorship held a rigged election Nov. 14 to cloak itself in civilian garb. The people of Burma will continue to suffer under one of the worst governments on Earth.



Nearly a half century after the military seized power, the country is ruled by a junta headed by Gen. Than Shwe. The military’s crimes are many: imposing a corrupt and brutal dictatorship, conducting a genocidal war against dissident ethnic groups, suppressing civil and political liberties, impoverishing the country, and enriching political elites.



In 1990 the junta foolishly held an election. The Burmese people overwhelmingly voted for Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. So the generals voided the result, suppressed the NLD, and quarantined Suu Kyi, subjecting her to house arrest for 15 of the last 21 years.





The people of Burma will continue to suffer under one of the worst governments on Earth.



The junta decided to hold another election, but rigged this one from the start.



There was no independent election commission and/​or foreign observers. No electioneering, let alone criticism of the government, was permitted. Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, complained that the vote was “conducted in a climate of fear, intimidation and resignation.”



Some 2000 imprisoned democracy activists, including Suu Kyi and many other NLD members, were deemed ineligible to run. The NLD, the nation’s only legitimate governing force, therefore refused to participate and was forcibly disbanded by the regime. In contrast, the generals fielded “civilian” candidates for every office through the misnamed United Solidarity and Development Party.



All parties were required to affirm support for the 2008 constitution imposed by the junta. That document reserves one‐​fourth of the lower house and one‐​third of the upper house to the military, allows the “civilian” president to turn power over to the military, creates a National Defense and Security Council, and permits the military‐​controlled Union Election Commission to dismiss legislators.



The Burmese people understood that the generals would remain in charge. Ashin Issariya of the All Burma Monks Alliance observed: “It will be the same faces and the same system that we have been living with for decades. The name ‘elections’ does not change anything for us.”



Instead, the junta’s objective was an image makeover. Today the regime is reviled around the world and subject to U.S. and European sanctions.



The fact that the rigged election offers no prospect of change doesn’t mean the West should maintain its policy of isolation and sanctions. This strategy has manifestly failed. Today’s only winner is China, which has achieved disproportionate influence in Rangoon.



It is time to move in the opposite direction.



The U.S. should not aid the junta’s attempt to disguise its malign character. After a decent interval, however, Washington should consult with European and leading Asian states to forge a united strategy to press Burma for reform.



The U.S. government’s ability to influence events in Rangoon is limited. Broader international support, especially in Southeast Asia, is required for any hope of progress.



No policy offers much likelihood of success. But promising to eschew attempts at coercive regime change while offering rewards for political liberalization might provide the best, if still not a good, strategy to promote real change. It is the best of a bad set of options.

As warm records are set in germany, people over a vast area of Asia are moaning under a record cold. Russia is gripped by the worst winter since 1938, where already more than 90 people have frozen to death. Also in India and China people are suffering from the extreme cold.”
The video says Russia’s winter has been far too cold so far, with temperatures 15°C below normal. District heating systems have frozen up, people’s homes have lost heat. Many are forced to melt snow to get drinking water.
The cold extends to India, where 26 people have died. In China the mercury has plummeted to – 37°C. Snowstorms have snarled traffic.
Although relief has arrived in Eastern Europe and Moscow, none is in sight for Siberia, Mongolia, India, China for the week ahead (also see above chart):

"Few places on the planet are more at risk from the climate crisis than south Florida, where more than 8 million residents are affected by the convergence of almost every modern environmental challenge – from rising seas to contaminated drinking water, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, coastal erosion, flooding and vanishing wildlife and habitat. If scientists are right, the lower third of the state will be underwater by the end of the century. Yet despite this grim outlook, scientists, politicians, environment groups and others are tackling the challenges head on. Below are some of the biggest threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today, along with solutions under consideration. Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all. The threat: By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise up to 31in  by 2060, a devastating prediction for a region that already deals regularly with tidal flooding and where an estimated 120,000 properties on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say – it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, according to some studies. Possible solutions: Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the Nature Conservancy have combined their efforts through the south-east regional action climate plan to tackle the crisis. In Miami Beach, dubbed the “ground zero” of sea rise, a multifaceted and costly Rising Above program is already under way. It includes elevating roads, building new sea walls and installing new and higher capacity pumps and drainage systems to alleviate flooding. In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards managed retreat: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, some within two decades. The cost: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach’s $400m Forever Bond, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county’s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage. In the Keys, many consider the estimated $60m a mile cost of raising roads too expensive. The threat: Saltwater from sea level rise is seeping further inland through Florida’s porous limestone bedrock and contaminating underground freshwater supplies, notably in the Biscayne aquifer, the 4,000-sq mile shallow limestone basin that provides drinking water to millions in southern Florida. Years of over-pumping and toxic runoff from farming and the sugar industry in central Florida and the Everglades have worsened the situation. The Florida department of environmental protection warned in March that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years”. A rising water table, meanwhile, has exacerbated problems with south Florida’s ageing sewage systems. Since December, millions of gallons of toxic, raw sewage have spilled on to Fort Lauderdale’s streets from a series of pipe failures. Possible solutions: A comprehensive 30-year Everglades restoration plan was authorized by Congress in 2000 to “restore, preserve and protect” the south Florida ecosystem by improving water flows to help flush the salinity, and a 78bn-gallon Everglades agricultural area reservoir (EAA), a key component of the congressional plan, is earmarked for land once leased by big sugar. The restoration plan, however, has stalled amid funding wrangles, and the storage reservoir plan delayed several times. The cost: The Everglades restoration plan was originally priced at $7.8bn, rose to $10.5bn, and has since ballooned to $16.4bn. Donald Trump’s proposed 2021 federal budget includes $250m for Everglades restoration. The estimated $1.8bn cost of the reservoir will be split between federal and state budgets. The threat: In October 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as the first category 5 cyclone to strike the US since 1992. In the devastating hurricane season just one year before, major storms named Harvey, Maria and Irma combined to cause damage estimated at $265bn. Scientists have evidence the climate crisis is causing cyclones to be more powerful, and intensify more quickly, and Florida’s position at the end of the Atlantic Ocean’s “hurricane alley” makes it twice as vulnerable as any other state. Possible solutions: Previous efforts to tame hurricanes were a failure, and experts see mitigation strategies, including more robust building codes, as the best defense. Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which destroyed more than 63,000 houses, led to the implementation of a statewide construction code that is updated every three years, though there are regional variations, and criticisms that industry lobbyists have too much sway. The cost: With homeowners and businesses largely bearing their own costs, the specific amount spent on “hurricane-proofing” in Florida is impossible to know. A 2018 Pew research study documented $1.3bn in hazard mitigation grants from federal and state funding in 2017, along with a further $8bn in post-disaster grants. Florida is spending another $633m from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development on resiliency planning. The threat: Florida’s native flora and fauna are being devastated by climate change, with the Florida Natural Areas Inventory warning that a quarter of the 1,200 species it tracks is set to lose more than half their existing habitat, and the state’s beloved manatees and Key deer are at risk of extinction. Warmer and more acidic seas reduce other species’ food stocks and exacerbate the deadly red-tide algal blooms that have killed incalculable numbers of fish, turtles, dolphins and other marine life. Bleaching and stony coral tissue disease linked to the climate crisis threaten to hasten the demise of the Great Florida Reef, the only living coral reef in the continental US. Encroaching saltwater has turned Big Pine Key, a crucial deer habitat, into a ghost forest. Possible solutions: The diverse range of challenges requires a piecemeal approach. A state and federally funded “Noah’s ark” is collecting and preserving coral chunks at venues including Nova Southeastern University as disease research continues. A new state taskforce of marine scientists and biologists is tackling the blue-green algae outbreaks that have choked Florida’s inland waterways. As for the Key deer, of which fewer than 1,000 remain, volunteers leave clean drinking water to replace salt-contaminated watering holes as herds retreat to higher ground. A longer-term debate is under way on the merits and ethics of relocating the species to other areas of Florida or the US. The cost: Florida is spending $4m in the current financial year for expanded water quality analytics related to “nutrient over-enrichment” and $3m annually for the next five years on Red Tide research. A 20-year project backed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to restore 3m sq feet of the Great Florida Reef is estimated at $100m. Such projects can only scratch the surface of the incalculable investment that will be needed to save the states species and their habitats. The threat: Tourist brochures showcase miles of golden, sandy beaches in South Florida, but the reality is somewhat different. The Florida department of environmental protection deems the entire coastline from Miami to Cape Canaveral “critically eroded”, the result of sea level rise, historically high tides and especially storm surges from a succession of powerful hurricanes. In south-eastern Florida’s Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, authorities are waging a continuous war on sand loss, eager to maintain their picture-perfect image and protect two of their biggest sources of income, tourism dollars and lucrative property taxes from waterfront homes and businesses. Possible solutions: With the other option abandoning beaches to the elements, city and county commissions have little choice but costly replenishment projects with sand replacement and jetty construction. Federal law prohibits the importation of cheaper foreign sand, so the municipalities must source a more expensive alternative from US markets, often creating friction with residents who don’t want to part with their sand. Supplementary to sand replenishment, the Nature Conservancy is a partner in a number of nature-based coastal defense projects from West Palm Beach to Miami. The cost: Authorities usually match federal funding for replenishment projects. An $8m project restored almost 125,000 cubic yards to three Broward county beaches last winter, and $55m will be spent on a 400,000-sq yd restoration on three others beginning in the fall. The region’s showpiece, Miami Beach, benefited from 61,000 cubic yards of new sand this year at a cost of $16m. Statewide, Florida spends an average $50m annually on beach erosion. The threat: “Climate gentrification” is a buzzword around south Florida, a region barely 6ft above sea level where land has become increasingly valuable in elevated areas. Speculators and developers are eyeing historically black, working-class and poorer areas, pushing out long-term residents and replacing affordable housing with upscale developments and luxury accommodations that only the wealthy can afford. In Miami, the controversial Magic City Innovation District in the neighborhood of Little Haiti is a billion-dollar, 17-acre, towering behemoth blending commercial, residential, entertainment and hotel space. It has drawn legal action from locals who say their rights have been trampled. Possible solutions: Experts argue there are ways to lessen the impact of climate gentrification on local populations without the need for displacement, such as providing affordable working space and housing for existing residents, and using sustainable construction practices and environmentally friendly materials. Magic City’s developers insist they are committed to the neighborhood, including below-market-cost housing. Local authorities and activist groups are working to “protect” areas by investing in revitalization and affordable housing projects. The cost: No study has yet calculated the overall cost of affordable housing lost to the climate crisis. Private developers will bear the expense of mitigating the impact on the neighborhood – $31m in Magic City’s case over 15 years to the Little Haiti Revitalization Trust, largely for new “green” affordable housing. The University of Miami’s housing solutions lab has a $300,000 grant from JPMorgan to report on the impact of rising seas to South Florida’s affordable housing stocks and recommend modifications to prevent it from flooding and other climate events. A collaboration of not-for-profit groups is chasing $75m in corporate funding for affordable housing along the 70-mile south Florida rail trail from Miami to West Palm Beach, with the first stage, a $5m project under way to identify, build and renovate 300 units. The threat: Florida has long been plagued by political leadership more in thrall to the interests of big industry than the environment. As governor from 2011 to 2019, Rick Scott, now a US senator, slashed $700m from Florida’s water management budget, rolled back environmental regulations and enforcement, gave a free ride to polluters, and flip-flopped over expanding offshore oil drilling. The politician who came to be known as “Red Tide Rick”, for his perceived inaction over 2018’s toxic algae bloom outbreaks, reportedly banned the words “climate change” and “global warming” from state documents. Possible solutions: It’s too soon for deep deliberations on Scott’s successor, fellow Republican Ron DeSantis, but in little more than a year in office he has made several moves that surprised environmentalists. He appointed Florida’s first chief science officer, created an algae taskforce, struck a deal to prevent drilling in parts of the Everglades, and won a tussle with Florida’s legislature to expand an ambitious land acquisition and preservation program. Last month, state legislators approved the first dedicated climate bill. It appears a promising start for a new administration, but activists say more needs to be done. In January, the Sierra Club awarded DeSantis failing grades in an environmental report card, saying he failed to protect Florida’s springs and rivers and approved new roads that threatened protected wildlife. The cost: Florida’s spending on the environment is increasing. The state budget passed last month included $650m for Everglades restoration and water management projects (an instalment of DeSantis’s $2.5bn four-year pledge) and $100m for Florida Forever. A $100m bridge project jointly funded by the state and federal governments will allow the free flow of water under the Tamiami Trail for the first time in decades. Florida has woken up to the threat of climate change but it is not yet clear how effective the response will be. The challenges are innumerable, the costs immense and the political will to fix or minimize the issues remains questionable, despite recent progress. At stake is the very future of one of the largest and most diverse states in the nation, in terms of both its population and its environment. Action taken now will determine its survival.

"Wildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought. Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.  Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen. By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest. “It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature. What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse. The authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005. Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 “Despite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn’t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one – or a few – snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,” Pigot explained. “In our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.” The scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an “abrupt exposure event”, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage. But at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures. That means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by “flattening the curve” of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt. “It is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,” said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study. “Our research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.” Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting. This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating. Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss. “The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”"

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Is it hot enough for you?   
  
You don’t know, and neither do global warming policy wonks.   
  
Climatologically speaking, temperatures peak in the second half of July, especially here in the East. Thanks to this, global warming horror stories also max out, followed by the usual pleadings for this or that regulation of dreaded carbon dioxide. The latest greatest rage in a direct tax on carbon dioxide emissions, which will no doubt be trotted out in this week’s eastern heat.   
  
But how hot is it? We know what the thermometer reads, but how does that compare to past thermometer readings?   
  
It turns out there are several factors that confound temperature histories—some obvious, some subtle, and no doubt an unknown number of things that are simply missed.   
  
An obvious one is that bricks, buildings and pavement increasingly “urbanize” the climate, retaining the heat built up during the day and impeding cross ventilation from the local wind regime. To compensate, most long-term temperature histories adjust urban temperatures in comparison to neighboring stations.   
  
A more subtle one is that a systematic change in the time of day in which the high and low temperatures are read (and reset) is also important. As an example, consider a station in which the observer records the previous 24-hour high and low temperatures at 5pm, local time. That’s near the time of day, in the summer, when temperatures are around their daily high. If the day is really hot, say, 100° or so, the temperature at 5:01 is likely to be the same, meaning there are two very hot days recorded when there may have only been one if temperatures were reset at midnight.   
  
There are plenty of other adjustments made to local temperature histories such as accounting for movement of weather stations, changes to the local environment, and adjustments for technological changes, such as switching from mercury-in-glass to electronic thermometers.   
  
And there are some factors that are completely ignored and unaccounted for, having to do with economic factors. Near-neighbor comparisons aren’t going to do a bit of good if an entire country (say, Chad) is too poor to spend anything maintaining weather stations. The fact is that as they “weather,” unattended stations get darker, which means that the temperature gets hotter.   




More on this later.   
  
Consider the Department of Commerce’s US Historical Climate Network (USHCN) for the lower 48 states.   
  
Here’s the raw data (Figure 1), courtesy of Steve Goddard at Real Science (as opposed to the reliably alarmist site “RealClimate”).   






_Figure 1. Unadjusted temperature history of the United States (figure fromReal Science)._



Accounting for changes in the time of observation induces a slight warming trend of a couple of tenths of a degree per century since 1930—but that’s nowhere near the shocking change that results from additional adjustments (Figure 2):   






_Figure 2. Adjusted temperature history of the United States (figure fromReal Science)._



Here’s the difference between the raw and the adjusted data over the entire period of record, which begins in 1895 (Figure 3):   






_Figure 3. Difference between the adjusted and the raw temperature history of the United States (figure fromReal Science)._



The magnitude of the post-1950 warming induced by data adjustment is in fact equal to over half of the total warming.   
  
What about the effects that aren’t accounted for? A few years back, Guelph University economist Ross McKitrick and yours truly (PJM) calculated the “non climatic” signal in long term temperature histories. Here’s a map of the difference between temperatures adjusted for those factors and what has been reported (Figure 4).   






_Figure 4. Difference bewteen observed and adjusted trends around the world. Positive values mean the observed trends are greater than the trends adjusted to remove non-climatic influences (figure from McKitrick and Michaels, 2007)._



One thing that jumps out is that U.S. temperature records are pretty devoid of much systematic bias (greenish colors are a change of near zero). Another is that really poor places—like much of Africa and rural South America don’t have a lot of high-quality data (reflected by the large expanses of white). What stations they do have are probably not subject to a lot of upkeep such as being painted or washed, making them systematically hotter than they actually are. Current analysis methods involving a comparison to neighboring stations aren’t going to uncover this bias that appears pervasive over large continental regions.   
  
This is one example of a systematic bias that induces artificial warming. And the reality is that we don’t know—obviously—what other factors we don’t know about!   
  
It is doubtful that people pushing the latest fad, such as a carbon tax, have any clue the degree to which global warming is being manufactured (rightly or wrongly) by systematic adjustments to weather data, or how much it is being exaggerated by still unaccounted biases. In climate, policy wonks are rushing in where they should fear to tread.

While there’s been thousands of legacy media stories about the very real decline in summer sea-ice extent in the Arctic Ocean, we can’t find _one_ about the statistically significant _increase_ in Antarctic sea ice that has been observed at the same time.   
  
Also, comparisons between forecast temperature trends down there and what’s been observed are also very few and far between. Here’s one published in 2015:   






_Observed (blue) and model-forecast (red) Antarctic sea-ice extent published by Shu et al. (2015) shows a large and growing discrepancy, but for unknown reasons, their illustration ends in 2005._



For those who utilize and trust in the scientific method, forming policy (especially _multi-trillion dollar_ policies!) on the basis of what could or might happen in the future seems imprudent. Sound policy, in contrast, is best formulated when it is based upon repeated and verifiable observations that are consistent with the projections of climate models. As shown above, this does not appear to be the case with the vast ice field that surrounds Antarctica.   
  
According to the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), CO2-induced global warming will result in a considerable reduction in sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere. Specifically, the report predicts a multi-model average decrease of between 16 and 67 percent in the summer and 8 to 30 percent in the winter by the end of the century (IPCC, 2013). Given the fact that atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by 20 percent over the past four decades, evidence of sea ice decline should be evident in the observational data if such model predictions are correct. But are they?   
  
Thanks to a recent paper in the _Journal of Climate_ by Josefino Comiso and colleagues, we now know what’s driving the increase in sea-ice down there. It’s—wait for it—cooling temperatures over the ocean surrounding Antarctica.   




This team of six researchers set out to produce an updated and enhanced dataset of sea ice extent and area for the Southern Hemisphere for the period 1978 to 2015. The key enhancement over prior datasets included an improved cloud masking technique that eliminated anomalously high or low sea ice values, assuring that their work is the most definitive study of Antarctic sea ice trends to date.   
  
The six scientists report the existence of a long-term increasing trend in both sea ice extent and area over the period of study (see figure below), with the former measure increasing by 1.7 percent per decade and the latter by 2.5 percent per decade.   






**_Figure 1._** _Monthly anomalies of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent (left panel) and area (right panel) derived using the newly enhanced SB2 data (black) of Comiso et al. and the older SBA data (red) prior to the enhancements made by Comiso et al. Trend lines for each data set are also shown and the trend values with statistical errors are provided. Source: Comiso et al. (2017)._



With regard to these observed increases, Comiso _et al_. confirm “the trend in Antarctic sea ice cover is positive,” adding “the trend is even more positive than previously reported because prior to 2015 the sea ice extent was anomalously high for a few years, with the record high recorded in 2014 when the ice extent was more than 20 x 106 km2 for the first time during the satellite era.”   
  
They compared satellite-based estimates of temperature over the ocean/ice and found a very high negative correlation between ice cover and temperature. So, the large and systematic increase in ice extent must be related to a cooling over the sea-ice region throughout the 36-year period of record in this study.   
  
Why is this important? Much like the problems with the missing “tropical hot spot” we noted last month, Antarctic sea-ice modulates a cascade of meteorology. When it’s gone, or in decline, as is the forecast from the climate models, much more of the sun’s energy goes into the ocean, as that energy is only very poorly absorbed by ice, which means an enhanced warming of the Southern Ocean. That has effects on Antarctica itself, where slightly warmed surrounding waters will dramatically increase snowfall on the continent. The fact that there are only glimmerings of this showing up (if at all) should have tipped people off that something was very wrong with the temperature forecast for the nearby ocean.   
  
Consequently, it is clear that despite a 20 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, and model predictions to the contrary, sea ice in the Antarctic has expanded for decades. Such observations are in direct opposition to the model-based predictions of the IPCC.   
  
(N.B. as noted in our May Day post, the Antarctic ice sensor crashed last April, and subsequent data appears to be very unreliable and, in some cases, physically impossible.)

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome big energy developments in Germany lately.
Several readers pointed out an article appearing in the online daily Die Welt here. It seems that Eastern Europe has said “no” to hugely subsidized, unstable German green electricity flowing across the border into their power grids.
One reason is because Germany still has not installed the huge power transmission lines needed to deliver the sometimes massive wind and solar electricity directly to heavy industry in Central and Southern Germany. And it’ll be years before it can, if ever. Therefore Germany reroutes its intermittently massive amounts of wind and solar energy through the power grids of its Eastern European neighbors (mainly Poland and the Czech Republic) and then to its industry to the south.
The problem with this rerouting is that Poland and the Czech Republic now often find their power grids critically and unpredictably overloaded, and thus have decided to install equipment to keep German electricity out when certain levels are reached.
Die Welt writes:
Polish grid operator PSE has agreed to build together with grid operator 50 Hertz so-called phase shifters, with which excessive current flows can be blocked. Their use is planned to be ‘very soon’.”
So what happens if all the windparks and solar farms in Northeastern Germany cannot deliver their power to the industry ín the south via Poland? Stephan Kohler, Chief of semi-state-owned German Energy Agency (Dena) says.
The use of phase shifters will have the consequence that windparks in Eastern Germany will have to be shut down more often in the future because the power will have no way of being delivered to the markets.”
So the windpark operators in Eastern Germany will be getting the shaft, right? Wrong!
Germany’s Feed-In Act stipulates that windparks get paid whether or not their power gets bought. The costs for the electricity that never gets bought is simply gets passed on to the poor consumers.
Such is the world of the government centrally-controlled energy market. Is it any wonder that in just a few short years Germany’s electricity prices have risen to levels that are among the highest in the world?
Germans becoming fed up with green costs

Meanwhile Die Welt reports today that German consumers are fed up with the high prices of electricity, and are now loudly demanding a course correction with renewable energy.
The solutions to the problem now being proposed, however, are almost as lunatic as the idea of trying to power the country with renewable energy in the first place. Germany’s communist PDS party for example is calling for giving consumers incentives to purchase new, energy-efficient appliances. You see, consumers can solve their problem of not having enough money by simply forking out lots of money for new white goods. Make sense?
Another brilliant solution proposed by Greens and leftists is to force industry to pay more for electricity, and thus allow lower rates for little consumers. Of course the masterminds behind that idea still have not thought about what industry will do with the higher prices they’ll have to pay for their power. You don’t suppose they’d get the idea to pass the extra costs along to the consumers, do you?
Clearly we see in Europe that there is a creativity contest to see who can come up with the most lunatic ideas to keep the subsidized renewable scam going.
Amazingly, there are a couple of politicians who recognize the root of the problem, like CSU politician Gerda Hasselfeldt, who says “the SPD socialists and Greens are responsible for the rapidly rising energy prices. We have to try to control the transformation to renewable energy, and not do what Red-Green did: promote an uncontrolled expansion of renewable energy,” she said.
Well, at least she’s on the right track. The solution of course is to do away with the senseless, destructive subsidies altogether.
German coal will be around longer than you think
EU Energy Commissar Günther Oettinger told Die Welt that coal will have to continue playing a major role in Germany’s energy supply and to do so for “a lot longer than what some are prepared to accept.”
Wind turbine lifeime is only 10 – 15 years!
Finally, there’s another bit of bad news  indicating that wind power is going to cost consumers a lot more. The Renewable Energy Foundation has published a new study, The Performance of Wind Farms in the United Kingdom and Denmark, showing that the economic life of onshore wind turbines is between 10 and 15 years, not the 20 to 25 years projected by the wind industry itself, and used for government projections. Read more here.
Tough times ahead for the renewable energy pipe-dream.

NCEP NAM/WRF 4-km rainfall forecast (next 60-hours)
For those in SE Texas hoping for some drough relief from Tropical Storm Don, so far early Saturday morning after landfall, a trace or scant rainfall is to be found.  Don’s convection has distintigrated with only a weak-low level swirl evident on radar.  Hopefully as daytime heating occurs on Saturday and Sunday, a thunderstorm can pop up.
The NCEP 4-km NAM/WRF simulated radar forecast shows the circulation progressing across Texas Rio Grande during the next 24-36 hours before merging with the North American monsoon. However, rainfall forecast for the next 2.5 days shows a lot of white nothing across most of the drought-stricken state.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd if they can’t put the wind turbines up on ridgelines, there aren’t too many other places they could be put in Vermont. I guess developers could try putting them “offshore” on Lake Champlain – yeah, right. That would be as stupid as putting them on mountain ridgelines.

Lukas Snelling brings a bit of good news about the public mood regarding wind turbines in the state at Energize Vermont. Normally, I write about news in Germany, but I hope readers will forgive me for sometimes meandering off to Vermont, my native state.
Vermonters are beginning to sober up. Perhaps some of that fine Scotch has finally made its way to the Green Mountains and instilled a little sanity in the Yankee culture after all.
The latest numbers released today from the Castleton Polling Institute show support for ridgeline wind in Vermont continues to erode. Support for wind on Vermont’s ridgelines reached a high of 74% in favor in Vermont’s deliberative polling back in 2008 to only 66% of Vermonter’s declaring their support for ridgeline wind today.
“Poll questions are overly simplistic and theoretical. Asking people if they like something without explaining the pros or cons doesn’t really give you a meaningful result. Polls with a low sample size and a high margin of error poll are not reliable gauges of the status of the issue across the state,” said Lukas Snelling, Executive Director of Energize Vermont. “However, from these polls a clear trend has emerged. The more Vermonters know about these projects and their impacts, the fewer people support them.”

In 12 town votes from the last decade over 58% of voters have opposed the projects in their communities, with only 41% supporting them. The most recent votes in Hubbardton and Brighton were even stronger against with 94% opposed in Hubbardton and 62% opposed in Brighton. Additionally, Select Boards of the four Rutland County towns around the proposed Grandpa’s Knob project recently voted to oppose utility-scale wind in their communities. Three of the four town boards did so unanimously.
“Citizens investigating this technology’s impact on their communities are deciding wind projects don’t make for good neighbors. With four projects operating in Vermont and accumulating noise complaints, and another three communities with active developments, Vermonters are examining this technology more than they ever have before. We predict support will continue to erode as developers continue to push this technology on our communities,” continued Snelling.
“Vermonters are seeing that ridgeline wind in Vermont is less about the environment and more about generating revenue for the developers. We see interest in smaller-scale solutions and solar technologies growing everyday. We are actively building a renewable energy future for Vermont that is firmly within our legacy of environmental protection,” concluded Snelling.
The coming months will bring another benchmark of public opinion in the wind debate. Like last year, this year’s Town Meeting Day Doyle Poll will ask for Vermonter’s opinions on ridgeline wind in the State. Although unscientific, comparing this year’s results to last years will give another barometer of the trend. Last year 64% of respondents support wind turbine construction on our ridgelines statewide, with lower numbers in communities where projects were operating or proposed.
Energize Vermont was created to educate and advocate for establishing renewable energy solutions that are in harmony with the irreplaceable character of Vermont, and that contribute to the well-being of all her people. This mission is achieved by researching, collecting, and analyzing information from all sources; and disseminating it to the public, community leaders, legislators, media, and regulators for the purpose of ensuring informed decisions for long-term stewardship of our communities.
Sanity is returning (though there’s still a way to go, i.e. solar). Time for a toast with a little Bruichladdich.

From the University of Tennessee at Knoxville
Solar industry responsible for lead emissions in developing countries
Solar power is not all sunshine. It has a dark side—particularly in developing countries, according to a new study by a University of Tennessee, Knoxville, engineering professor.
A study by Chris Cherry, assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering, found that solar power heavily reliant on lead batteries has the potential to release more than 2.4 million tons of lead pollution in China and India.
Lead poisoning causes numerous adverse health effects, including damage to the central nervous system, the kidneys, the cardiovascular system, and the reproductive system. In children, blood lead concentration is associated with learning impairments, as well as hyperactive and violent behavior.
His study, co-authored with Perry Gottesfeld of Occupational Knowledge International (OK International), appears in the September issue of the journal Energy Policy.

Lead pollution predicted to result from investments in solar power by 2022 is equivalent to one-third of current global lead production. The researchers, who relied on official government plans for deploying solar power to make these projections, also found that the countries have large amounts of lead leak into the environment from mining, smelting, battery manufacturing, and recycling—33 percent in China and 22 percent in India. Also, a large percentage of new solar power systems continues to be reliant on lead batteries for energy storage due to the inadequate power grid in these countries.
The study’s release comes on the heels of reports of a large number of mass lead poisoning incidents around lead battery recycling and manufacturing plants in China and the announcement that the country recently closed 583 of these facilities.
“Investments in environmental controls in the lead battery industry, along with improvements in battery take-back policies, are needed to complement deployment of solar power in these countries,” said Cherry. “Without improvements, it is increasingly clear that the use of lead batteries will contribute to environmental contamination and lead poisoning among workers and children.”
The battery industry is the largest consumer of lead, using approximately 80 percent of global lead production. Lead battery manufacturing is growing rapidly in much of the world to meet demand for batteries for solar power and other applications. With the authors’ projected emissions, they say this will impact public health and contribute to environmental contamination.
“The solar industry has to step up and take responsibility for ensuring that their lead battery suppliers are operating with adequate controls as long as they are going to be reliant on this technology,” said Gottesfeld. “Without major improvements in the manufacturing and recycling lead batteries in these countries, we expect that lead poisoning will increase as the industry grows.”
The projections outlined in the study, while based on plans articulated by these two countries, are likely to be repeated throughout much of the developing world, such as in Africa.

"Global carbon emissions from the fossil fuel industry could fall by a record 2.5bn tonnes this year, a reduction of 5%, as the coronavirus pandemic triggers the biggest drop in demand for fossil fuels on record. The unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and industry due to the coronavirus is expected to cut billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic metres of gas and millions of tonnes of coal from the global energy system in 2020 alone, according to data commissioned by the Guardian. This would lead to the fossil fuel industry’s biggest drop in CO2 emissions on record, in a single year eclipsing the carbon slumps triggered by the largest recessions of the last 50 years combined. Climate experts expected global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production to rise in 2020, from an estimated 36.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide last year. Instead, emissions may fall by about 5%, or 2.5bn tonnes of CO2, to its lowest levels in about a decade. Dr Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, has warned against viewing the steep decline in emissions from fossil fuels as a climate triumph.  “This decline is happening because of the economic meltdown in which thousands of people are losing their livelihoods, not as a result of the right government decisions in terms of climate policies,” he said. “The reason we want to see emissions decline is because we want a more livable planet and happier, healthier people.” The fossil fuel analysis undertaken by Rystad Energy, a Norwegian energy consultancy, found a sharp contraction in GDP and the abrupt halt of flights and driving could cause the world’s oil demand to fall by more than five times the drop in demand triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008. The analysts estimate demand for crude will fall by an average of 11m barrels of oil a day this year, or 4bn barrels in total. This alone would cut 1.8bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, which would otherwise have contributed to the global climate crisis this year, according to Rystad. The analysts also expected a slump in electricity use and heavy industry to drive demand for gas and coal down by about 2.3% each, erasing carbon emissions from each fossil fuel by 200mtonnes and 500m tonnes respectively. Erik Holm Reiso, a senior partner at Rystad, said: “The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented event for energy markets, which will have a substantial impact on the world’s total carbon emissions. “The last time demand for oil contracted, during the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, demand fell by 1.3m barrels of oil a day. But Covid-19 could cause oil demand to fall by more than five times as much.” The unprecedented drop in oil demand will emerge in large part due the global aviation industry, he said. Typically there are about 99,700 commercial flights per day but the crackdown on non-essential travel to curb the spread of the virus could see air traffic fall by an average of almost a quarter over the year. Fewer cars on the road will also dent demand for petrol and diesel by an average of 9.4% over the year, shrinking oil demand in 2020 by an average of 2.6m barrels of oil a day. The analysts say the use of transport fuels may start recovering in the second half of the year, but found demand would lag the figures recorded last year. Energy demand in China, the world’s biggest importer of oil, is expected to begin recovering next month, four months after the outbreak in the Wuhan province. However it will not make a full return to normal levels until September at the earliest, according to Rystad. This could stoke a slow rise in global energy demand in the second half of 2020 but a recovery to 2019 levels is not forecast for this year. Resio said: “The real question is over the long-term impact of the virus. If we learn that remote working can work people may begin to question whether we need to take long haul flights to meet people in person. This could alter whether demand for oil ever recovers to the levels we have seen in previous years.” However, Birol said if governments didn’t take the right measures to include support for clean energy in new economic stimulus packages “then this decline could be easily wiped out in the rebound of the economy”, once Covid-19 is brought under control. He said: “These figures are important and impressive. But they don’t make me happy. For me it’s more important about what happens next year, and the year after that.”"

Assume you are a scientist and have been given a major financial grant to prove that the mythical unicorn really did exist.



You know that as long as you can demonstrate some progress in showing the unicorn might have existed, your financial grant will be renewed each year, provided some other scientist does not come out with substantial evidence that the unicorn could not have existed.



Under such conditions, you would have a very strong incentive to disregard much of the evidence that the unicorn could not have existed and each year provide only the data that could demonstrate that the unicorn might have existed. You also would have a very strong incentive to attack any scientist who raised serious questions or provided evidence that the unicorn could not have existed.





It has been all too evident that many in the man‐​made‐​global‐​warming camp have vested interests in certain outcomes because of the government grants they receive.



You even might go so far as to refer to them with the disparaging term “unicorn deniers” and attempt to use your influence with other scientists who also are receiving grants dependent on the existence of the unicorn to try to prevent the unicorn deniers from publishing their findings in well‐​regarded scientific journals.



The recently released e‐​mails (by whistleblowers or hackers, depending on your prejudice) between some of the best‐​known scientists behind global warming showed that they succumbed to the all‐​too‐​human tendency to protect their turfs and pocketbooks, despite the evidence.



As an economist, not a climatologist, I have followed the debate carefully for years. It has been all too evident that many in the man‐​made‐​global‐​warming camp have vested interests in certain outcomes because of the government grants they receive. (This is not meant to imply that most scientists have sold their integrity for government grants.)



It has been known for a couple of hundred years that the Earth goes through regular cooling and warming cycles. The legitimate debate is about how much man‐​made carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) contributes to the current cycle, if at all, and whether it is more cost‐​effective (or even possible) to try to modify climate change or just adapt to it through engineering changes (e.g., the dikes in Holland) and building at a greater distance from the shoreline.



My colleagues at the Cato Institute found many highly qualified climate scientists (hundreds of whom were willing to sign a public statement) who seriously questioned much of the “science” behind many of the legislative and other public policy demands of the global warming lobby.



Members of the media are usually quick to understand and publicize conflicts of interest for public officials when it comes to road‐​building contracts and the like but seem to be blind to the conflicts of interest for scientists and others who claim to be impartial scholars. The United Nations’ report on climate change is considered by many in the media and the political world to be a gold‐​plated standard of truth when it comes to the climate‐​change evidence — which we now know is tainted. What the media and the political class should be doing is seeking out those highly qualified climatologists and other relevant scientific experts with no financial or other vested interests (which include grants from either governments or industries that may have an economic interest) to provide independent evaluations of the evidence and arguments from all sources.



In my own field of economics, we find an international tax‐​increase lobby, almost all of whose members are dependent on government grants (directly or indirectly), to be endlessly lobbying for more taxes and regulations, which increase the power of the political class. The lobby routinely ignores the evidence that almost all governments tax and spend at rates far above the welfare and growth‐​maximizing rates and that more taxes and bigger expenditures reduce both economic opportunity and individual liberty.



Again ignoring the evidence from almost everywhere that more government makes things worse rather than better, the proponents of higher taxes also argue that government is about the only force for good and, if government only had more money, it would manage things better and waste less.



Sen. Judd Gregg, New Hampshire Republican, and Sen. Kent Conrad, North Dakota Democrat, have proposed a new, bipartisan commission to deal with the government deficit, and it already has 31 sponsors. The advocates know it ultimately will recommend some cuts in government spending and increases in some taxes. They are either intellectually ignorant or corrupt because the effort is focused on the deficit, which is only a residual of the real problem — excessive government spending — which neither party has the intellectual and moral courage to address seriously.



Can you think of something much more intellectually dishonest than saying health care reform will insure many millions more, will not add to the deficit, will not result in any increases in taxes for anyone but the rich and will “bend the cost curve down”? Hmmm.



Businesspeople are fined and even sent to jail for making false claims about what their goods or services will do. If false‐​claims standards were applied to the political class (and those who report this misinformation as fact) how many in Congress, the administration and mainstream media would be out of jail?

"**Pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter Covid-19 restrictions in the run up to Christmas, the first minister has said.**
The new restrictions, which have not yet been finalised, will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
They may be based on the system in some parts of Scotland where no alcohol can be served.
Cinemas, bowling alleys and indoor entertainment venues will also have to shut before the festive break.
A date for these to close has not yet been agreed.
Mark Drakeford said action was needed as case rates continued to rise in the run up to Christmas.
But the Welsh Conservatives said any new restrictions would be a ""real blow"" for businesses who had already ""suffered greatly"", while Plaid Cymru said the lack of detail was leaving employers unable to prepare.
Pubs, bars and restaurants had only reopened on 9 November after the Wales-wide 17-day lockdown, and are currently made to close at 22:00 GMT.
Ahead of the announcement people working in the hospitality industry had warned any further restrictions before Christmas would be a ""big blow"".
Plans for the new rules have not yet been finalised, but BBC Wales understands one option being considered is the ""level three"" Scottish system, where venues are banned from selling alcohol and have to close at 18:00.
The R rate - the number of people each infected person passed the virus on to - has risen again to 1.4 in Wales, with the rate needing to be below one for the number of cases to fall.
In England about 55 million people are being placed under the tightest level of lockdown rules from 2 December, when an England-wide lockdown ends and a new tiered system is introduced.
Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said Wales had to use the ""coming weeks"" to reduce the spread of the virus, to ""create more headroom for the Christmas period"".
Mr Drakeford said while case rates had fallen following the 17-day firebreak, as people had resumed socialising it they had risen ""faster and further than we anticipated"", and action was needed.
""This does not mean a return to the firebreak arrangements, but the cabinet has agreed to take further specific and targeted action to reinforce the current national measures we have place,"" he said.
Mr Drakeford said he could ""not rule anything out for the future"" in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.
Non-essential retail, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres will stay open, it was confirmed.
Speaking of the new measures for pubs, bars and restaurants, Mr Drakeford added: ""I know this will be a worrying time for all working in the industry.
""We will be working over the weekend with partners to finalise the details of the new arrangements and to put in place a further major package of financial support to respond to those changes.
""I will give further details about the package on Monday.""
Claire Vaughan, programme manager at Chapter cinema in Cardiff, said: ""Globally no cases of coronavirus have been traced back to a visit to the cinema.
""Cinemas are a low-risk way of spending time outside the house at a time when the mental health of people in Wales is a huge concern.
""Masks are worn, there are air circulation units and no one is facing another person... Not everyone is living in a warm, safe home - many people need these spaces to be open.""
Liam Evans-Ford, Theatr Clwyd's executive director, added the announcement had been a ""huge surprise"".
""This is devastating for our business, for our employees, for our freelancers and for our communities,"" he said.
Sian Shepphard, owner of the Horse and Jockey in Pontypool, opened the pub in August so has not been eligible for government support.
""The main problem is we are trying to get people to stay at home but it is ruining our businesses,"" she said.
""I employ over 25 staff here - we are a really family-run business. We are all family - how am I supposed to put food on the table for them?""
Phil James, a customer at the pub, said the potential changes would affect his Christmas plans.
""We just don't know what arrangement to make at the end of the day - people have to know. You come out to socialise - people want to be social for Christmas, alcohol is a part of it.""
Simon Buckley, chairman of The Brewers of Wales, said: ""Is this finally the straw that will break the industry's back?
""We as an industry are being thrown to the wind, and the looming prospect of significant job losses seems to count for nothing.""
Plaid's economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said: ""They [pubs and restaurants] don't know if they're being asked to close altogether again, to only do takeaways, to have restricted opening without alcohol.
""So, they can't really prepare. They need to be given the maximum length of time to prepare.""
Clwyd West member of the Senedd Darren Millar called for a targeted rather than a Wales-wide blanket approach.
""It is grossly unfair to impose the same level of restrictions in Conwy and Denbighshire as Covid-19 hotspots in south Wales,"" he said.
""The virus is circulating at different rates in different parts of the country.""
Mr Drakeford insisted there were no plans to introduce regionalised ""tiered"" restrictions, similar to those coming into force in England.
He said there was no case for aligning the Welsh and English systems to ensure no-one was left out of UK-wide Treasury schemes that offer financial assistance to businesses affected by lockdown measures.
""We don't lose out on any UK system by having a single tier for Wales, so there is no disadvantage to us in that,"" he said.
He added: ""The advice we have is that a single set of arrangements for Wales works best, is easiest to communicate and delivers benefits in all parts of Wales.""
Pembrokeshire councillor John Davies welcomed the restrictions after a spike in cases in his ward, Cilgerran, linked to the recent outbreak in nearby Cardigan.
He told Newyddion 9: ""If people aren't willing to exercise common sense and be citizens of responsibility towards each other, there is no other option.
""We've seen what happens in this part of the world when people act in a selfish manner.""
Mr Drakeford said he had no plans to allow schools to close early for Christmas.
Teaching union UCAC had called for classrooms to be shut on 11 December and for lessons to be moved online amid fears teachers and pupils may have to isolate on Christmas Day.
But Mr Drakeford said ministers would do ""everything we can"" to keep schools working up until the Christmas holiday.
He added: ""It is more important for our children not to miss out further on the education that is planned for them for the whole of the rest of this term and that's what we will be working to achieve."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooking at the temperature chart of the Danish Meteorological Institute, we see that the Arctic above 80°N has turned quite frosty. The polar bears are probably the only ones enjoying it.

Chart above shows the years 2004, 2010, and 2013. Source: http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php.
Checking the charts from the years before, we see that today’s Arctic temperature is a hair lower than the low of 2010 (it’s very close), and is thus the lowest since 2004. At Twitter a couple a days ago I think it was Ryan Maue who said that the Arctic was in for a cold snap, and so it’s possible temperatures above 80°N may even drop further before this ends.
Will be interesting to watch in the days ahead. I wonder if they’ll blame it on warming.

The bad news this morning on the impact of both the federal stimulus and the Cash for Clunkers program should not come as a surprise to anyone who has paid attention to the history of government intervention in the economy.   
  
  
New data that the jobs created by the stimulus have been overstated by thousands is compelling, but it’s really a secondary issue. The primary issue is that the government cannot “create” anything without hurting something else. To “create” jobs, the government must first extract wealth from the economy via taxation, or raise the money by issuing debt. Regardless of whether the burden is borne by present or future taxpayers, the result is the same: job creation and economic growth are inhibited.   
  
  
At the same time the government is taking undeserved credit for “creating jobs,” a new analysis of the Cash for Clunkers program by Edmunds​.com shows that most cars bought with taxpayer help would have been purchased anyhow. The same analysis finds the post‐​Clunker car sales would have been higher in the absence of the program, which proves that the program merely altered the timing of auto purchases.   
  
  
Once again, the government claims to have “created” economic growth, but the reality is that Cash for Clunkers had no positive long‐​term effect and actually destroyed wealth in the process.   
  
  
Right now businesses and entrepreneurs are hesitant to make investments or add new workers because they’re worried about what Washington’s interventions could mean for their bottom lines. The potential for higher taxes, health care mandates, and costly climate change legislation are all being cited by businesspeople as reasons why further investment or hiring is on hold. Unless this “regime uncertainty” subsides, the U.S. economy could be in for sluggish growth for a long time to come.

From NASA Goddard, something reminiscent of last year’s blocking high for the heat wave in Russia.
NASA Satellite Observes Unusually Hot July in the Great Plains
Andrey Savtchenko and Adam Voiland NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
Much of the United States sweated through an unusually humid heat wave during July, a month that brought record-breaking temperatures to many areas across the Great Plains. As temperatures soared, NASA satellites observed the unusual weather from above.
The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), an instrument launched on the Aqua satellite in 2002, is unique in its ability to yield highly accurate data about the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere and the part that most directly affects life on Earth.
Hot temperatures struck Texas and Oklahoma particularly hard, AIRS observed. Large swaths of both of these states persistently experienced highs above 100° F (311 K) during the day for the month of July. Nights offered only minimal relief with low temperatures averaging close to 90° F (305 K) for the month. That’s about 20° F warmer, both day and night, than the average July temperatures for the past eight years of AIRS observations.
  Night and day time temperatures during July were significantly warmer than has been typical over the last eight years. As seen in the top graphic, the heat remained anonymously over much of the country at night. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)

AIRS also offered clues about what may have caused the persistent heat spell. Domes of high atmospheric surface pressure (corresponding to the red colors in the figure below) normally intensify in the summer over both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, AIRS data shows they were abnormally strong in July.

  An area of high pressure in the North Atlantic likely helped fuel the heat wave. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)

Meanwhile, AIRS data for the month of July (below) reveals a clock-wise vortex of winds (shown with arrows beow) driven by the high pressure in the North Atlantic. The vortex continuously pumped hot and humid air from the tropics through the heart of the Gulf of Mexico and into much of the continental United States throughout July.
  Note the hot tropical air being pumped towards Texas and Oklahoma. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)

The jet stream, which typically produces loops around low-pressure areas that break off and brings cooler air and precipitation, offered little relief. As seen below, the flow of the jet stream (approximated by green and yellow) instead consistently bulged over the high-pressure aloft over the United States (shown in red).
  Note the unusual bulge in the jet stream over the center of the country. (Credit: NASA/Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Center)

"**Work is set to begin on one of the UK's largest energy retrofit projects of its kind.**
The scheme will see almost 650 existing homes in Penderry, Swansea, installed with energy storage and smart energy management technology.
Social housing provider Pobl is behind the project, which is backed by Â£3.5m in European Union funding.
Housing Minister Julie James hailed it as ""transformational"".
It is hoped the upgrades will allow the homes to generate up to 60% of their own electricity, reducing bills and carbon emissions by as much 350 tonnes per year.
Local resident Brian Mcallen took part in a smart energy pilot scheme and welcomed news of the roll-out to the wider community.
""It allows people to really see how green energy works and how much money they can save to use elsewhere. It can be a real eye-opener,"" he said.
Individual or communal batteries will be installed for the homes, allowing them to harness power generated via linked solar panels.
Every home will also be fitted with a new smart thermostat and intelligent heating control, managed through an app.
Work will begin in the new year.
""Fuel prices and climate change are two sides of the same crisis, with people in Wales still among the most fuel-poor in the UK,"" said Solitaire Pritchard, Pobl's head of regeneration.
""We are committed to identifying new ways of making homes more environmentally and financially sustainable - and that includes our existing homes as well as our new developments.""
The project has been delivered in collaboration with renewable energy supplier Sero.
Lessons learned it from will inform the wider roll-out of renewable energy technology in thousands of homes throughout the Swansea Bay City Region, as part of the Â£1.3bn City Deal, in the Homes as Power Stations project - subject to UK and Welsh Government approval.
This would see energy efficiency technology retrofitted to 7,000 homes with a further 3,300 new build homes also benefiting as part of the project, which is led by Neath Port Talbot council.
In July, housing bodies called for thousands of existing homes in Wales to be retro-fitted with energy-saving improvements to create jobs as part of the economic recovery from coronavirus."
"Not In My Back Yard, or NIMBY-ism as it is known, is one thing, but the prospect of fracking for shale gas in rock deep underground has thrown up a new type of protest: Not Under My Back Yard. Following unsolicited drilling for oil under his property, Mohammed Al Fayed brought a case in 2010 claiming a fraction of the extraction proceeds. Under UK law, all mineral rights belong to the Crown for it to licence, and the case was thrown out, but a small fine was levied against the drillers for trespass. This has led to NUMBY-ism, where land owners, despite having no ownership of the oil, gas, or mineral resources under their land, make efforts to prevent exploitation deep under their property. This seems odd, especially to those in cities. With London in particular, many new infrastructure projects such as Crossrail run just a few tens of metres below thousands of domestic and commercial properties. In densely populated areas, negotiating with each and every property owner would make these projects unmanageable, and the benefits of more and better public transport would not be felt. This transport infrastructure that carries passengers from the country to the city and within it benefits rural and urban dwellers alike; why shouldn’t the same hold in the countryside?  Whether or not a land or property owner has a direct interest in exploring for shale gas or preventing it, the current proposals focus on compensation – drilling companies must pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to communities affected – rather than permission. With the potential for court cases brought by NUMBYs to prevent drillers from getting to work, the government plans to make provisions that change the definition of trespass – part of the Infrastructure Bill mentioned in the Queen’s Speech, with details awaiting the outcome of consultation. Firms – or at least one, Cuadrilla – are now submitting drilling applications to local county councils to recommence fracking in earnest. With high levels of truck movements for a year or more, fracking is noisy and invasive to the immediate area around the well. During this time a considerable amount of water must be sourced and blasted deep below the surface, up to two miles down, at high pressure to free the gas from the shale rock. Much of this will flow back, bringing residues with it. And on top of this drillers must ensure the borehole captures the gas without letting it escape around the well, especially at shallow depths where it could contaminate the water table. It’s time we found out whether these risks can be managed. The possible disturbance from earthquakes, which stopped Cuadrilla’s Lancashire drilling last time, are a greater risk to the borehole infrastructure itself than to the local community, and so the driller has the greatest incentives to minimise them. The challenges of not just drilling but drilling safely have not been taken lightly and concerns are still key to the choice of drilling location. But the site is still key, and should allow access to a wide shale bed accessible by horizontal drilling. We can’t allow the rise of NUMBY-ism to prevent this. There are risks to the driller too; once the investment in prospecting and drilling has been borne, the quantity of gas from the shale bed may not match expectations. Without a return on investment, there may be no future investment. For a limited number of sample wells and from as small a number of plots as possible, if the gas flow is insufficient then few if any new fields would be progressed. The communities that experienced the drilling could be compensated for their disruption, and the drillers would simply pack up and leave. With North Sea oil and gas declining, the UK needs another comparable energy source if it is not to become more dependent on imported energy or face volatile and rising prices. If successful, the energy consumer and tax payer will benefit as well as the gas producer who takes considerable investment risk. Ultimately the greatest risk is not doing anything to ensure a continued energy supply. We need to gather results now from a sufficient number of wells to resolve if shale gas can make a substantial contribution to the UK’s energy position or not, and that means removing some of the barriers that currently prevent it."
"**Americans have been holding subdued celebrations for Thanksgiving, as the country grapples with its coronavirus epidemic - one of the world's worst.**
Some traditions have continued, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, which was closed to spectators.
Many have also travelled home to celebrate the holiday, despite warnings from health officials.
More than three million people are reported to have travelled through US airports from Friday to Sunday in what was the busiest travel weekend since the outbreak began in mid-March.
But the number is around half the usual figure for Thanksgiving travel, and many people have opted out of seeing friends and family for the holiday.
Many still managed to mark the occasion in different ways.
For those living in sunnier climes, it was a bit easier to socialise outdoors.
Thanksgiving, which sees Americans gather with their families for festivities on a scale rivalling Christmas, falls on the fourth Thursday of November. This year is the holiday's 400th anniversary.

"Last year Japanese scientists announced they had for the first time extracted gas from offshore deposits of methane hydrate, an ice-like substance made of natural gas (methane) trapped inside water crystals.  For resource-poor Japan, which must import most of its fossil fuel supply, this could be a route to much-needed energy security, and was hailed as major breakthrough. And with potentially huge reserves of methane hydrates found in deposits around the world, depending on the technology and the need, methane hydrate could be the next important “unconventional” fossil fuel to arrive after shale gas. Methane hydrate deposits form and remain stable only under high pressure or low temperatures, such as in areas of permafrost, or beneath the pressure of hundreds of metres of water at the bottom of the ocean. The methane that it contains is usually formed by the work of tiny microbes that consume organic material buried in seafloor sediments. Sometimes the methane has a deeper origin, from the breakdown of organic material cooked at the high temperatures that occur several kilometres down in the Earth’s crust, in a similar process to the formation of oil. Once formed, it slowly percolates up through the rock towards the surface. Because there is a generous supply of organic material to regions of the deep seafloor close to the continents, these regions are believed to contain very large amounts of methane hydrate. It’s very difficult to determine an accurate estimate for the actual amount of methane hydrate lying in the oceans. The hydrate is commonly present in a distributed form, either occupying cracks in the sedimentary rocks beneath the seabed, or filling parts of the microscopic pore space within the rock. Hydrate may fill only a few percent of the available space.  Methane hydrate’s physical properties are very different from the salty water that normally fills these spaces. We can estimate some of these properties, such as sound speed or electrical resistivity, by conducting geophysical surveys. However, our surveying methods normally average these properties over volumes that are tens to hundreds of metres across, and on this scale the effect of the hydrate can be quite subtle and hard to recognise. Only a tiny fraction of the seafloor has been surveyed by these methods, so the most reliable estimates of global methane hydrate resources come from computer models. Based on estimates of the amount of organic matter present in seafloor sediments, these models make predictions of how much methane might be generated and converted to methane hydrates. When hydrates were first discovered in the oceans in the 1970s, it was thought that they might be the dominant form of organic carbon on Earth, and a much larger resource than conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. But as surveying techniques and our understanding of how methane hydrates form has improved, more recent estimates have steadily declined to below the total amount of fossil fuels. Most recent estimates are around 1,000 gigatonnes or less of carbon bound in methane. Nevertheless, hydrates probably still constitute a substantial reserve of natural gas and their resource potential has led to several nations, including the US, Japan, China, India, South Korea and Taiwan, launching large-scale hydrate exploration programmes.  Geophysical surveys are effective at estimating hydrate volumes in those areas where it is more concentrated, particularly when complemented by direct sampling in boreholes. A tell-tale sign of the presence of hydrate is the so-called “bottom-simulating reflector” (BSR). Because temperature increases with depth beneath the seafloor, at a certain depth the hydrate becomes unstable, and below this depth the methane is present in gaseous form and affects sound passing through it differently. This boundary is often a strong reflector of sound waves that roughly parallels the seabed and crosses geological structures, so it is a distinctive feature in images constructed from seismic surveys of the seabed. Exploration effort tends to be focused in areas where BSRs have been detected. Even once an accumulation of methane hydrate has been found, putting it to use an energy resource is a considerable challenge. Other than in permafrost regions, which present their own challenging, remote and hostile environment, hydrate is present only in deep water where building structures on the seabed is a significant engineering challenge.  Since it commonly lies beneath many metres of rock, using straightforward mining is not generally practical, and exploiting the gas requires removing it from the solid hydrate. This process requires either an increase in temperature or a reduction in pressure, both of which in turn require energy to achieve. Sometimes nature does the work for us and ocean warming triggers the release of gas, as may be happening near the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. But such natural release tends to be too widely distributed to be collected easily. So the technological challenge that Japan and others face is to extract the gas and transport it to somewhere it can be used. On top of that already substantial scientific and engineering task, ideally some way of collecting and storing the resultant carbon emissions from burning the gas as energy and putting them into permanent storage is required, perhaps back under the sea floor.  For methane hydrates to be worth exploiting, all of this needs to be possible without using more energy than can be extracted from the methane, else the entire operation cannot be financially viable. And while surveying techniques aimed at locating methane hydrate deposits have improved, we are still – despite Japan’s efforts – some way from making methane hydrates pay for themselves."
"The Amazon rainforest has been home to the Achuar people for thousands of years. Skilled hunters and fishermen, they have a spiritual connection with nature and consider themselves the forest’s greatest protectors. Life is governed by their ancestors, with family history passed down orally from generation to generation. Yet traditions are being undermined as the young are tempted away by modernity, while their fragile ecosystem faces man-made destruction.  But now, the same technological developments so often deemed a threat to traditional ways of life, have offered the Achuar people, and other remote tribal people, the opportunity to preserve their legacy and fight back against the eradication of their histories. A team from the global genealogy website MyHeritage has been spending time with groups like the Achuar in an attempt to preserve their family heritage. Entsakua Yunkar, shaman of the Achuar Sharamentsa community in Ecuador, said the project was helping to assuage his fears that “history can disappear” very quickly.  “I feel like the father of this community,” Yunkar said. “If I don’t exist here, this community can’t have power and be successful. I feel that I give positive energy to the communities and families here. “The big trees are my grandparents. They speak to me. I feel very sad when I think about what will happen in a long time. The world is changing. Our goal is to protect this area and our culture so it will be alive for many years.” The very existence of tribal communities around the world is threatened by a whole host of factors. Imported diseases, such as influenza, measles and chickenpox, can prove deadly when tribespeople have not had the chance to develop any immunity, according to Survival International, the global charity for tribal people’s rights. Deforestation and climate change are also huge threats, while technology and modernity risk destroying communities by luring younger members away to urban regions. The genealogy project is the brainchild of Golan Levi, a qualified architect who earlier in his career spent years creating giant sculptures with tribes around the world. “I heard fascinating stories [during his time as an architect],” he said. “They had a history of oral tradition, but they didn’t have a means to preserve their heritage. “The oral tradition keeps the essence of their communities but they’re losing the pieces. They might know the meaning behind a ceremony but they wouldn’t be able to tell you the name of their great great grandparents. “When I started working at MyHeritage I realised it was the perfect fit to document those stories.” The group’s first project was with the Himba people of Namibia in 2015, with subsequent delegations visiting the Nenets in Siberia, the Emberá, Ngäbe, Naso and Guna in Panama, and several tribes in Papua New Guinea. “Everything varies from tribe to tribe … but family and how they collaborate with each other is key,” said Levi. He explains the groups have initially been met with scepticism, but their willingness to muck in breaks down barriers with the tribespeople, who eventually agree to be photographed, filmed and interviewed. “It takes time to build trust,” he adds. “We live as they live in order to understand how they view the world and this is something they greatly appreciate.” Franklin Wasump, an Achuar who hails from the Wayusentsa community, echoed Entsakua Yunkar’s concerns about his culture disappearing. “In many years the Achuar culture may disappear, as happened with other nationalities, because there are many young people that don’t want to preserve the culture,” he said. “I am sad because although today it is still preserved, in the future it might not. “It is the responsibility of the father to teach, to talk to the young children in order not to lose the culture.” Yampia Santi, an Achuar leader from the Wayusentsa community, said he hoped the project would raise awareness. “The Achuar tribe will be around for many more generations, which is why we ask you tell your friends about the rainforest and the Achuar people who live there.”"
"

Matthew Hooton nails it once again.



For those still committed to reality-based politics, Ardern’s “year of delivery” is as credible as her earlier promise to be “transformational”.  
KiwiBuild, the Billion Trees programme and the Provincial Growth Fund handing out only 3 per cent of the money Shane Jones has paraded are the most risible.  
More seriously, Ardern appointed herself Minister for Child Poverty Reduction and declared it the reason she entered politics, yet by some measures it has worsened. 



Beneficiary numbers and state-house waiting lists are up, with just 656 new state houses completed in 2018/19, compared with 1043, 466 and 732 over the previous three years.  
The promise to deliver a Wellbeing Budget based on the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework turned out to be a hoax, with Grant Robertson putting his Budget together in exactly the same way as his predecessors. His decision to increase the Government’s debt limit by $16 billion suggests Steven Joyce was right, pre-election, to talk about a $12b fiscal hole. 



That is a stunning list of non delivered items, don’t you think?



Immigration from countries other than Australia is as high as ever, still above 100,000 a year, a massive number for a country of just 5 million people with already failing infrastructure.  
At least in Auckland, there is no bold programme to address that infrastructure deficit, with vast bureaucratic effort going into analysing vanity projects like the airport tram rather than radically expanding the existing rail system and optimising the roading network. 



On climate change — which Ardern called her generation’s “nuclear-free moment” — spin continues to trump substance, with agriculture potentially going into the Emissions Trading Scheme but with 95 per cent subsidies. Who knew Ardern’s climate “emergency” could be solved by dairy farmers paying just 1c per kilogram of milk solids?  
As yet, no decisions have been made on reforming water allocation rights and cleaning up lakes and rivers. Plans for a water tax have gone the same way as Michael Cullen’s capital gains tax. 



Well, for once, I am glad about something this government has done… or technically not done, as it looked like they were was going to trash our economy completely by strangling the agricultural sector. Now it might take them 2 terms to wreck the economy instead of just one.



In contrast to Chris Finlayson’s cracking pace, Andrew Little has signed just three Treaty of Waitangi deeds of settlement and made no progress with Ngapuhi. No human remains will ever be recovered from Pike River, whatever Little tells the families. 



This was always a lie of outrageous proportions, with the Pike River families being used as political footballs all the way through the ordeal. The West Coast gets what it deserves though… these guys always, always vote Labour.



**On ethical issues such as complying with the Official Information Act, answering parliamentary questions and managing conflicts of interest, the Ardern ministry has complied with the maxim that each Government is worse than the one before.**



No, Matthew, they are the most open and transparent government of all time… and also the most skillful with a black felt pen… 



Ardern may cultivate a brand of almost naive sincerity but those around her are at least as cynical as those around John Key.  
They know it will be enough for Ardern to take to social media to declare the year of delivery a triumph and to thank New Zealanders for making it happen. “The Government didn’t do this alone!” the Prime Minister will gush. “We all did this together!”  
 **It will be amplified by those in the traditional media for whom challenging Ardern’s narrative remains verboten. Those who break the taboo will be criticised for not embracing the vibe. Such negativity, her cheerleaders will tell us, is not who we are now.**



For those who criticise National and their inability to tear the government to shreds, the next paragraph gives us an inkling into how tough it can be.



In the post-truth era, the Opposition pointing out the sheer emptiness of the Prime Minister’s utterances will achieve no more than the Washington Post frantically fact-checking Trump’s. **If Simon Bridges challenges the Prime Minister’s account, he will be ridiculed for looking angry.**





That is happening already, with National being accused of heresy for questioning the value of declaring ‘climate emergencies’. These guys cannot win in the current environment.



Good on Matthew Hooton for calling out the government’s woeful performance to date, but he is a lone voice. Over on _Stuff_ , on the same day, we have the inevitable puff piece from Tracy Watkins…



Baby [Neve Te Aroha Gayford](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/parenting/113674411/its-neve-te-aroha-ardern-gayfords-first-birthday) is crawling around the floor of her parents’ Sandringham bungalow when she discovers the big fluffy microphone in our video operator’s bag. She grabs it before her famous mum can stop her and starts making “woof woof” noises.  




“There are obvious limitations to what I’m able to do as a first time mum. And that’s something that actually I just had to accept. There’s no point dwelling on that too much.”  
The limitations Ardern refers to are “just not being around” for Neve as much as she would like.  
“Some days I’ll only see Neve once (a day). Sometimes I won’t see her at all. Sometimes I won’t see her for a couple of days. 



  
Personally, I am sick to death of a sycophantic media trying to keep the worst-performing prime minister in living memory in her job by constantly writing these pathetic articles to bolster her public appeal. 



Doesn’t it strike you as worrying that, apart from Matthew Hooton, the rest of the media doesn’t even try to defend the prime minster’s dreadful job performance, but concentrates solely on the fact that she is a first-time mother instead? 



What does that tell you about the quality of our government?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt their blogsite here climatologist (IPCC author) Professor Hans von Storch and cultural scientist Werner Krauss have announced they’ve authored a new book on the topic of climate change, society and policy:

“The Climate Trap – The dangerous proximity of politics and climate science” – Hanser Verlag
The book will be released later this month by Munich publisher Hanser Verlag. A longer excerpt for reading is available here in German.
This is neither a skeptic nor an alarmist book. In it von Storch and Krauss have plenty of harsh criticism for both sides of the debate, and then some. Both sides, they claim, are responsible for having driven the climate issue into the ground. The book, they say, explains how climate science got there in the first place, and what possibilities are left to get climate sciences back on track so that it can produce productive action.
Here are some excerpts of the publisher’s excerpt:
On the state of climate change today, von Storch and Krauss write (my emphasis):

After the unprecedented success story of climate change becoming an object of public attention and concern, climate policy and the accompanying climate debate have wound up in a dead end. Despite the Kyoto Protocol and other agreements, commitments to transform the energy supply, and all the climate summits, there’s been no noteworthy success. To the contrary: The curve depicting global emissions of greenhouse gases has been surging upwards. In the summer of 2012, at the summit Rio +20, katzenjammer was everywhere.”

On the climate debate:

Together with climate politics, the climate sciences have ended up in a credibility crisis. The often-made commitment of limiting the temperature increase to 2°C is scientifically controversial and practically impossible politically. The debate is also being paralyzed by a raging public dispute between alarmists and skeptics. […]
The climate debate is stuck in the mud, the credibility of climate scientists has been cast into doubt, and the policymakers’ ability to act on the issue of climate is minimal. We are sitting in the climate trap.”

Why are we in this trap? Von Storch and Krauss write:

It’s not only incompetent politics, the exaggerations by the media and climate protectors, or the destructive forces of the skeptics that are responsible for the interim failure of climate policy. More responsible is the fact that we failed to understand the problem in its full dimension.”

The authors reveal how they feel about alarmist scientists. Since the early 2000s they felt “something was amiss”.

Was the climate apocalypse really at our doorstep as we could read in the media? Or were they exaggerating in their depiction of the results coming from climate science? […]
The climate scientist [von Storch] had the suspicion that climate science was dragging around a ‘cultural rucksack’ that was influencing the interpretation of the data. The cultural scientist [Krauss], with regards to the appearances by some climate scientists in the media and the roles they were readily assigned, was reminded of weather-wizards and shamans of foreign cultures.”

In the book, the authors even describe climate science as a ‘tribe of scientists’ and how some began behaving like prophets:

Some climate scientists were regular interview-partners and talkshow guests – and thus self-confidence became bigger, to the point that they knew the truth about climate change and thus became convinced that policy-making and society should follow the deeper insight of science.”
Without really being aware of it, climate scientists had taken over the role of prophets: They predicted the imminent end-of-the-world if society did not fundamentally change soon, reduced its emissions, and behaved more sustainably with the environment. The problem was not only the message, but also that they were were often completely way in over their heads with the role as mediator between nature and society.”

These “prophets” put out a story that was too much to handle. Von Storch and Krauss write:

Science delivered the raw material for a big climate narrative, one that still continues to shape our perception and media depiction of climate change today. It unleashed the horror scenarios of the Cold War and the fear of the atom, conveying them into the 21st century. A narrative seeded in the world by climate scientists, and one that keeps going out of their control again and again.”

The authors tell us that the way out of the “climate trap” is to begin by “viewing climate change as an issue that does not hang over us like ominous writing on the wall, but as one that has an appropriate place in our societies.” Krauss and von Storch are telling us: “Cool it!” They propose a third, alternative way.
If the rest of the book is like the beginning, then it will have the potential to change the direction of the climate discussion in Germany for the better. It’ll be near the top of my birthday wishlist.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows to me is absolutely stunning. I don’t recall the US government officials and military persons responsible for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki being brought to trials in Nuremberg. Controversial? Maybe for some. But to put Hiroshima on the same level as Auschwitz?

Excerpt from the PIK press release.
Hat/tip a reader.
Obviously Schellnhuber knows no scruples when it comes to promoting his alarmist brand of climate science.
Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, is the direct personal advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel on the “urgent” climate issue. This is a slap to the face of the allied forces who sacrificed so much to liberate the world from the horrible tyranny of the time.

Surely it cannot be the position of the German government to have itself advised by persons with such beliefs.
Some years ago, the brown neo-Nazis in the Saxony Parliament called the bombing of Dresden near the end of WWII a “Bomben-Holocaust“, to which there rightfully was a swift and harsh reaction from politicians, media and citizens.
Schellnhuber’s Hiroshima-Auschwitz press release is no better and deserves the same reaction.
Welcome to the real face of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
The online Potsdam PNN here/ has the original quote from Schellnhuber (h/t Bernd Felsche):
Conscience, Schellnhuber says with regards to the unanswered questions concerning climate science, does not need absolute certainty: ‘In a world where Hiroshima and Auschwitz happened, I can’t trust that everything will always turn out well.'”

==========================================
What Should We Do About CO2 Emissions?
By Ed Caryl
So, what should we do about CO2 emissions? The answer is: nothing. The evidence that Co2 is harmful, that it is raising the earth’s temperature dramatically, has been largely fabricated, and at the least, overblown. Surprisingly, when all the facts are in, CO2 is beneficial! It is an essential trace gas, and a fertilizer. The current increase has boosted growth rates of vegetation worldwide by 13 to 15% (see here).
CO2 is used as a supplement in greenhouses. In a closed greenhouse, growth slows or stops if the plants use it up and CO2 drops below 200 ppm as the plants absorb it. CO2 supplement systems are sold to greenhouse farmers to supply supplemental CO2. Levels up to 1000 ppm or more are often used (see here). Extra CO2 also reduces a plant’s need for water by closing the leaf stomata (see here). Leaf stomata are the ports on the lower side of a leaf that lets plants breath.
One of the most important crops in the world is rice. Studies have been done on Co2 enhancing rice production. If CO2 is increased 200 ppm above the current levels, (which have already increased production by the 13 to 15% cited above) production will increase by another 13 to 15% (see here and here).
Here is an illustration of growth over a range of CO2 levels:

Rice and a wild grass that is the antecedent of Foxtail Millet. Source: Susanne von Caemmerer, W. Paul Quick, and Robert T. Furbank (2012). The Development of C4 Rice: Current Progress and Future Challenges. Science 336 (6089): 1671-1672.
C3 and C4 refers to the chemical pathway used by the chlorophyll in plant leaves to produce sugar. C4 plants include many grasses and corn. It has been argued that C4 plants are immune to changes in CO2, but as you can see in the illustration above, this is clearly not true. They just don’t respond as dramatically as C3 plants. They do, however, become more drought tolerant due to the stomata response reducing water vapor loss.
Plants need 3 major inputs to grow: water, CO2, and nitrogen. From these they produce sugar for energy and proteins and cellulose for structure. Some have argued that increased CO2 produces protein-poor plants. This is true only if increased nitrogen is not supplied along with the increased CO2. A plant needs both in balance. Any greenhouse farmer knows this. But still, this increased growth with increasing CO2 assumes no improvement from fertilization, genetic engineering or plant breeding.
The experiments have been done holding all factors except CO2 constant. That increase from CO2 alone is about 100 million metric tons for each 15% increase in yield per year. That feeds about 700 million more people if one assumes 150 kg of rice per person per year. Imagine the gain if additional fertilizer was supplied along with the increase in CO2. Wheat production with double the current levels of CO2 increased by up to 38 percent (see here). Corn responds to elevated CO2 by needing less water (see here). It is clear that CO2 increases will greatly improve our ability to feed a growing world population.
If we try to limit CO2, we will dramatically limit the economic growth of the world with no effect on the climate. This is already happening in Europe. Taxing CO2 in efforts to limit production of it only makes money for the Al Gore’s of the world. It limits our use of the energy we need for economic growth and the CO2 that our crops need to flourish. Limiting CO2, even if we could, would literally mean the starvation of a billion people in the next 50 years.
What is more important? Feeding and lifting most of the world from poverty orr preventing a questionable slight temperature rise which would lengthen the growing season? The Global Warming crowd is trying to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

"**Hospitals in England could become ""overwhelmed"" with Covid cases if MPs do not back new restrictions, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said.**
Many Tory MPs oppose the tougher tier system, which begins on 2 December.
But writing in the Times, Mr Gove said MPs - who will vote on the measures next week - need to ""take responsibility for difficult decisions"".
Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the new restrictions.
It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury.
It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.
When England's four-week national lockdown ends on Wednesday, regions will be placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
Some MPs say the new system imposes tight restrictions on numerous areas with low cases, and are calling instead for a more localised approach.
But Mr Gove has defended the new system, saying that, unless action to slow the spread of coronavirus is taken, the NHS could be ""broken"" and hospitals ""physically overwhelmed"".
""The tiers we had in place before the lockdown had not suppressed [Covid] sufficiently: they were neither strong enough to reduce social contact sufficiently, nor applied widely enough to contain the virus's spread,"" he wrote.
He added that, across the UK, about 16,000 beds are filled with Covid-19 patients, compared to a peak in April of almost 20,000 and a low of 740 on 11 September.
""When the country is facing such a national crisis, the truth is that all of us who have been elected to Parliament, not just ministers, must take responsibility for difficult decisions,"" he said.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions \- which are not yet finalised - in the run up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is among those questioning England's approach.
On Friday, he asked ""what was the point of lockdown"" if England ends up with tighter restrictions than it had before the four-week national restrictions came into force.
Several Conservative MPs have asked to see the data the government based its decision on.
Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Here in Dorset, we entered lockdown with pretty low figures. We're coming out of it with even lower figures.
""This last week we've gone down by a third. So we're really surprised to find ourselves in tier two.""
Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay, who represents South Thanet, which has the second highest rate of infection in the UK, said he will vote against the new ""draconian"" tiered restrictions.
He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think once areas see themselves going in the wrong direction, that actually has a very, very distinct affect on people's behaviour.""
""They almost self-regulate, they actually do take those space, hands, and all of those good things far more seriously.""
But epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, whose advice led to the decision to go into the first lockdown, told Today: ""I know people argue: 'well why are we going into more intensive measures now after lockdown than we were before?'
""And it's because we don't want to repeat the same mistakes made before this current lockdown and allow cases to rise exponentially again coming into Christmas - particularly in the context that we are going to have a relaxation over Christmas, which does pose some risks.""
NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast those who run hospitals are ""worried about the fact that if those rules are too loose and if people go beyond them"" that ""could trigger a third phase"".
He said the MPs making policy decisions are ""not epidemiologists, they're not experts about exactly what is the balance between loosening the restrictions and what might then follow - that's for the scientific experts, the epidemiologists"".
""The real problem is January is always the NHS' busiest time of year and therefore it is really important that people not only observe the rules,"" he said.
On staffing in hospitals, he said it only takes a ""very, very small amount of sickness in particular areas"" among health workers to result in a ""pretty major problem"".
""If you have a single anaesthetist who is off, then that means 15, 20 other people who are meant to be doing an operation for somebody - that affects their work,"" he said.
The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people will be banned from mixing with other households indoors.
The tiers areas are in will be reviewed every 14 days, starting 16 December.
Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up:
Gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers. People in all tiers who can work from home, should continue to do so.
Pubs in tier two can only open to serve ""substantial meals"", while those in tier three can only operate as a takeaway or delivery service.
Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds will urge Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the Additional Restrictions Grant (ARG) in tier three areas following concerns the new rules will force some local authorities to stretch the grants further than others.
Leaders in Lancashire have written to the PM's interim chief of staff saying it is ""unfair"" that areas facing four weeks of restrictions under the lockdown received the same amount as they did for seven weeks.
The one-off ARG funding equates to Â£20 per person in an area and is designed to help closed businesses that do not directly pay business rates, as well as those that do not have to close but are affected by restrictions.
Ms Dodds is due to tell the party's online regional conference - Connected North West - on Saturday afternoon: ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to leave tier three areas in the lurch like this again.""
A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said ""a host of other support measures"" have been made available."
"What a difference a year makes. This time in 2018 the long hot summer was weeks away. Saddleworth Moor was not yet on fire. Greta Thunberg’s climate strike had not begun, let alone brought millions onto the streets. The IPCC’s 1.5 degree report had not been released (and most thought it would sink without trace). Extinction Rebellion was unheard of outside a tiny group of committed environmentalists. And now look where we are. Local authorities across the UK are declaring climate emergencies (the latest is Birmingham). The UK parliament declared a climate emergency in April, and now, prime minister Theresa May, in legacy mode, has declared that the country will have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means for every gram of greenhouse gas emitted – mostly from burning fossil fuels – an equivalent amount must be removed from the atmosphere, via speculative technologies such as “Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage” or Direct Air Capture. To do this, May has ignored the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s warning that a 2050 target could cost £1 trillion (the two don’t get on). But what does it all mean, and what is to be done? As always, it pays to read the fine print. A month ago, the Committee on Climate Change released a major report on when the UK could reach a zero-carbon target, and recommended a target of 2050. My colleague Joe Blakey and I argued that the report was simply not ambitious enough, was silent on consumption-based emissions accounting and only includes international aviation and maritime emissions from 2033.  Most of all, a 2050 target completely disregards the UK’s historical emissions responsibility – in the Global South the damage is already being felt. (The short version – it’s much less risky for ourselves, future generations and other species if we miss a really ambitious target by a couple of years than reach an unambitious one “safely”.) The government’s announcement will essentially enshrine the report’s 2050 target recommendation in law. Yet May’s declaration still has loopholes – for instance, as Greenpeace has noted, it allows the use of international carbon credits which will “shift the burden to developing nations”. Meanwhile, expanding Heathrow (or any airport) sends exactly the wrong signal about the kinds of changes which will be needed. Business as usual is simply not an option. Even electric airplanes, if they emerge, will make only a very minor dent in Heathrow’s emissions which are largely from long-haul flights, beyond the scope of putative electric aircraft. If the UK were serious it would now abandon fracking, which according to respected academics is not compatible with the UK’s climate targets. Even Lord Browne, ex-head of BP and more recently chair of the fracking company Cuadrilla, recently conceded “fracking in the UK doesn’t make much sense”. “Traditional” fossil fuel extraction also really has to end soon: Greenpeace activists are right now trying to stop a BP oil rig bound for the North Sea. We’ve had over 30 years of warm words about climate change, all the way back to Margaret Thatcher addressing the Royal Society in September 1988. If warm words prevented global warming, I wouldn’t be writing this article. So, if we want a different outcome, we need different actions. Business people are going to have to actually do that thing – innovation – that they keep talking about. Innovation in how we eat, how we heat houses, move people, and so on. Politicians should also be telling the truth. Here in Manchester, where I am based, a recent Freedom of Information Act request showed that the city’s leaders have been remarkably silent on climate change over the past two years. Mostly, though, concerned citizens have to realise that fixing climate change is a process, not a series of events (what I call an emotacycle). If they want the bold pronouncements of 2019 to mean something through the 2020s and beyond, they need to start engaging with the nitty gritty of political scrutiny structures, lobbying, chivvying, probing, demanding, urging. Without that, the bureaucratic, psychological and institutional inertia will win out, as it has for the past 30 years. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"It may come as a surprise to discover that it is perfectly legal in the UK to keep primates, such as marmosets, loris, capuchins or squirrel monkeys, as pets. Perhaps more surprising still is that there is no requirement to register or (in some cases) hold a licence for such exotic creatures. The UK Parliament’s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee has published a report that examines the current situation – but does not call for a ban on primate keeping, despite acknowledging that it was the recommendation of the majority of those giving evidence. Bans on keeping primates have been introduced in a number of coutries including Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Australia and some US states. Clearly, the keeping of primates as pets is a hotly contested area. Many people would argue that keeping primates in captivity should be banned entirely. They are after all wild animals, not to be kept for the pleasure of the public. They have complex needs, including social interaction and a varied diet and environment. On the other hand, some hold that zoos, which provide education, conservation and welfare services in the keeping of primates, are justified in maintaining captive populations, while private owners are not.  This argument risks creating an artificial divide that implies that zoos are better places for primates to be kept than in private hands, if they must be kept in captivity at all. From my own experience conducting research in zoos, it is clear that zoo life is never so black and white.  Keepers often work tirelessly for the benefit of the animals, trying to balance the welfare needs of the animals against the wants of the public and the constant limitations of money, time and space. The outcomes may not always be ideal, but this is done out in the public eye, and in the UK, under the guidance of BIAZA, the organisation that represents the role of zoos and aquariums in promoting education, conservation and welfare. But for primates kept as pets, there is no equivalent body to represent the needs of these animals, no animal registry or licence required, and no one to inspect and ensure they are properly cared for.  In the UK, primate keeping must comply with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, and also follow the “Primate Code”, introduced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in 2010 as a guide to the needs of captive primates kept in private collections. The code is a guide to the primates’ social, environmental and physical needs that have a direct impact on their welfare, and how owners should meet these needs. It is due for review in 2015, and this has prompted the committee to produce this study on how best to address some of the monitoring and welfare issues of privately held primates, and how best to improve primates’ welfare. The problem is not that primates kept in private collections are necessarily badly cared for, but that no one really has any idea how many are kept, where, and in what conditions. Estimates range from anywhere between 1,000 and 20,000 primates, and there is no clear information about which species are kept as pets. The guidelines provided in the code are specific neither to the pet owner (individual, zoo, circus), nor the species of animal. This latter point is particularly important, given that the rise in demand from the pet trade for exotic animals is causing increasing problems for maintaining viable populations of threatened species in the wild. This also makes revising the Primate Code challenging: it is impossible to provide species-specific advice for primate carers, as the report recommends, without prior knowledge of which species people own.  The difficulties begin even with definition of the term “pet”. It is defined in the report as an animal, “kept alone in domestic settings, primarily for the purpose of companionship or personal interest”. On the other hand the report acknowledges that Defra has previously stated that to keep a primate in a domestic setting, even when not caged, would be likely to breach the Animal Welfare Act, due to their complex social needs. As a solution, the report suggests that primate owners be required to register their pets, which would at least provide information on who owns what that is so far missing. This is the first and most important step that can be made towards improving guidelines and legislation to monitor the trade. In addition, a more comprehensive licensing system is proposed, which would allow tighter regulation and easier tracking of primates in the pet trade.  While this initial step seems promising, the bigger debate still remains: whether implementing a ban on keeping primates as pets is necessary, and whether it would be effective. One of the arguments against a ban asserts that it is “arrogant” to assume that zoos can care for primates better than private collectors. But without more accurate data on the current state of private primate collections, there’s no basis for this claim. Better information would certainly help to counter claims that a complete ban is baseless, and to address issues of cost.  While many of these arguments against the ban consider the effects on humans, it’s notable that those in favour of a ban consider the outcomes on the animals. A primate trade ban in the UK could have a positive impact on conservation efforts and welfare – and this is the approach we need, one that centres on the needs of the primates. Underlying this report, the question remains: for what reason do we need to keep primates in captivity? The only answer should be for the good of their species, not ours."

Share this...FacebookTwitterParts of European academia have obviously lost their marbles, as one apparently crazed professor has called for the death penalty for people who disagree with the IPCC dogma. Call it an interesting case of budding extreme fanaticism.

University of Graz professor calls for the death penalty for people who question the IPCC.
========================================
Dire tones from the University of Graz: music professor calls for the death penalty for climate science dissenters
By Dr Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Over the last 30 years huge progress has been made in natural and environmental protection. Exhaust today is being intensively scrubbed, waste-water is being cleaned and energy is being used ever more efficiently. We can consider ourselves fortunate to be living in a time and place where environmental hazards today are hardly a threat to the population.
But what started as a successful and well intentioned environmental movement, now appears to have careened totally out of control. The movement has not done itself any favors by hitching itself to the ideologically led fight against the supposed climate catastrophe. The climate catastrophe scenarios announced 10 years ago by a very convinced IPCC have not come to pass. In stark contradiction to the theoretical prognoses, global temperatures have not risen in 16 years. Over the last decade, the sea level rise has not accelerated, and weather extremes are well within the range of natural variability. A look at the real, measured data and the paleo-climatological reconstructions tells us there is no alarm.
Unfortunately, many media representatives have been unable to depart from their long-loved climate catastrophe. Catastrophes are interesting for readers, viewers and audiences, and they boost ratings and circulation. How on earth would the otherwise empty pages and radio shows be filled if the catastrophe disappeared? As we have been able to show in numerous analyses of recent media reports on the topic of climate at this blog, media reporting is often one-sided, tends to be and is even at times plainly false.
Many media reports would not stand up to any serious scientific review. Sensitized scientists are fortunately in a position to identify the deceit and confusion. Unfortunately many scientifically uneducated people lack the means to check over the science and simply accept the media reports as the truth. Some individuals even allow themselves to be so impressed by the dubious reports that, in their fear of the climate catastrophe, they actually adopt insane beliefs.

Unfortunately one of these people is Richard Parncutt, an Australian professor at the University of Graz. At his university website he seriously calls for “climate deniers” to be punished with the death penalty or life in prison. At his website the following appeared (emphasis added):
In this article I am going to suggest that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for influential GW [global warming] deniers. But before coming to this surprising conclusion, please allow me to explain where I am coming from.
Even mass murderers should not be executed, in my opinion. Consider the politically motivated murder of 77 people in Norway in 2011. Of course the murderer does not deserve to live, and there is not the slightest doubt that he is guilty. But if the Norwegian government killed him, that would just increase the number of dead to 78. It would not bring the dead back to life. In fact, it would not achieve anything positive at all. I respect the families and friends of the victims if they feel differently about that. I am simply presenting what seems to me to be a logical argument.
GW deniers fall into a completely different category from Behring Breivik. They are already causing the deaths of hundreds of millions of future people. We could be speaking of billions, but I am making a conservative estimate.
[…]
If a jury of suitably qualified scientists estimated that a given GW denier had  already, with high probability (say 95%), caused the deaths of over one million future people, then s/he would be sentenced to death. The sentence would then be commuted to life imprisonment if the accused admitted their mistake, demonstrated genuine regret, AND participated significantly and positively over a long period in programs to reduce the effects of GW (from jail) – using much the same means that were previously used to spread the message of denial. At the end of that process, some GW deniers would  never admit their mistake and as a result they would be executed. Perhaps that would be the only way to stop the rest of them. The death penalty would have been justified in terms of the enormous numbers of saved future lives.
The original page at the University of Graz has been been taken down in the meantime. However copies of the page were first made, for example at webcitation.org, Google Webcache and over at tallbloke. The crazed thinking that Mr. Music Professor here demonstrates is truly frightening. Does he really believe what he is writing or is this pure provocation? Or perhaps it’s a just a nasty hoax, with someone hacking into the university website and slipping in the text? Unlikely. But anything is possible. For Parncutt that would be the best variant, as one does not need to be a psychic to predict that the University of Graz will not simply let this go and that this could have serious personal consequences. It is also unlikely that his colleagues are going to stand up for him. He was never really highly regarded to begin with, as Parncutt himself admits at other locations of the University website.
The media is in a way partly responsible for this. Through their sloppily researched and non-objective articles, radio reports and TV shows, they inflict with their climate alarmism plenty of damage with gullible and emotionally unstable people. It is high time that balanced science finds its way back once again into media reporting, and that the media learn to suppress their zeal for climate alarmism.
Especially in Germany and Austria facts today should count more than ideological convictions.

Part Four:



 **New purpose in the public service**



But let’s be honest, our wellbeing challenges cannot be solved in one Budget – or even ten. Public investment is a powerful lever for change, but it’s only one.



We also need to **embed the idea of wellbeing in the heart of our public service –** how it works, what it prioritises, who joins and leads it.



That is why earlier this year we announced that we would refocus the New Zealand public service to deliver enduring change, more strongly focused on improving the current and future wellbeing of all New Zealanders.



The changes that we are making in New Zealand are not far from many of the key themes identified in the early stages of your ongoing independent review of the Australian public service – including strengthening culture and leadership, increasing flexibility and capability, and **a focus on working collectively** to achieve better outcomes.



This doesn’t mean our current model is broken. In fact, our public service has a strong international reputation for responsiveness to government, effectiveness for New Zealanders, and integrity.



For instance, New Zealand is ranked second overall in 38 countries assessed on central civil service performance in the 2019 International Civil Service Effectiveness Index.



Closer to home, the 2018 Kiwis Count Survey – published only weeks ago – shows New Zealanders have increasing trust in the public service. **Satisfaction with the provision of services is at a record high.**



So why are we embarking on the biggest reforms to the statutory framework of our public service in more than 30 years?



It’s simple. We know we can do better.



We know **we can build a more modern, agile and adaptive public service.** And we know the importance of the constitutional role our public service has in supporting New Zealand’s democratic form of government.



So we are affirming this role – for current and future generations of New Zealanders – in **new legislation.**



Just weeks ago, our Government announced the most **significant changes** to the New Zealand Public Service since the State Sector Act of 1988. **That will be repealed and replaced with a new Public Service Act.** This will underpin a modernising of the Public Service for the good of New Zealanders and make it easier to tackle the biggest challenges facing the Government of the day.



After all, one department dealing with one part of the problem at a time, can’t fix complex issues like breaking the cycle of child poverty and domestic violence, planning for climate change or providing more effective mental health services. They’re issues that don’t fit neatly into a box, and we can only seriously tackle them with a whole-of-government approach where everyone pushes for the same outcome at the same time.



That’s why under the changes, boards, made up of chief executives from relevant government agencies, will be established to tackle cross cutting challenges. These boards, or joint ventures, will be accountable to a single minister and receive direct Budget appropriations. Public servants from across the system will be deployed as required.



One current example of this is the way we are working to prevent and respond to family and sexual violence. This was a major feature of the Wellbeing Budget. Not only did the Government deliver the largest ever investment into this area but we also delivered a new way of working with the initiative being delivered across eight portfolios: Attorney General, Corrections, Courts, Health, Justice, Oranga Tamariki, Police, and Social Development.



But we know we need more than structural changes. As our Minister of State Services Chris Hipkins has said **the shift to a single, unified public service approach will be complemented by cultural change** with the new Act acknowledging that a ‘spirit of service to the community’ is fundamental to the Public Service.



 **A unified public sector around common purpose, principles and values** is crucial and we believe we can encourage that practically by making it easier for public servants to move seamlessly through the public service as a whole.



Building trust also means a strengthened **public service that supports the Government’s commitment** to a stronger Maori/Crown relationship, helping improve outcomes for Maori, the indigenous people of our country.



And **we want a more diverse and inclusive public service workforce** that reflects the communities it serves.



I want to be clear that this is not about a sudden, large-scale system change.



As I said a few minutes ago, New Zealand’s Public Service in good shape. So **changes will be carefully phased and managed over time** , with a legislative process that will run into mid-2020.



In the meantime, we are getting on with a wider work programme.



To take just one example, Public Sector chief executives are **charged with tackling the gender pay gap in the core public service** , which the Government is committed to eliminating.



Substantial progress has been made this Parliamentary term. The public service Gender Pay Gap Action Plan, established in July 2018 includes a focus on:



Women now lead some of the largest public service agencies including our Ministries of Education, Social Development, and Business, Innovation and Employment, Corrections, Treasury, and of course the country.



 **Good government matters in the world**



But all of this is of course part of a much wider goal. Building a public sector than can help build good government. But as is so often the case in this sphere – the buck ultimately starts and stops with us, the politicians.



As leaders globally, we are facing **a rising tide of public suspicion towards government** , a sense that we’ve let the material differences between us stretch beyond fairness, and as a result **there are signs of life in old ideologies.**



But if we begin at home, if we broaden our idea of good government and act with a sense of fairness of guardianship – and even kindness – of what we in New Zealand call manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga – then I absolutely believe we will make headway on these challenges.



But **we won’t succeed unless** we apply these same values **globally.**



For countries like New Zealand and Australia, that means **prioritising international rules and norms t** hat work for all countries.



It means encouraging trade, not retreating behind protectionist barriers – trade that means jobs and livelihoods, but also trade shaped by an open, honest dialogue with our communities.



Here, I do think, Australia and New Zealand can be examples to the world.



We share a strong commitment to the rules-based international trading system that is currently under such strain. I welcome and endorse Prime Minister Morrison’s call for countries to mend, not end, this system and to reject the idea that trade is a zero-sum game.



But we can enhance our expectation of the trade agenda to lift labour and environmental standards and prove that they too can respond to the very issues they’re accused of ignoring.



Times may be challenging but I absolutely believe politics can be a place for change, disruption, and a force for good. Good government need not be an oxymoron.

The molecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus (BTV) since 1998: routes of introduction of different serotypes and individual virus strains. Image: Wikipedia
Farm animal disease to increase with climate change
Researchers looked at changes in the behaviour of bluetongue – a viral disease of cattle and sheep – from the 1960s to the present day, as well as what could happen to the transmission of the virus 40 years into the future. They found, for the first time, that an outbreak of a disease could be explained by changes to the climate.

In Europe, more than 80,000 outbreaks of bluetongue were reported to the World Animal Health Organisation between 1998 and 2010, and millions of animals died as a result of the disease. Bluetongue was previously restricted to Africa and Asia, but its emergence in Europe is thought to be linked to increased temperatures, which allows the insects that carry the virus to spread to new regions and transmit the virus more effectively.
Researchers produced a mathematical model that explains how the risk of an outbreak of bluetongue virus in Europe changes under different climate conditions. The team examined the effect of past climate on the risk of the virus over the past 50 years to understand the specific triggers for disease outbreak over time and throughout geographical regions. This model was then driven forwards in time, using predictive climate models, to the year 2050, to show how the disease may react to future climate change.
Using these future projections, researchers found that in northern Europe there could be a 17% increase in incidence of the bluetongue virus, compared to 7% in southern regions, where it is already much warmer.
Professor Matthew Baylis, from the University’s Institute of Infection and Global Health, said: “Previous study suggests that climate change will alter global disease distribution, and although we have significant knowledge of the climate triggers for particular diseases, more research is needed to identify what we think might really happen in the future.
“We have been able to show that the past emergence of a disease can be explained, in both space and time, by changes to recent climate. These results reinforce the belief that future climate change will threaten our health and well-being by causing infection to spread. Looking forward, this could help inform decision making processes on preparing for disease outbreaks and reduce the huge economic impact that farm animal diseases can have on communities.”
The research is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society Interface.

Good morning, Chairman Bono‐​Mack, Ranking Member Butterfield and members of the subcommittee. I am Daniel Ikenson, associate director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. Today, I am very pleased to be able to share my views on the topic of manufacturing, trade, jobs, and other economic issues related to the subject of today’s hearing. The views I express are my own and should not be construed as representing any official positions of the Cato Institute.



 **Introduction**



Increasing the number of jobs in the economy by expanding trade — both exports and imports — is a good bet. Historically, there has been a strong relationship between economic growth, trade (both exports and imports, individually and combined), and job creation in the United States. In the quarter century between 1983 and 2007, as real GDP more than doubled and the real value of U.S. trade increased five‐​fold, the U.S. economy created 46 million net new jobs, or 1.84 million net new jobs per year.1 In 22 of those 25 years, the annual changes in GDP, trade, and job creation all moved in the same direction — either all positive or all negative. And as economic growth came to a halt and then turned negative in 2008 and 2009, respectively, trade contracted by 12 percent and the economy shed over six million jobs.



Despite the “Made in America” orientation of today’s hearing, it is important to note that trade in products that are made in America, or partially‐​made in America, or designed in America but produced abroad, or entirely designed and produced abroad from components manufactured abroad supports U.S. jobs up and down the supply chain through various channels. Both exports and imports support U.S. jobs.



But many Americans believe that exports are good, imports are bad, the trade account is the scoreboard, the trade deficit means the United States is losing at trade, and it is losing because our trade partners cheat. Many point to the trade deficit as the obvious explanation for the much exaggerated death of U.S. manufacturing. According to polling data, Americans are generally skeptical about trade and its impact on jobs, manufacturing, and the U.S. economy. And why shouldn’t they be? After all, the public is barraged routinely with misleading or simplistic coverage of trade issues by a media that is too often heavy on cliché, innuendo, and regurgitated conventional wisdom, and lacking in substance and analysis.



President Obama has already offered his answer to the question implicit in this hearing. His National Export Initiative aims to double U.S. exports in five years by reducing and eliminating various administrative, regulatory, and financial obstacles faced by U.S. exporters. Although the plan features some laudable components, it includes several errors of omission and commission that are likely to limit or undermine the NEI’s success.



In the pages to follow, this testimony will address and attempt to correct lingering misperceptions about trade and manufacturing, describe some of the shortcomings of the NEI, and offer some alternatives for increasing economic growth and creating jobs through trade.



 **The Myth of Manufacturing Decline**



Americans often hear that some nefarious foreign trade practices are to blame for the decline of U.S. manufacturing. But the problem with that presumption of causation is that U.S. manufacturing is not in decline in the first place. Until the onset of the recent recession (when virtually every sector in the economy contracted), U.S. manufacturing was setting new performance records almost year after year in nearly all relevant statistical categories: profits, revenues, investment returns, output, value added, exports, imports, and others. After contracting during the recession of 2008 and 2009, the manufacturing sector has come roaring back. According to the Institute for Supply Management, economic activity expanded in the manufacturing sector for the 19th consecutive month in February 2011, reaching its highest level since May 2004.2



In absolute terms, the value of U.S. manufacturing has been growing continuously, with brief hiccups experienced during recessions over the past several decades. As a percentage of our total economy, the value of manufacturing peaked in 1953 and has been declining since, but that is the product of rapid growth in the services sectors and not — as evidenced by manufacturing’s absolute growth — an indication of manufacturing decline.3



The preponderance of Chinese and other imported goods on retail store shelves may give the impression that America does not make anything anymore — a fallacy sensationally exploited by ABC News in its recent series, “Made in America.” But U.S. factories make lots of things — in particular, high‐​value products that are less likely to be found in retail stores — like airplanes, advanced medical devices, sophisticated machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology products. American manufacturers are no longer heavily in the business of making sporting goods, tools, clothing, footwear, housewares, and furniture, but their factories are still the world’s most prolific, accounting for 21.4 percent of global manufacturing value‐​added in 2008, while China accounted for 13.4 percent.4



America has maintained its industrial preeminence by transitioning away from high‐​volume, low‐​value industries into higher value‐​added production. In the process, the number of jobs in the manufacturing sector — perhaps the most important metric from a political standpoint — has declined. U.S. manufacturing employment reached its peak of 19.4 million jobs in 1979 — **fourteen years before the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreements and 22 years before China joined the World Trade Organization**. So the downward trend in manufacturing employment, along roughly the same trajectory for 30 years, began long before the common scapegoats for manufacturing job loss even existed.



Manufacturing job loss has very little to do with trade and a lot to do with changes in technology that lead to productivity gains and changes in consumer tastes. China has also experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs — in fact, many more jobs have been lost in China’s manufacturing sector — for the same reasons. According to a 2004 study published by the Conference Board, China lost 15 million manufacturing jobs between 1995 and 2002, a period during which 2 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost.5



The fact of the matter is that, with the exception of cyclical contractions during noted economic recessions, the U.S. manufacturing has been thriving in the global economy. Whether U.S. manufacturing will continue to thrive and even become a reliable job creator in the years ahead depends to some extent on the public policies adopted and eschewed.



 **No Longer “Us” vs. “Them”**



During the past few decades, a truly global division of labor has emerged, presenting opportunities for specialization, collaboration, and exchange on scales once unimaginable. The confluence of falling trade and investment barriers, revolutions in communications and transportation, the opening of China to the West, the collapse of communism, and the disintegration of Cold War political barriers has spawned a highly integrated global economy with vast potential to produce greater wealth and higher living standards.



The dramatic reduction in transportation and communication costs combined with widespread liberalization of trade, finance, and political barriers are all accomplices in what has been called “the death of distance.” Under the new paradigm, the factory floor is no longer contained within four walls and one roof. Instead, the factory floor spans the globe through a continuum of production and supply chains, allowing lead firms to optimize investment and output decisions by matching production, assembly, and other functions to the locations best suited for those activities. 



In the 21st century, it is inaccurate to characterize international trade as a competition between “us” and “them.” Because of foreign direct investment, joint ventures, and other equity‐​sharing arrangements, quite often “we” are “they” and “they” are “we.” Even the U.S. automobile and steel industries attest to this new reality. And as a result of the proliferation of disaggregated, transnational production and supply chains, “we” and “they” often collaborate in the same endeavor. Under the new paradigm, workers in developed and emerging countries are more likely to be coworkers than competitors. Today’s global economic competition is less likely to feature “our” producers against “their” producers and more likely to feature entities that defy national identification because they are truly international in their operations, creating products and services from value‐​added activities in multiple countries. There is competition between supply chains, but success first demands cooperation and collaboration within supply chains (i.e., cooperation and collaboration between some of “us” and some of “them”). This new commercial reality demands policies that are welcoming of imports and foreign investment, and that minimize regulations or administrative frictions that are based on misconceptions about some vague or ill‐​defined “national interest.”



A recent analysis from the Asian Development Bank Institute of the complex production‐​supply chain surrounding production of Apple’s iPhone is both testament to the benefits of globalization and the latest indictment of a decrepit international trade flow accounting system that nourishes misleading trade skeptics and misinforms policy.



Following in the footsteps of a groundbreaking and widely‐​cited 2007 University of California‐​Irvine study, which disaggregated the components of a Chinese‐​assembled Apple iPod and assigned its constituent value to the companies and countries responsible for their production, two researchers at the Asian Development Bank Institute applied a similar analysis to the Apple iPhone. Like the UC‐​Irvine iPod study before it, the ADBI analysis found that just a tiny fraction of the cost of producing the iPhone is Chinese value‐​added. The only Chinese input is labor, which is used to assemble the components manufactured in other countries. The value of that labor accounts for $6.50 or 3.6 percent of the total cost of $178.96 to produce an iPhone (about the same percentage as the iPod). The other 96.4 percent of that total is the cost of components produced (and the labor and overhead employed to produce those components) in Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United States, and several other countries. This breakdown is very similar to that found for the iPod in 2007, and the punch lines are identical.



While firms in Japan and Germany account for the most expensive parts (and quite obviously benefit from the advent of the iPhone), most of the value of the iPhone (like the iPod) accrues to Apple, which reaps the lion’s share of the approximately 100 percent markup. When iPhones sell for $399 in the United States, the difference between that retail price and the $178.96 cost of production goes to retailers, distributors, marketers, other firms in the supply chain, and to Apple, which distributes some earnings to its shareholders and retains some for research and development, supporting engineering and design jobs higher up the value chain so that the virtuous circle can continue.



Rather than appreciate how this complementary process harnesses the benefits of our globalized division of labor, some begrudge iPod and iPhone sales in the United States for adding to the bilateral trade deficit. Technically, for every $399 iPhone sold in the United States, the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China increases by $178.96 (its full cost of production). Even though only $6.50 of that iPhone is Chinese value, under our antiquated, pre‐​globalization, method of tallying a nation’s imports and exports, the entire $178.96 is chalked up as an import from China because that was the product’s final point of assembly. According to the authors of the ADBI study, iPhones added $1.9 billion to the politically volatile U.S. trade deficit with China in 2009. Alas, this is the basis of the claim — popular among the most shameless trade critics — that America has a “high‐​tech” trade deficit with China.



Should we lament a trade deficit in iPhones or any other products assembled abroad, particularly when those products comprise U.S. value‐​added and support high‐​paying U.S. jobs?



U.S. factories and workers are more likely to be collaborating with Chinese factories and workers in production of the same goods than they are to be competing directly. The proliferation of vertical integration (whereby the production process is carved up and each function performed where it is most efficient to perform that function) and transnational supply chains has joined higher value‐​added U.S. manufacturing, design, and R&D activities with lower‐​value manufacturing and assembly operations in China. Though the focus is typically on American workers who are displaced by competition from China, legions of American workers and their factories, offices, and laboratories would be idled without access to complementary Chinese workers in Chinese factories. Without access to lower‐​cost labor in places like Shenzhen, countless ideas hatched in U.S. laboratories — which became viable commercial products that support hundreds of thousands of jobs in engineering, design, marketing, logistics, retailing, finance, accounting, and manufacturing — might never have made it beyond conception because the costs of production would have been deemed prohibitive for mass consumption. Just imagine if all of the components in the Apple iPhone had to be manufactured and assembled in the United States. Instead of $178.96 per unit, the cost of production might be multiple times that amount, and quite possibly prohibitive.



Consider how many fewer iPhones Apple would have sold; how many fewer jobs iPhone production, distribution, and sales would have supported; how many fewer young programmers would be employed designing “apps”; how much lower Apple’s profits (and those of the entities in its supply chains) would have been; how much lower Apple’s research and development expenditures would have been; how much smaller the markets for music and video downloads, car accessories, jogging accessories, and docking stations would be; how many fewer jobs those industries would support; and the lower profits those industries would generate. Now multiply that process by the hundreds of other similarly ubiquitous devices and gadgets: computers, hand‐​held video game players, Blu‐​Ray devices, and every other product that is designed in the United States and assembled in China from components made in the United States and elsewhere.



It is beyond question that countless U.S. jobs depend on imports from China. _The Atlantic_ ’s James Fallows characterizes the complementarity of U.S. and Chinese production sharing as following the shape of a “Smiley Curve” plotted on a chart where the production process from start to finish is measured along the horizontal axis and the value of each stage of production is measured on the vertical axis. U.S. value‐​added comes at the early stages — in branding, product conception, engineering, and design. Chinese value‐​added operations occupy the middle stages — some engineering, some manufacturing and assembly, primarily. And more U.S. value‐​added occurs at the end stages in logistics, retailing, and after‐​market servicing. Under this typical production arrangement, collaboration, not competition, is what links U.S. and Chinese workers.



Over the past couple of centuries, economists have spoken of comparative advantage in the context of industries. In David Ricardo’s telling, Portugal had a comparative advantage in wine‐​making and England had a comparative advantage in cloth‐​making. So each country would focus its productive efforts where they were most efficient, and exchange surpluses, to attain the highest level of output and consumption. Today comparative advantage can apply to functions in the supply chain. China may have a comparative advantage in electronic assembly operations vis‐​á‐​vis the United States today, the United States may have a comparative advantage in product design vis‐​á‐​vis Japan, and Japan may have a comparative advantage in component production. Instead of trading wine for cloth, the modern set‐​up implies a collaboration between U.S. engineers, Japanese manufacturers, and Chinese assemblers — that is, collaboration in the production of Apple iPods and similar products. But as a country’s skill sets change — partly as a function of its policies — the people will become relatively more efficient in some endeavors and relatively less efficient in others.



That countries are not destined to remain in their current supply chain rungs, but can ascend or descend the value‐​chain, as the case may be, should be motivation enough for governments, both rich and poor, and at all stages of development, to adopt the policies that are most likely to provide the greatest and highest valued‐​added opportunities for their people.



 **Imports Get an Undeservedly Bad Rap**



People generally understand that exports contribute to economic growth, which is essential to job creation. But many then make the mistake of reasoning: if exports help grow the economy and create jobs, then imports must shrink the economy and cost jobs. That is the central misconception perpetrated by media every month when the Census Bureau releases the monthly trade figures. Emblematic of this kind of bad reporting is last week’s story by AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger, who wrote: “A widening trade deficit hurts the U.S. economy. When imports outpace exports, more jobs go to foreign workers than to U.S. workers.” Well, that outcome is possible, but as an ironclad law, it is an indefensible statement.



The description of global production and supply chains above is a fairly strong argument for the benefits of imports and strong evidence that imports support U.S. jobs. But imports support U.S. employment through many other channels, as well. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for more than 55 percent of the value of all U.S. imports last year. So, imports that are too often assumed to be consumer goods that come at the expense of domestic production are more often than not used as inputs for domestic production. Better and more affordable access to those imports helps reduce the costs of production, enabling producers to better compete and support U.S. jobs and wages. The 45 percent of imports that are consumer goods support U.S. jobs in logistics, transportation, wholesaling, retailing, and after‐​market service industries. The nearby charts show how imports move in tandem with GDP and employment.





And by helping to keep prices lower and quality higher, imports allow consumers to have more resources with which to purchase other products and services or to save, both of which support more U.S. jobs. The next set of charts compares price changes over time of products that tend to be heavily traded and products and services that are generally not traded.





Moreover, when U.S. consumers and producers purchase imports, foreigners obtain dollars with which they can support U.S. jobs through their own purchase of U.S. exports or through investment in U.S. businesses.



Some of the misunderstanding can be traced to the famous National Income Identity, which expresses gross domestic product, as: Y = C + G + I + (X-M). That is, national output (Y) equals personal consumption (C) plus government spending (G) plus investment (I) plus exports (X) minus imports (M).



The expression clearly lends itself to the wrong interpretation. The minus sign preceding imports suggests a negative relationship with output. It is the reason for the oft‐​repeated fallacy that imports are a drag on growth. But that is the wrong conclusion.



The expression is an accounting identity, which “accounts” for all of the possible channels for disposing of our national output. That output is either consumed in the private sector (C), consumed by government (G), invested by business (I), or exported (X). The identity requires subtraction of aggregate imports because consumption, government spending, business investment, and exports all contain, in various amounts, import value. Americans consume domestic and imported products and services, the aggregate of which shows up in consumption. Likewise, government purchases include domestic and imported products and services; businesses invest in domestic and imported machines and inventory; and, exports often contain some imported intermediate components. Thus, the identity would overstate national output if it didn’t make that adjustment for imports. After all, imports are not made on U.S. soil with U.S. factors of production, so they shouldn’t be included in an expression of our national output.



To reiterate, it is a simple matter of accounting: as an expression of national output, the National Income Identity subtracts imports only because imports are that portion of consumption, government spending, investment, and exports that are not produced on U.S. soil with U.S. factors of production. If we did not subtract an aggregate import value, then national output would be overstated.



But this is unnecessarily confusing. Why has it not been commonplace to use notation that conveys in no uncertain terms that C and G and I and X include some amount of imports? Maybe something like this: Y=C(d)+C(m)+G(d)+G(m)+I(d)+I(m)+X(d)+X(m)-M, where (d) connotes domestic; (m) connotes imported; and M=C(m)+G(m)+I(m)+X(m).



Again, imports are subtracted, not because they are a drag on output, but because imports are included in the other constituent elements of the identity. I’ve always found it misleading that the parentheses go around X-M — which isolates the expression “net exports,” but in the process can obscure the fact that imports are subtracted from the whole expression.



 **The National Export Initiative**



In his February 2010 State of the Union address President Obama announced a goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. That goal was soon enshrined as the “National Export Initiative,” which has since become the centerpiece of the administration’s trade policy agenda.



Some of the components of the NEI are eminently sensible as standalone policies. For example, efforts to clarify, simplify, and streamline U.S. export control procedures — should they succeed — are likely to reduce regulatory obstacles and spur meaningful export growth without imposing new burdens or diverting resources from elsewhere in the economy. Likewise, passage of the long‐​pending bilateral trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, and conclusion of the decade‐​long Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and the ongoing Trans‐​Pacific Partnership negotiations would reduce or eliminate barriers to U.S. exports in a variety of sectors. And, it would not be unreasonable to expect that the resulting increase in trade would lead to job growth — despite the anomaly of 2010 (i.e., positive economic growth, strong trade growth, but negative job growth).



But other aspects of the National Export Initiative — call them errors of omission and commission — are more troubling. The NEI presumes that the only obstacles confronting U.S. exporters are those that exclusively concern their activities as exporters. But, in fact, before they are exporters these companies are producers, and as producers they have production costs that are often inflated by dint of policy — import duties, a weak dollar, regulatory compliance costs. The NEI is silent on these significant obstacles to U.S. competitiveness at home and abroad.



According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for more than 55 percent of the value of all U.S. imports last year. That fact alone makes clear that imports are crucial determinants of the profitability of U.S. producers and their capacity to compete at home and abroad. Yet the NEI commits not a word to the task of eliminating or reducing the burdens of government policies that inflate import prices and production costs.



During the decade between 2000 and 2009, the United States imposed 164 antidumping measures on a variety of products from dozens of countries. A total of 131 of those 164 measures restricted (and in most cases, still restrict) imports of intermediate goods and raw materials used by downstream U.S. producers in the production of their final products. The cases were filed and the duties imposed without any of these downstream companies having had the opportunity to make their case before the International Trade Commission that the duties would adversely affect them. Under the present antidumping statute, the administering authorities are forbidden from considering the impact on consuming industries — or the impact on the economy more broadly — when deciding whether or not to levy the duties. That is a major oversight that should have been identified as an obstacle to U.S. export competitiveness by the administration in its development of the NEI.



In January, a _Wall Street Journal_ editorial featured the story of what was recently a profitable and expanding magnesium die‐​cast auto parts industry in the United States. The U.S. and foreign markets for these engine parts (which are lighter but stronger than the more common aluminum parts, so in high demand from auto producers looking to improve fuel efficiency) were growing. But then the sole U.S. producer of magnesium — a monopolist in Utah — brought an antidumping case against imports from China and Russia. The resulting duties drove the cost of magnesium in the United States well above the world price, and slowly but surely, the U.S. firms started to die off. That an industry comprised of a single producer with 370 employees can snuff out downstream industries — particularly up‐​and‐​coming industries — is costly economic policy that the NEI should be addressing.



Another concern about the NEI is that it may tempt the administration further down the slippery slope of industrial policy. Although doubling exports to $3.14 trillion by the end of 2014 would be a laudable achievement, enshrining that goal as a national imperative presents risks. “Five‐​Year Plans” have a way of breeding zealous devotion to goals for the sake of goals, sometimes at the expense of the process that would otherwise lay the foundation for greater and enduring success. By exhorting U.S. exporters to “win the future” and describing the imperative of “making sure we’re not ceding markets, exports, and the jobs they support to other nations,” the president is reinforcing an image of trade as an adversarial, zero‐​sum endeavor.



With over $100 billion in direct subsidies and tax credits already devoted to green technology, it is no secret that President Obama has been promoting investment in solar panel, wind harnessing, lithium ion battery, and other industries he deems crucial. Concerning those industries, the president said: “Countries like China are moving even faster… I’m not going to settle for a situation where the United States comes in second place or third place or fourth place in what will be the most important economic engine of the future.“6



With all due respect, how does the president know that those will be the most important economic engines of the future? By placing bets on particular industries, the administration is overriding a selective, evolutionary process that has undergirded the world’s most successful innovation machine, while reducing the chances of worthy ideas, firms, and industries leading the next commercial wave. Did President Obama’s predecessors anticipate the arrival of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or Marc Zuckerberg and the revolutionary products and services they delivered? Did Washington bureaucrats foresee the advent of specific life‐​extending medicines and devices, like digestible, pill‐​sized cameras? Had those proposing industrial policy in response to a rising Japan in the 1980s and early 1990s prevailed, much of the technology and medical advances taken for granted today never would have come to fruition. 



Despite the risks and uncertainty of industrial policy, the administration seems to be getting a lot of encouragement in that direction from a wide swath of captains of industry, economics writers, and media pundits.



 **Policy Solutions**



A serious plan to boost U.S. economic growth and hiring should start by identifying all policies, regulations, practices, and conditions that impede U.S. competitiveness, not just those obstacles that confront U.S. companies as exporters.



Although trade’s critics speak of a “race to the bottom,” where governments compete for investment by lowering their standards — a concern unsupported by trade and investment flows — it is really more appropriate to speak of a race to the top. Governments are competing for business investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions; and so on. Those once‐​clear American advantages have atrophied.7



This global competition in policy is a positive development, but we are kidding ourselves if we think that we don’t have to compete and earn our share with good policies. The decisions we make now with respect to policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the number and kinds of jobs created, as well as the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.



According to a survey of 13,000 business executives worldwide, conducted by the World Economic Forum, 52 countries have less burdensome regulations than the United States. Add to the fact that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate among all OECD countries, the sense that the rule of law is no longer bedrock, the business and political climates remain uncertain, asset expropriation (through torts, bankruptcy, antitrust and other mechanisms) is a real threat, the workforce doesn’t have the skills required by producers in an economy at the technological fore, the regulatory environment is stifling, compliance costs are eating into the bottom lines of more and more companies, the government treats our innovators as adversaries, physical infrastructure is in disrepair, and it becomes less mysterious why U.S. businesses aren’t investing and hiring in droves. Meanwhile, forward‐​looking governments around the world are wooing investment in R&D facilities, high‐​end manufacturing plants, and educated human beings with proper incentives, as U.S. policies treat those investors and skilled immigrants with contempt or indifference.



President Obama visited recently with the Chamber of Commerce and argued that he had made concessions to business by moving toward the center on tax and trade policy, and that now was the time for business to reciprocate by investing and hiring. But the president’s small steps toward the center come after two years of sprinting to the left on economic policy. After ObamaCare, Dodd‐​Frank, taxpayer bailouts, unorthodox and legally‐​questionable bankruptcy procedures, subsidies for select industries, Buy American and other regulations governing how and with whom “stimulus” dollars could be spent, and the administration’s tightening embrace of industrial policy, businesses want a more quiet, less intrusive, less antagonistic, predictable policy environment before they will feel comfortable investing and hiring. In the meantime, a policy that would likely produce quick dividends would be one that reduces the administrative costs of importing. After all, most U.S. exporters — before they are exporters — are producers. And as producers they consume raw materials and other industrial inputs and components. Many of those inputs are imported or their costs are affected by the availability and prices of imports.



The president understands this. On August 11, 2010 at a White House signing ceremony, he offered the following rationale for a bill he was about to sign into law:



The Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 will create jobs, help American companies compete, and strengthen manufacturing as a key driver of our economic recovery. And here’s how it works. To make their products, manufacturers — some of whom are represented here today — often have to import certain materials from other countries and pay tariffs on those materials. This legislation will reduce or eliminate some of those tariffs, which will significantly lower costs for American companies across the manufacturing landscape — from cars to chemicals; medical devices to sporting goods. And that will boost output, support good jobs here at home, and lower prices for American consumers.



It’s tough to argue with that rationale. After all, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” accounted for 55 percent of U.S. import value last year, which amounted to over $1 trillion in costs. U.S. tariffs and other import barriers increase the costs of production for U.S. companies, putting them at a disadvantage vis‐​á‐​vis foreign firms in the U.S. market and abroad.



But America’s competitors aren’t sitting still. Over the past two years, the Canadian and Mexican governments unilaterally slashed tariffs on a host of industrial inputs to reduce production cost and boost the competitiveness of their producers. Small and mid‐​sized businesses were reported to be enthusiastic about the tariff cuts, which will cut costs and paperwork. By 2015, the only goods subject to import duties in Canada will be supply‐​managed goods in the agricultural sector and some consumer products.



And in Mexico, in an effort to “reduce business operating costs, attract and retain foreign investment, raise business productivity, and provide consumers a greater variety and better quality of goods and services at competitive prices,” the Mexican government initiated a plan in 2007 to unilaterally reduce tariffs on 70 percent of the items on its tariff schedule. Those 8,000 items, comprising 20 different industrial sectors, accounted for about half of all Mexican import value in 2007. When the final phase of the plan is implemented on January 1, 2013, the average industrial tariff rate in Mexico will have fallen from 10.4 percent to 4.3 percent.



Among the major differences between the U.S. tariff liberalization and those in Canada and Mexico is that the U.S. action is temporary and only applicable to industrial inputs if there is no producer interest that objects. Our bolder North American neighbors have instituted permanent liberalization across the spectrum so as to afford their producers lower costs and an operational environment of greater business certainty.



On tariffs and other reforms that could encourage business investment and hiring, U.S. policymakers have a lot to learn from the actions of our trade partners.

"**Memes, often in the form of humorous images and videos, are a major part of how people communicate on the internet, but they can also be used to spread disinformation.**
We've been looking at how these memes can present false and misleading information about Covid-19 vaccines, feeding into concerns about their efficacy or safety.
A popular meme - including images from rapper Drake's Hotline Bling music video - popped up in a number of local and community online forums in the UK and US this week - spreading false claims that a vaccine will modify our genetic code (DNA).
It also says the recovery rate from the disease is 99.97% - suggesting getting the disease is a safer option than a vaccine.
We've seen similar arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media - asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.
To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus - is not correct.
About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, Senior Statistician at the University of Oxford.
So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.
However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"" .
Without a vaccine, there will be many more infections - and therefore deaths - before enough people are immune to stop the spread. This is known as herd immunity - when a certain portion of the population have caught the virus.
It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.
This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.
Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says.
""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".
While mainly associated with humour, memes can also carry negative messages on emotive subjects.
Some of the most common memes about vaccines make it appear that a vaccine can have some radical side effects.
Images of disfigured people or creatures are shared alongside claims that they show the ""first person to receive the vaccine"" or captions saying that the jab ""didn't even hurt"".
It might seem obvious these images are not meant to be taken literally, but they are often shared in groups which are strongly opposed to vaccinations.
It's true that vaccines can have side effects, but these are mostly mild such as a sore arm, headache or a raised temperature for a day or two.
Vaccines go through rigorous safety checks before they can be administered to the public, with side effects closely monitored.
When memes have been appearing on social media feeds for months, some people start questioning if there's anything to these false or baseless claims.
""Memes like these can be disarming, because they tap into fears we all have about trust in science and medication side effects"" says Joan Donovan, a lecturer at Harvard University, and an expert on disinformation.
""Tying together negative messaging to pop culture can be especially memorable and drive people to share because the meme is funny, outrageous, or sticky (memorable).""
Another widely shared group of memes links falsehoods about vaccines to freedom and individual liberties.
One we've seen uses images of someone applying clown make-up, suggesting requirements for wearing a mask will be followed by an ""experimental vaccine"" and then an ""implantable microchip"".
Other posts seek to downplay the risks of coronavirus and suggest there is an ulterior motive behind the development of a vaccine.
Vaccines must meet a high standard of safety and effectiveness before they are approved for use - it's misleading to call them experimental.
As for the microchip rumour, we've debunked that before.
Another example suggests vaccines will lead to demands for people to surrender their firearms, and the confinement of people in ""virus relocation centres"". There is no evidence whatsoever to support these claims.
A recent report looking at the online conversation about vaccines in English, French and Spanish, found that the theme of liberty and freedom was more common in English, and particularly in the US.
Seb Cubbon, one of the co-authors of the report from anti-misinformation non-profit organisation First Draft, told the BBC this could be down to a number of factors, including America's political history and the relationship that citizens perceive they have with the state.
""As always, we should genuinely respect and appreciate people's views and opinions, such as the one that vaccines undermine personal freedoms"" he said.
""But the case can also be made that vaccines actually increase people's freedom to do things they otherwise wouldn't be able to, and can also contribute to safeguarding other people's personal freedoms too.""

"Westminster has failed to control rising electricity and gas prices. Between 1997 and 2013, UK households saw combined electricity and gas prices rise by 54% in real terms. In contrast, family income has fallen in real terms by approximately 7% over this period.  Little wonder  families are under financial pressure. And according to the charity Age UK, 20% of pensioners are being forced to reduce their energy bills by cutting back on heating their homes. The future could be even bleaker, with families and pensioners facing the very real possibility of blackouts in the next year or two. Both the industry regulator Ofgem and the Scottish government in its recent paper “UK energy policy and Scotland’s contribution to security of supply” have pointed to the looming danger of widespread power shortages across the UK. Ofgem in a report to be published later this month is very likely to highlight that spare electricity capacity has declined even further.   So why have Westminster and the power sector allowed this crisis to arise? The coalition government’s flagship initiative, electricity market reform (EMR), has failed lamentably to help protect electricity supplies. Ageing power stations are not being replaced fast enough and there has been a hiatus in energy infrastructure investment. The UK government’s rubbishing of the case for Scottish independence at every available opportunity seems to have contributed to a climate of market uncertainty, not least from its recent paper “Scotland analysis: energy”. Recent decisions by leading UK and international utility companies to restructure their portfolios and cancel projects illustrates clearly the lack of market confidence.  The UK government’s more general coolness towards renewables is measured by the now well established Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index. Its most recent edition last month said, “the prospect of solar market reforms has sparked another period of uncertainty for developers and investors in the UK, pushing it down to sixth place [in the renewables rankings] below Canada.”  Westminster’s intention to curb solar power subsidies and to possibly abandon future UK onshore wind subsidies completely has heightened the risk of power shortages. If more developers and investors withdraw, it also risks increasing electricity prices in the face of supply shortages.   The irony is that both solar and onshore wind have established themselves as mature, clean and relatively cost-effective power options. Unlike the adverse public perception of fracking and nuclear power, opinion polls, including those produced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), consistently show very high levels of public support for renewables. The upshot of these problem policies is that the UK will need large amounts of renewable electricity both to keep the lights on and to meet the 2020 green energy targets. One option would be to build more capacity in England and Wales, but as mentioned before, this is not on the coalition’s agenda. Assuming this doesn’t change, and it would take a long time if it did, the UK will have to get it from elsewhere. The situation is different in Scotland, where the large amounts of wind power capacity already mean that it has an electricity generating surplus of some 25%.  Within the union, this means that Scotland is preventing a bad situation from being worse. In 2012 Scotland exported 10,717GWh to England for example, plus another 2,179GWh to Northern Ireland. England also relied heavily on imports from its European interconnectors, which supplied 12,197 GWh that year. As National Grid said in its March report, “Getting more connected: the opportunity from greater electricity interconnection” that, “with the current programme of power station closures ongoing, and demand potentially picking up as economic growth returns, the need for imports is set to continue.”   The UK government has long threatened that in the event of a yes vote, it would source its electricity from France, the Netherlands and Ireland instead of Scotland, to the extent it was cheaper. Not only is it already relying on these European interconnectors for about 5% of its power, the argument goes that it will get more in future through plans to build new links over the next few years.  In reality, expanding this network further is fraught with difficulties. These include cost, planning, technical challenges and complex legal agreements. As Ofgem said last year, “Great Britain is not the only European country expecting de-rated margins to fall in the next six winters. France, Ireland, Germany and Belgium are also facing security of supply challenges.” So security of supply constraints are also becoming very prevalent in the markets that supply power via interconnectors. This will reduce what they can sell over the English Channel.   In all likelihood, a rump UK would have no choice but to buy Scotland’s electricity generating surplus of around 25%. The UK government is significantly underplaying the important role that Scotland’s electricity plays in keeping the lights on across the UK.  And while the English may baulk at effectively subsidising Scotland’s green power sector, there is the consolation that purchasing this spare power will actually make very good commercial sense for Westminster. Compared to both English offshore wind and new nuclear build, Scottish onshore wind is much cheaper. Carrying out the threat in the energy paper would be as clear a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face as one can imagine.  The coalition’s other panacea to the looming energy crisis has been to hail the birth of the next generation of new nuclear build –- but that doesn’t even begin to address the issue of imminent power shortages. Even one new nuclear plant is likely to be 10 years away.   A new generation of nuclear stations also requires hundreds of billions of pounds of financial investment – the experience with Hinkley Point C is that the government would potentially end up underwriting large proportions of these costs to bring its vision to life. Meanwhile the waste and decommissioning costs will raise electricity bills for households and business even higher. Already 42% of DECC’s annual budget is spent on the UK’s nuclear legacy. In short, to avoid blackouts and further electricity price increases, Westminster now needs to stop the political posturing and take preventative action by raising its commitment to renewables and accepting the importance of Scotland in the equation regardless of whether it chooses to vote for independence. Are we going to see this any time soon? Don’t bet on it. On this vital matter of national energy security, the government appears totally out of touch. "

"**A pub close to the border between tier two and three coronavirus restrictions must stay shut after lockdown.**
The Wharf Inn, in Welford, is in tier three Leicestershire but is just a matter of yards from Northamptonshire, which is in tier two.
Landlady Anna Raven said it was ""frustrating"" that she would only be able to serve takeaways instead of reopening from 2 December.
Harborough District Council said it had 'no choice' but to follow the rules.
The pub falls within Leicestershire County Council's area but has a Northamptonshire postcode.
The sign welcoming people to the Harborough District is directly on the other side of the road.
Being classed as tier two would have allowed The Wharf Inn to serve alcohol as part of a substantial meal until 23:00 GMT.
Ms Raven said she felt the new restrictions had been ""rushed through"" and did not take into account geographical subtleties.
""I don't think it's anything malicious. It's literally down to the speed of the red tape,"" she said.
""It's come in and they've had to apply it but they haven't considered these little foibles that exist around the country that can make a huge difference.
""To the government, it's not really a consideration at this time because they have so much else to deal with.
""But someone could have taken a little time to say, 'this is viable, we can let this happen and let them open their doors'.
""I'm not angry, just a little frustrated we couldn't resume service and claw back up the ladder to something relatively normal.""
A Harborough District Council spokesman said: ""Whilst we understand the frustrations of some businesses impacted by the restrictions, the council has no choice but to follow the current government restrictions which have been introduced.
""However we understand the government will be publishing its regulations next week which may provide further clarification regarding boundaries.""

"The discovery of a nearly complete fossil skeleton of a teenage girl in the Hoyo Negro submerged cave system in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula provides new insight into the first people to inhabit the Americas at the end of the last ice age. Our knowledge of the appearance of the earliest Americans, called Paleoindians by anthropologists, their background and inherited traits is based on no more than 30 individual skeletons found in the entire North American continent. Most of these include only fragments of the entire skeleton, and only twelve have been directly dated. So the addition of any newly discovered Paleoindian skeleton constitutes a major find – the fact that this skeleton is nearly intact makes it very rare. Unfortunately, the preservation of collagen was extremely poor in these waterlogged bones, so indirect dating techniques had to be used. The authors, led by Jim Chatters, argue the skeleton’s age must be constrained by the timing of the sink hole’s inundation as sea levels rose. Using the uranium-thorium radiometric dating method on the calcite florets – mineral deposits – that accumulated on the exposed bones of the skeleton before the chamber filled with sea water, the skeleton is placed at a minimum age of around 12,000 years (+/- 200 years).  Radiocarbon ages on the skull’s tooth enamel suggest a calibrated age of 12,900-12,700 years, making her one of the oldest human finds in the Americas. So it appears that this teenage girl, which the dive team named Naia, fell into the sinkhole and died sometime between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago, just at the end of the last glacial period. What is interesting about Naia’s body, small at only 4ft 10ins and surrounded by the bones of sabre-tooth tigers, pumas, and other animals that shared her fate in the sinkhole over the centuries, is the ancient mitochondrial DNA extracted from a molar tooth. Mitochondrial DNA is genetic material that is inherited solely from the mother, and so can be used to trace hereditary genetic relationships. After genetic sequencing, the authors placed her DNA within the D1 subgroup of “haplogroup D”. A haplogroup is a section or group of sections of mitochondrial DNA collectively inherited from the mother. The D haplogroup is thought to have originated in Asia some 48,000 years ago, and is one of five found among Native American peoples, the others being A, B, C, and X. But this particular subgroup D1 occurs only in the Americas, and the discovery of this skeleton adds weight to what is known as the Beringia Standstill hypothesis. This holds that the original ancestral Native Americans were isolated genetically from other populations for thousands of years. The proponents of the hypothesis, Erika Tamm and colleagues, estimate that Asian and American mitichondrial DNA haplogroups diverged more than 25,000 years ago, but that the latter dispersed in the New World less than 15,000 years ago. The age of the skeleton from Hoyo Negro falls well within this chronology. Another intriguing aspect of Naia’s skeleton concerns her facial features and teeth. She like other Paleoindians, and unlike most contemporary Native Americans, had smaller, narrower skulls and sharply projected faces. This also supports the idea that all Paleoindians derive from the same source populations in Asia, via Beringia.  The late and noted anthropologist Christy Turner said of this theory in 1999 that the facial features and teeth of Paleoindian skulls he’d examined led him to believe that these people had an appearance unlike either their Asian ancestors, or their Native American descendants. In Turner’s view, these people “looked more like each other than they did anybody else”. This unusual facial appearance, unlike contemporary Native Americans or northeast Asians, has perplexed paleoanthropologists for decades, leading some people to suggest that the Paleoindians were perhaps descended from a European ancestor, or possibly the ancestors of the modern Ainu people of Japan. This is because some of the facial features seen on Paleoindian skulls are more similar to Caucasian features. These aspects of Paleoindian facial features were clearly preserved in Kennewick Man, a 7,000-year-old Paleoindian skeleton from Washington state discovered by Jim Chatters in 1996.  Instead, the differences between the cranio-facial features of modern Native Americans and Paleoindians are due to evolutionary changes that have come since the divergence of Beringians from their Asian ancestors, brought to America in subsequent waves of immigration.  Naia’s remains are key to explaining the Paleoindians’ unique facial appearance, and how they can be, despite their differences, both descendants of ancient Asian peoples, and the ancestors of most Native North American groups of today."
"City-dwellers consider cycling or walking to work to be part of a healthy routine. But latest studies on air pollution show that nanoparticles – unseen pollutants – are a major concern.  In the UK, the number of cyclists is increasing. It has been dubbed the  “Wiggo effect”, following the success of British cyclist Bradley Wiggins at the 2012 Olympics. But to make sure the Wiggo effect provides the health benefits cycling promises, better urban planning is needed to protect cyclists from polluted air. New research from our group, published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, shows that a simple solution to the problem could be building green roadside corridors of vegetation. Air pollution takes different forms. Nanoparticles, those smaller than 100 nanometre (billionth of a metre) in diameter, are of great concern from a health perspective. Their small size allows them to enter deep into the respiratory system and reach other parts of the body.  Road vehicles are a major source of nanoparticles. While humans can tolerate exposure to nanoparticles to a certain limit, cyclists and pedestrians risk exposure beyond that limit. A report from the Health Effects Institute suggested these particles could be inhaled more deeply into the lung and might be more toxic than larger particles. This is simply because these particles remain suspended in the air longer and they are able to penetrate and deposit in the respiratory systems. What makes matters worse is that harmful organic compounds, which would have otherwise passed through the system, stick to these particles because of their large surface area per unit volume. The number of deaths caused by nanoparticles exposure is hard to estimate, but a recent review study published an estimate of Asian cities. These estimates suggest that in 2010 in Delhi about 1900 deaths per million were caused by traffic-related nanoparticle exposure alone. Similar or worse air pollution conditions can be expected in all the ten other Asian megacities in 2010 and assuming similar mortality rates in Asian megacities to those in Delhi, rough estimates suggest 310,000 deaths per year. Whether the level of exposure to nanoparticle pollution is harmful depends broadly on two factors: air pollution concentration, and the level of physical activity of the person breathing. The more physical exertion, the more air we take in. Cycling is an intensive activity where breathing rates can be more than 30% higher than during walking. If we take the example of a 42km road race using the typical concentrations of nanoparticles obtained from our study, the exposure doses of nanoparticles experienced by cyclists for covering this distance could be 65% higher compared with walkers who cover the same distance with the benefit of a green corridor. Trees help in cleaning our environment by acting as a sink for air pollution and producing fresh oxygen for us. What has been less clear until now is whether it matters where this urban vegetation is planted. When trees are planted along roadsides where there are densely packed buildings around them, they can actually trap pollutants by restricting their removal. Instead, when trees and vegetation are planted along the roadsides in non-built environments, such as along open busy roadsides or highways, they are effective at restricting pollutants from reaching footpaths.  Our research supports this finding, and demonstrates the effectiveness of roadside vegetation barriers to reduce nanoparticle pollution by at least one-third. If these green barriers are placed alongside the busy open roads, these can restrict freshly-emitted air pollution, including nanoparticles, and stop them reaching footpath users, cutting down exposure to appreciable levels. Most cities worldwide are facing the issue of air pollution with high nanoparticle exposure, a common phenomenon. Cutting emission exposure by more than a third just by utilising already available resources is an intelligent way to make a big difference. That is the least we can do to ensure cycling brings the promised health benefits."

"**Mass testing plans in England threaten to be a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine, health leaders have warned.**
The PM has said mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends.
But experts have questioned whether this is possible due to the ""enormous"" resources it requires.
The government said it will work with local authorities to support plans.
In a joint statement, the Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said improving NHS Test and Trace must remain the top focus for testing.
Mass testing of people without symptoms using new rapid ""lateral flow"" tests - which give a result in about 20 minutes, without the need for a lab - has been piloted in Liverpool.
So far more than 100,000 people without symptoms have been tested using the new rapid tests, with just over 700 positive results.
Now thousands of rapid tests have been sent to more than 90 local authorities in England as part of an expansion of the Liverpool scheme, which was supported by 2,000 members of the military.
One of those is Liverpool's neighbour, the borough of Sefton, which has half as many residents.
But the area says it only has a team of 12 people to carry out mass testing and has been offered no other support.
The Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said: ""The additional capacity provided to Liverpool to set up and manage testing sites alone has been enormous and it is difficult to envisage how or even whether this could be replicated at the pace being proposed across the country.
""This threatens to be a distraction from other activities, like planning and rolling out vaccines.""
Their statement added: ""The key priority needs to be targeted community testing... in settings or locations of higher risk of transmission or where the consequence of infection is higher.""
The government is asking local leaders and directors of public health in tier three to put forward proposals and said it will work with them to make sure they're resourced.
It said it is not expecting to see Liverpool replicated up and down the country.
Liverpool's mass testing pilot began earlier this month. Prof Louise Kenny, pro vice chancellor at Liverpool University, which is running the pilot scheme with the city council, said they were delighted with the results.
""It was a pilot, we had very few expectations about how it would turn out. But I'm really pleased by how the city has embraced it from all corners,"" she said.
""Yes, it's been lower in some areas but we're addressing that by making the testing more available, we assess what the barriers are, that's a work in progress.
""And I think the fact that we have identified over 700 of our residents who were positive, didn't know it, were at risk to their fellow citizens is a hugely encouraging thing."""

Not a day goes by without the publication of an **illogical rant** by some unhinged politician of the Left. These poor deluded creatures, deceived by their own beliefs, are only succeeding in making themselves the laughing stock of normal thinking people. 



Unfortunately, much of what they have to say is no laughing matter. On subjects such as economics, religion or society they spout a narrative that is born out of ignorance, hate, racism, and ideology. They harbour the fanciful thought process whereby **hate speech is enunciated by everyone but themselves,** when in fact the opposite is true.



The problem these people on the Left have is that most of their hateful rhetoric is ideologically driven. **Beliefs held based on ideology rely on basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis.** Think Marama Davidson, Golriz Ghahraman and Julie Anne Genter for starters! These lunatics don’t pay any attention to reality or facts, they are just hell-bent on spouting their dogma which is anathema to rational people. They are so blinded to their philosophies that all logical thought becomes non-existent.



This modus operandi in the sense we are talking, if left unchecked can have dangerous elements. Some examples:



 **Economically** it’s all about the policies of redistribution, screwing the so-called rich pricks, many of whom in reality aren’t, with no thought that eventually, you will run out of other people’s money.



 **Climate Change** is where the fear element is introduced. Scare the living daylights out of impressionable young people with a load of unproven nonsense that we’ll all be dead in twelve years. Brainwash them to the point where they take it upon themselves to play truant for a cause on which they haven’t been given a balanced viewpoint. Julie Anne then informs us that this is our World War 2 moment. You have to be seriously ignorant and plain potty to come up with that comparison.



 **Religion** is where these demented marketers of hate are at their venomous best. Golriz would have us believe that Jesus was a Palestinian refugee, an idea it appears, she got from two of her left-wing sisters in America namely Ilhan Omar and Linda Sarsour. The fact that this is **patently not true** is of no concern to these ideologically driven personages. Obviously, the nonsensical point here is to have us believe that the Jews are not a race of people and that Judaism is simply a religion. The Left is anti-Semitic the world over while denying that they speak the language of hate.



 **Freedom of Speech** including hate speech is fine, providing you follow the rules of the Left which ironically are all about hate, anger and ridiculous assertions which have no truth in reality.



Perhaps the one thing that takes the cake is the madwoman Ocasio-Cortez, who managed to insult virtually the whole world by claiming camps on America’s southern border were akin to Nazi concentration camps. A statement that is breathtaking in its ignorance and stupidity. Was a bartender, now more of a barbarian it seems.



The Left today is nothing more than demented, deluded and deranged jackasses with **a dangerous agenda based on numerous falsehoods.** They are aided and abetted by equally dangerous organisations such as the United Nations and the European Union.



As Margaret Thatcher said – Left-wing zealots have often been prepared to ride roughshod over due process and basic considerations of fairness when they think they can get away with it. For them, the end always seems to justify the means. That is precisely how their predecessors came to create the gulag.



Begone! Enough is enough!

"**Rapid Covid tests will be introduced in an area previously dropped from the mass testing programme.**
Redcar Council has received 10,000 lateral flow tests, which are able to produce results in under half an hour.
A pilot to offer tests to Redcar's 36,000 residents did not go ahead and now the authority is in talks over the cost of reintroducing it.
Councillor Steve Kay said the 10,000 rapid tests would help protect the ""most vulnerable"".
All councils in the Tees Valley have been offered the opportunity for residents to take part in mass testing.
But some councillors were concerned about who would pay for it, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Redcar and Cleveland Council leader Mary Lanigan said an initial proposal for local authorities to staff testing stations with their own volunteers was ""unacceptable"".
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen asked whether there would be support from the Army or other resources.
""Following a conversation with council leaders they agreed they want me to go back to Matt Hancock and say we want the mass testing, but we do need the resources and the finances to run it,"" he said.
The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.
Mr Houchen also raised concerns about whether people would agree to be tested with the risk of having to self-isolate over Christmas.
Talks are expected to continue next week.
Two testing sites at the Inspire 2 Learn Car Park on Normanby Road, South Bank and the Kirkleatham Walled Garden in Redcar will be joined by a third due to open in Guisborough in December.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnthony Watts this week posted twice on Michael Mann’s seemingly indignant (over)reaction to people criticizing his work here and here.

Dr. Michael Mann feels industry and skeptic scientists are out to get him, and that the world’s climate is on the verge of catastrophe. Source: climatedepot.com/
From the shrillness and combativeness of his tones, one might get the impression that he may have never gotten past the emotional level of potty training. Sadly the behavior of some of his climate scientists is equally discouraging. For example, alarmist scientists have recently reached new levels of creativity when it comes to making up stories to explain away the growing body of observations contradicting the claims of runaway warming. Many of these scientists avoid good climate news like Superman avoids Kryptonite. One has to ask if this unrelenting insistence and obsession with imminent global climate catastrophe is a normal state of mind.
As news, data, and observations pour in from all over the world suggesting that the scenarios of global warming catastrophe are totally wrong, is it normal to greet such findings with hostility of the kind we’ve been seeing? And is it a healthy state of mind that has one altering the recorded temperature measurements from the past until they produce the curve that agrees with catastrophe scenarios, as James Hansen has been doing?
Is it psychologically normal to attribute record cold and snow to a cooling that is caused by global warming?
So with all this going on, should our suspicions about Michael Mann’s state of mind be laid to rest when he constantly claims being the “target of a witch hunt”, of having “received a number of anonymous death threats“, or being the target of “a destructive public-relations campaign being waged by fossil fuel companies, front groups, and individuals aligned with them“? Michael Mann seems to have developed an incredible blindness to real causes. Forget his ego, which has him thinking the world is out to get him.
There’s a reason, Dr. Mann, why your integrity has been forcefully attacked and damaged. It stems in part from your misleading, sloppy, hockey stick science, but foremost from your own pig-headed refusal to fess up. People normally just don’t react amicably when others attempt to force a false reality upon them.

Contrary to what you believe, your “hockey stick” is in no way that “icon in the climate-change debate, providing potent, graphic evidence of human-caused climate change.” Rather it has become in the climate science community the icon of shoddy, misleading and disingenuous science. This has been clearly demonstrated by McKitrick and McInytre, von Storch, Soon, and others, and then confirmed by the National Academy of Sciences AND by the leaked climate e-mails in which your own colleagues ridiculed it.
Your refusal to accept this harsh reality is the very source of your soiled public integrity, and it’s only going to get much worse until you do come to terms with it. It really is time for you to close this sorrowful chapter, one which you yourself have authored.
Your harshest critics are not being driven by the fossil fuels industry. It’s your own obstinate behavior that is fueling the hurricane-force criticism that you are now finding too tough to face. Your obsession with the fantasy of fossil fuels destroying the the planet is mostly irrational and appears to some as borderline paranoia.
“My plight is dramatic.”
Indeed it is. And we really do hope you’ll get the help you need – and soon.

"When Hurricane Sandy struck New York in 2012, it was a brutal wake up call for the Big Apple.  That call should have also been heard by the citizens of every other coastal city and those responsible for ensuring their safety – though there is little evidence that it has.  Sandy was the largest ever recorded Atlantic hurricane and, after Katrina, the second most costly, causing damage of around US$70 billion in the US alone. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds of thousands made homeless along the storm’s path through the Caribbean, US, and Canada. But while 24 US states were affected, it was the inundation of Lower Manhattan that generated the largest shock waves.  The death, destruction and general havoc wreaked by Sandy laid bare the inadequacies of current approaches to coastal flood risk management, generating a storm of public outrage. Hurricane Katrina’s devastation of New Orleans in 2005 had been bad enough, but images of one of the world’s most iconic coastal cities being inundated by a storm surge despite several days advance warning were truly shocking. If it could happen to New York City, isn’t every other coastal community also at risk of catastrophic flooding? The scientific answer to that question is, of course, an emphatic yes.  The Rebuild by Design competition held to promote radical new approaches to protecting the city has now identified six winning projects, and it’s apparent that all are substantially based on using green and blue infrastructure to provide more natural and flexible defence than concrete walls. These defences work by mimicking the natural functions of coastal wetlands, woodlands, barrier beaches and offshore reefs in sapping the energy of waves and storm surges to reduce their height and rob them of destructive strength. Between storms, they provide a wide range of habitats necessary to support diverse ecosystems, providing leisure and commercial opportunities, including lost natural resources such as fisheries and oyster beds. The lesson from Sandy is that while there are good reasons why huge population centres have developed adjacent to and just a few feet above the ocean, living there involves flood risk – a risk that cannot be eliminated, but can, and must, be reduced to a level that is acceptable, or at least tolerable.  This applies not only to coastal cities in the US, but to every coastal conurbation and, especially, to Asian mega-cities. Easily said, but how can this be done?  It won’t be through business as usual, or even incremental changes to conventional flood risk management approaches. Following the European floods of the late 1990s and early 2000s, the UK government’s Flood Foresight paper reinforced the message that hard choices have to be made. It’s such a pity that, with subsequent severe flooding in Britain and elsewhere, from Australia to Zimbabwe, it seems the lesson has to be learned repeatedly and the hard way. The need for radical new thinking did not go unrecognised in New Orleans. But the understandable, though scientifically and socially flawed, decision to simply rebuild breached defences and devastated neighbourhoods prevailed. Proposals to re-locate communities away from highest risk areas and return the most vulnerable land to its previous role of providing natural flood protection were ignored. Even the Green NOLA design competition in 2006, which set out to deliver “visionary yet practical responses” to the city’s problems, lacked the backing it needed from the authorities. But the Rebuild by Design competition is different to that in New Orleans. It has the backing of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which gives the winning designs a real chance of being built. The designers seem to have engaged directly with communities and business owners at risk to find solutions that are not only radical, but which reflect the preferences of the people who will live and work around them every day.    It is an uncomfortable truth that the level of flood defence that can be provided to a community is limited by the value of the assets at risk. The solution has to make sense economically, which is why London is protected against a one-in-a-thousand-year flood, while Hemsby on the Norfolk coast is economically undefendable. In Lower Manhattan, not just densely packed public housing, iconic buildings, and infrastructure such as the subway and electricity sub-stations are at risk, but Wall Street itself. This explains why there’s substantial funding available to provide protection against another Sandy-sized surge. The winning concept for Lower Manhattan, a green design that includes parkland and a banked earth flood wall around the tip of the island named the “Big U”, is costed at US$335m – a considerable sum but easily justified when compared to what’s at risk.  The aim of using blue-green infrastructure in place of the old fashioned grey kind is to recreate a naturally-oriented water cycle that contributes to the amenity of the city by bringing together water and environmental management. This is achieved by combining and protecting the hydrological and ecological values of the urban landscape while providing resilient and adaptive measures to deal with flood and drought events. In this spirit, the Big U creates publicly accessible green spaces that will deliver social, economic and environmental benefits even when the defences are not keeping out storm surges, which is of course most of the time. The project’s other great advantage is that it’s adaptable. Not only will it provide protection now, it also allows for a planned retreat from the coastline should that be necessary in future. This could be the case if, for example, melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet drives a larger than expected rise in sea level: unlikely, but not impossible.  But what about neighbourhoods not home to a global financial hub? Neighbouring communities on Staten Island and in Hoboken, New Jersey, are typical of dozens of ordinary towns and cities along the east coast affected by Sandy. While in sight of Manhattan, they are in different leagues, economically.  They too were considered in Rebuild by Design, leading to five winning projects for other areas around the coasts of New York City and New Jersey, and running the total cost up to around US$1 billion. According to Rebuild by Design, Staten Island merits US$60m of investment in Living Breakwaters and artificial reefs that provide sustainable coastal defence while restoring the valuable shoreline and marine ecosystems previously sacrificed to conventional concrete sea walls.  On the other hand Hoboken is envisaged as a Resiliency District where, by reducing the vulnerability of homes, businesses and infrastructure to flooding that cannot be prevented economically, it is hoped public-private finance will step in to support badly needed urban renewal. The initial cost of US$230m is affordable, but is just the start, and building a resilient community will require concerted, long-term investment by government and local businesses, which makes the future for Hoboken rather less secure than that of Lower Manhattan, or even Staten Island.  The Rebuild by Design competition has produced worthy winners that address current flood risks effectively and affordably, while leaving space for adaptation to an uncertain future, recreating lost habitats and providing public green spaces of considerable socio-economic value. The winning solutions are sustainable in that they use science responsibly to conceive radical solutions that offer economic security while greening the urban landscape and restoring shoreline environments.   But the jury is still out on whether even these radical new approaches can deliver these benefits in ways that are socially equitable. In practice, this will depend more on good governance than creative engineering, something outside the scope of any design team. Achieving social justice in flood risk management relies on the willingness of people not just to get involved but to stay involved long after the damage of the trigger event has been repaired and the trauma, though dreadful, has passed.  If Rebuilding by Design can lay the foundations for long-term community engagement in managing flood risk in New York and New Jersey it will fully deserve all the plaudits it looks likely to receive."

There has been a flurry of articles and op‐​eds over the past few weeks about how President Donald Trump has supposedly engineered a dramatic departure from the liberal world order that the United States has led for roughly seventy years.



An _Associated Press_ story explained, “on a broad range of foreign policy matters, Trump has steadfastly refused to adopt conventional approaches, straining decades‐​long alliances, refusing to condemn authoritarian regimes on human rights abuses and escalating the rhetoric in a nuclear stand‐​off with North Korea.”



In a _Washington Post_ op‐​ed that focused mostly on Trump’s autocratic tendencies at home, Joe Scarborough also lamented Trump’s praise “of autocrats across the world as they were ruthlessly consolidating power in countries such as Russia, China and the Philippines.”



The _New York Times_ ’ Mark Landler offered up one of the more thoroughgoing assessments, contending that:



 _Mr. Trump has transformed the world’s view of the United States from a reliable anchor of the liberal, rules‐​based international order into something more inward‐​looking and unpredictable. That is a seminal change from the role the country has played for 70 years, under presidents from both parties, and it has lasting implications for how other countries chart their futures._



On closer inspection, these assessments seem overwrought. President Trump has not abandoned U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. On the contrary, he allowed Montenegro’s admission to NATO to go forward, the first new member in ten years. Last month, he backed the sale of weapons to Ukraine’s government as it struggles to put down a Russia‐​backed insurgency. He increased the number of U.S. troops in Europe. None of these decisions advance U.S. security—arguably, they undermine it—so it is hardly consistent with what most Americans think of when they hear “America First.” What’s more, these actions provide little evidence that Donald Trump is overly solicitous of Vladimir Putin, or particularly mindful of Russia’s geopolitical insecurities.



In Asia, most Americans have focused on the deepening crisis over North Korea’s nuclear program and Donald Trump’s war of words with Kim Jong‐​un. In practice, however, Trump has not significantly departed from the status quo that he inherited. The U.S. Navy continues to operate extensively throughout the Asia‐​Pacific. There are still tens of thousands of troops in Korea and Japan, and the Trump administration has shown no signs of reducing that permanent presence, despite the president’s stated misgivings, and the dubious connection between such a presence and U.S. safety.





Trump’s Twitter rants and ill‐​considered off‐​hand comments have not made us, or the world, safer.



Meanwhile, across the Greater Middle East, Trump has expanded the air war against ISIS, Al Qaeda, violent extremists, or anyone, really, who might possibly pose a threat. The fact that many hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of innocent civilians have been killed in this campaign reflects a degree of callousness and indifference to human suffering, and is consistent with Trump’s rhetoric during his campaign. Barack Obama, and George W. Bush before him, justified occasional “collateral damage” in the service of the Global War on Terror as an unfortunate side‐​effect of the necessary use of force.



Lastly, on the question of whether Trump has broken sharply with the foreign policy elite or affirmed that elite’s preferences, let’s not forget, Trump expanded the U.S. ground presence in Afghanistan, despite the fact that he had repeatedly questioned the wisdom of continuing the war. In the end, both Landler and AP reporters Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller admit that Trump didn’t depart from the national security establishment’s collective wisdom that the war—already seventeen years old—should continue indefinitely.



In short, Trump’s rhetoric suggests that he is willing to abandon primacy—America’s de facto foreign policy for the past several decades—but his actions largely affirm the status quo, which makes him indistinguishable from his predecessors in a number of critical respects.



If you are skeptical, ask yourself: would Hillary Clinton have withdrawn troops from Afghanistan, wound down the drone war, or blocked NATO expansion or the Ukrainian arms sale?



I doubt it. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.



To be sure, Donald Trump _has_ pushed through a number of changes to U.S. foreign policy that neither Obama nor Clinton would have (e.g. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord; reversal on better relations with Cuba; threats to undo the Iran nuclear deal; calls for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital). Indeed, if there is a single theme connecting his disparate actions it seems to be “If Obama did it, it must be wrong.” But, on matters of substance, and particularly with respect to the U.S. global military posture, Donald Trump hasn’t changed that much.



So, why all the fuss? Because Trump _is_ different. Words matter, and Trump’s Twitter rants and ill‐​considered off‐​hand comments have not made us, or the world, safer.



Unsurprisingly, U.S. allies in Europe and Asia have questioned, and at times openly defied, Washington’s dictates. “We’re beginning to see countries take matters into their own hands,” observes Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “They’re hedging against America’s unreliability.”



We might ask, “What took so long?” The U.S. liberal global order was never as liberal as advertised (consider Washington’s support for illiberal dictators and perilous partners during the Cold War and since). It was mostly focused on a few favored allies, and excluded those we didn’t like (so, not exactly global). And it wasn’t even that orderly (the disastrous Iraq War, after all, resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, millions of refugees and destabilized an entire region). The rules, meanwhile, applied to others, not to us. It was unrealistic to think that it could last indefinitely, especially when the American people are desperate for something different.



We should be disappointed, therefore, that concerns about Trump and Trumpism haven’t prompted a more serious debate over the future of U.S. foreign policy. Instead we get lamentations that all is lost, followed by a forlorn hope to go back to the way it was before.

_\---_   
  
A new paper has been published in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ that examines trends in heavy rainfall amounts across the U.S. The paper is authored by Newcastle University’s Renaud Barbero and colleagues, and, to summarize, finds that the heaviest rainfall events of the year have been increasing in magnitude since 1951 when averaged across nearly 500 stations distributed across the U.S. (note: results from individual stations may differ from the general finding).   
  
Someone with a critical eye might ask the _real_ question, which is “how much?” That such a number does not jump out of this paper—a cynic would say—probably means it is very small. Read on and you will find the answer.   
  
That rainfall on the rainiest day of the year is increasing is, of itself, hardly surprising considering that the total annual rainfall amount averaged across the U.S. has also been increasing during this same period (again, results from individual locations/regions may (and do) depart from this generality).   
  
Changes in heavy rainfall like this are often luridly described as a “disproportionate increase” in extreme events, or that extreme precipitation increases are “worse than expected.”   




This is not the case—or at least wasn’t the case when we published a paper in the _International Journal of Climatology_ on this very subject back in 2004. In that paper we found the same thing that Barbero and colleagues found with regards to the heaviest daily rainfall events of each year—they were getting heavier. But, we were careful to note, that so too was the total yearly rainfall, and as a result, the increase of the heaviest daily rainfall events was _completely proportional to the increase in annual rainfall increase_. In other words, the increase on the wettest day each year was neither “disproportionate” nor “worse than expected.”   
  
In fact, this result was not a surprise at all. It’s basic climatology.   
  
Let’s have a look, and while we’re at it, we’ll update our old analysis (which ended with data from 2001) with data available from a new “extremes” dataset which runs through 2010.   
  
The “extremes” data set we’ll use is the one compiled by Markus Donat and colleagues and includes gridded data (3.75° longitude x 2.5° latitude grid) on annual daily rainfall extremes as well as data on annual total rainfall. This data is available using this handy on-line tool. We selected the region of interest as shown in Figure 1.   






_Figure 1. Study area used in this analysis._



Now, let’s look at the relationship between total annual rainfall and daily maximum rainfall for each year, averaged across the gridcells contained in our study area, as shown in Figure 2. Years with more total rain also have more rainfall on the wettest day of the year. This is no different during the first half of the 20th century (1901-1950; blue points) than it has been in the time since (1951-2010; red points). Any human-caused climate change (which should be more evident in the latter period) hasn’t led to a change in this general climatological relationship.   






_Figure 2. The average of the annual total precipitation (across the grids in the boxed area in Figure 1) plotted against the average of the annual daily maximum precipitation for two different time periods._



Let’s dig in a bit further. In Figure 3a (top) we plot the amount of precipitation falling during the wettest day of the year averaged across our study area. The data run from 1901-2010 and show a small, but statistically significant increase. Figure 3b (middle) shows the average total annual precipitation over the same period. Again, a slight and significant increase. And finally, Figure 3c (bottom) shows that the proportion of annual precipitation delivered during the wettest day of the year (Figure 3a divided by Figure 3b) exhibits no overall trend. In other words, the relationship between total rain and heavy rain remains unchanged. Each of these precipitation histories shows a good bit of temporal variation. If human-caused climate change is playing a role here, it is neither readily discernible nor resulting in unusual behavior.   






_Figure 3. (a, top) The daily precipitation on the wettest day of the year averaged across the region depicted in Figure 1, 1901-2010; (b, middle) The total annual precipitation averaged across the region depicted in Figure 1, 1901-2010; (c, bottom) the proportion of total annual precipitation delivered during the wettest day of the year, 1901-2010._



From Figure 3a we can also see the actual increase in the amount of rainfall falling on the rainiest day of the year. It’s just a tad more than one-tenth of an inch. We submit that that isn’t “extreme,” “disproportionate” or even “consequential.” It’s just a very small number. To emphasize to the point of ridiculousness, hold your thumb and index finger a tenth of an inch apart and imagine the horrific damage that this increase in rain must cause!   
  
In fact, if global warming has a hand in increasing annual precipitation totals, this would seem as a good thing (positive externality) considering the anticipated increase in water-use demand. According to a recent report from the Pacific Institute on our nation’s water-use trends:   




We conclude that considerable progress has been made in managing the nation’s water — but the current pace is not likely to counter the demands of continued population and economic growth, climate change, and increasing tensions over scarce water resources. National water use remains high, and many freshwater systems are under stress from overuse. While there is reason to believe this may be changing, we must continue efforts to improve water-use efficiency in our homes, businesses, and on our nation’s farms.



All of this confirms that our original finding from 2004 continues to remain valid and thus our conclusions from that paper are worth repeating:   




Our results support the contention that, where changes are significant, there is an increase in the amount of rain occurring on heavy rain days. However, our results provide no support for the argument that the increase in total annual rainfall observed across the USA is disproportionately occurring on the wettest days — a contention that may have arisen from methodological constraints rather than true changes in the nature of precipitation delivery…   
  
Our results argue strongly that the increase in rainfall in the coterminous 48 states that has been observed in the last 100 years has not resulted in any systematic disproportion in the percentage of that increase allocated to the heaviest rain days.



But then, as is the case now, the actual amount of the increase is so small as to be operationally meaningless, even if it were caused by emissions of dreaded carbon dioxide (a hypothesis that is rather difficult to prove). The same holds true for the large majority of other impacts from anthropogenic climate change—despite what you may read in the other media outlets.

"The European policies designed to encourage a more biodiverse environment that is better able to support wildlife and plants are failing. In fact, our analysis of the reforms designed to “green” the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) suggests they neither encourage greater wildlife abundance nor provide adequate protection for vulnerable habitats such as grasslands.  Finally adopted in March, the long process of reforming the CAP was supposed to require farmers to “observe practices beneficial to the climate and environment” in order to qualify for some of their direct payment subsidies, as well as offering pro-environmental farm stewardship as a voluntary step. While we depend upon the food grown in agricultural fields we also benefit from the environment to which they are a part, from the wildlife such as the iconic skylarks lauded by Vaughan Williams, or the “green and pleasant land” of a traditional, diverse rural landscape. Land given over to agriculture should produce more than just food and profits, but things of a wider worth to society.  The reformed CAP is an effort to recognise that we should pay farmers to produce both. Much of Northwest Europe’s farmland is now monotonous, monocrop farmland, degraded and denuded of its wildlife. Eastern Europe’s more traditional landscapes remain wildlife rich, and the policies’ green measures should help protect them, while encouraging farm modernisation. This is the aim but not, we discovered, the reality. In the UK, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA)’s code on environmental claims says words such as “greener” can be justified if the advertised product provides a total environmental benefit over that of the marketer’s previous product, and the basis of the comparison is clear. Let’s apply this logic to the CAP reform. As part of a team of environmental and farming experts from across the EU, we analysed the “greening” credentials of the new CAP relative to the old one. Our results, published in the journal Science, reveal that, alarmingly, the reformed CAP fails the ASA test: there is no basis for claiming that it is greener. While many farmers across Europe have in the past volunteered to receive payments for the so-called “agri-environment schemes”, some of which have provided environmental benefits, this budget has shrunk by almost 20%. For the reformed CAP to increase its environmental benefit overall, any benefits lost as a result would have to first be replaced.  The reformed CAP introduces three measures: Ecological Focus Areas, in which 5% of agricultural land is managed to provide habitat for wildlife. Maintaining 95% of permanent grasslands, home to many wildflowers and the insects and birds they support, from being ploughed into fields. And the requirement to grow at least three crops on arable farms over 30 hectares in order to generate a more diverse landscape. Ecological Focus Areas will only work if they provide the right habitat for wildlife in the right place. But the scheme doesn’t include those interventions known to help wildlife, such as flowers planted for pollinators, or plots for ground-nesting birds.  And in any case, the payment rests on simply having them, rather than managing them in the right way or in the right place to make a difference. Management is critical to making any real difference – hedgerows, for example, are not much good for birds and insects if they are cut short every year and hardly allowed to flower. Fallow land is poor for wildlife if it is sprayed with herbicide in late spring to prevent weeds colonising crops. The measure designed to protect permanent grassland, doesn’t. A farmer can continue to collect the subsidy if they convert a patch of flower-rich meadow into an intensively-managed improved pasture field, because it is technically still “grassland”. If taken up, the 5% reduction allowable under the scheme will over the six-year lifespan of the current CAP represent more than double the rate of loss of permanent grassland that occurred between 1993 and 2011, when just over 6% of Europe’s grasslands were lost. As for the three crop rule, there is no evidence that having three crops, rather than two or one, provides any environmental or diversity benefit. It entirely depends on which crops are planted, and how they are managed – for example, what pesticides are used and when. Even now in half of EU member states the average arable farm already has four or five crops, so requiring three will not provide any additional environmental benefits. On top of it all, most European farmers and about half the farmed area are in any case exempt from Ecological Focus Areas and minimum crop diversity, because they don’t apply to livestock farms or small arable farms. The message that, after hard-won reform, the CAP is now greener is really appealing to society, so it’s particularly unfortunate that our analysis indicates that it is nothing of the sort. It’s important that national governments recognise that our evidence-based analysis indicates a shortfall between rhetoric and reality, and do what they can in their own power to improve matters.   It is also up to us, as citizens and consumers, to recognise that relying on food to be cheap and plentiful implies that sustainable farming will take second place.  If we don’t like this choice, it’s up to us to voice it."
"**A Kent MP ""initially surprised and disappointed"" by the move to place the county into tier three has said the strain on hospitals makes it necessary.**
Laura Trott, the Conservative MP for Sevenoaks, said there was ""simply no leeway"" in hospital capacity.
She said the number of patients being admitted with Covid-19 continued to increase on a daily basis, with elective operations being cancelled.
Meanwhile, other MPs have expressed dissatisfaction with the tier system.
Kent MPs who had been hoping for separate tiers for varying boroughs are due to meet Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Monday.
Ashford MP Damian Green said that, unless he sees ""convincing evidence"", he will vote against the new tier system next week, describing it as ""irrational"".
Ms Trott, who sits on the Health and Social Care Committee, said she had spent Thursday speaking to local hospitals and health ministers, after which the need for the heightened restrictions had become clear.
She said Darent Valley Hospital, near Dartford, was full, but ""trying to add additional beds"", and the Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Pembury, was at 90% capacity.
She revealed that the NHS in Medway and Swale was deploying full ""'business continuity measures', which basically means they have declared a major incident and can no longer accept new cases"".
She said in Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells five of the 20 operating theatres had closed so staff could be redeployed to wards.
""There is simply no leeway in our hospital capacity, and it is vital that we use every tool possible to prevent a further rise in cases from their already high base locally,"" she said.
""The government has pledged to review our status in two weeks. If there is a reduction in pressure on our hospitals, I will push very hard for us to return to a district level tier system in Kent.""

 _Global Science Report is a weekly feature from the Center for the Study of Science, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s Benjamin Santer and his mentor, Tom Wigley, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research seem, well, a little _obsessed_ over Cato’s Pat Michaels. First, Santer threatened to “beat the cr&p out of him”, and then Wigley tried to foment a cabal to “re-assess” his doctoral dissertation, under grounds that were completely, unalterably, and demonstrably 100 percent false.   
  
So it’s no surprise that they have just published—two years after the fact—what they consider to be a rejoinder to Michaels’ 2010 testimony to the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Science and Technology of the United States House of Representatives. There’s about as much real substance here as there was in Wigley’s very ill-informed (and seemingly actionable, if Michaels didn’t have a day job here at Cato) campaign against his doctorate.   
  
It’s just been published in the journal _Climate Dynamics_. This is technically peer-reviewed, but, judging from the climategate emails and the serial paper trail of threatening journal editors (say, by writing to the University administrations where they worked) as well as the less than high quality contents of the actual paper, it makes you wonder just how critical the reviewers actually were.   
  
In their paper, Wigley and Santer wrote:   




Michaels’ 2010 Congressional testimony...is in conflict with the results presented here. This testimony makes the claims that “…greenhouse-related warming is clearly below the mean of relevant forecasts by IPCC”, and that “… the Finding of Endangerment from greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency is based on a very dubious and critical assumption”. The “assumption” referred to here is the IPCC statement that is the primary focus of the present paper, i.e., the statement that most of the warming since 1950 is very likely due to the human-caused increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.



Regarding Michaels’ statement that “…greenhouse-related warming is clearly below the mean of relevant forecasts by IPCC” Wigley and Santer argued that:   




Roughly half of these [IPCC climate model] simulations did not consider the cooling effect of indirect aerosol forcing, so the results, on average, would be biased towards trends that are warmer than observed even if the models were perfect (cf. Santer et al. 2011).



So the climate models are biased to producing more warming than is observed? Isn’t that what Michaels said? These guys just won’t take “yes” for an answer.   




And in fact, the reference in the above quote to “Santer et al. 2011” is a paper published by Santer and Wigley (and 15 others) that finds:   




The multi-model average [lower atmospheric temperature] trend is always larger than the average observed [lower atmospheric temperature] trend…[a]s the trend fitting period increases…average observed trends are increasingly more unusual with respect to the multi-model distribution of forced trends.



That says what you think it says! Model temperature trends are _always_ higher than the observed temperature trends and that over longer periods (i.e., more robust analysis) the model/observed discrepancy grows. Here is the relevant figure from that paper.   






**Figure 1.** A comparison between modeled and observed trends in the average temperature of the lower atmosphere, for periods ranging from 10 to 32 years (during the period 1979 through 2010). The yellow is the 5-95 percentile range of individual model projections, the green is the model average, the red and blue are the average of the observations, as compiled by Remote Sensing Systems and University of Alabama in Huntsville respectively (adapted from Santer et al., 2011).   
  
Their own analysis supports Michaels’ contention, which they somehow say is wrong. Beats me.   
  
In fact, their picture looks an awful lot like the one that Michaels used in his testimony (Figure 2).   
  




**Figure 2.** Range of climate model probabilities of surface temperature trends (gray shading) overlaid with the observed surface temperature trend from the Climate Research Unit (blue line) (data through September 2010).   
  
It’s worth noting that Michaels’ was the first presenter of this type of chart several years ago. In fact, Wigley reviewed a paper it was in, helped get the editor to kill it, and then, with Santer, published something mighty similar. How strange for someone they are arguing is wrong.   
  
It goes on.   
  
They then take exception with Michaels’ statement to Congress that the IPCC’s central finding that “[m]ost of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations” is “dubious.”   
  
Wigley and Santer spill a lot of ink over the concept that _in the absence of everything else_ , that the _potential_ warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is likely greater than the _observed_ warming. Michaels didn’t say that it wasn’t. In fact, most people believe this as true.   
  
Michaels was concerned about the _observed_ warming not some hypothetical, unrealizable (and therefore unverifiable) change. After all, it is the actual warming that the environment largely responds to. So when assessing the accuracy of the IPCC statement on observed warming, it is therefore appropriate to divide it up between various elements as he did.   
  
While there’s a lot of gory detail in this discussion (see here, for more ), one thing that I think we all should be able to agree on is that it is physically impossible for something (like the emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases) to be responsible for causing _more_ than 100% of what has been observed, and that such statements like this one from Wigley and Santer’s paper,   




Here, the probability that the model-estimated GHG component of warming is greater than the entire observed trend (i.e., not just greater than ‘‘most’’ of the observed warming) is about 93%.



is something other than science, because one surely cannot find something that nature will not reveal.   
  
The bottom line here is that in their paper, Wigley and Santer seem to place more import on the attack of Pat Michaels, than they do on the actual logic behind it.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
It was hot here a couple of days ago. I walked past a huge aloe vera plant, taller than my head, that grows by our house. The heat radiating off of the plant was palpable. I could feel a wash of warm air over me as I stood downwind of it. For a while I thought about the curious ability of plants to heat the air around them, and then I let it go.
Figure 1. Solar absorber, natural style. Note how the design efficiently intercepts sunlight because of the spiral, uneven pattern of the leaves. Also note that the design keeps photons from escaping through the funnel-shaped nature of the leaf pattern. Finally, consider that when the plant emits IR from the inner leaves, it will be re-absorbed by outer leaves, perhaps a number of times. This gives the plant, in effect, a local “greenhouse effect” due to the multiple re-absorption of the IR. The leaf geometry also greatly slows down the passage of the air through the plant, once again increasing the local warming. The net of all of those is a warm plant, surrounded by warm air.
I was reminded of our aloe vera again when a friend sent me a copy of the paper “A Warm Miocene Climate at Low Atmospheric CO2 levels,” by Knorr et al. It reports the results of a climate model analysis of the Miocene, the period from about twenty-three million years ago up to five million years ago. It is in press at GRL (paywalled), but the results are discussed here.
In their abstract, we find (emphasis mine):
In this study we present climate simulations of the Late Miocene (11-7 Ma) with a preindustrial CO2 level, using a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). The simulated global mean surface temperature of ~17.8 ºC represents a significantly warmer climate than today. We have analyzed the relative importance of tectonic [shape and location of the continents] and  vegetation changes as forcing factors. We find that the strongest temperature increase is due to the Late Miocene vegetation distribution, which is more than three times stronger than the impact induced by tectonic alterations. Furthermore, a combination of both forcing factors results in a global temperature increase which is lower than the sum of the individual forcing effects. Energy balance estimates suggest that a reduction in the planetary albedo and a positive water vapor feedback in a warmer atmosphere are the dominating mechanisms to explain the temperature increase. Each of these factors contributes about one half to the global temperature rise of ~3 K. Our results suggest that a much warmer climate during the Late Miocene can be reconciled with CO2 concentrations similar to pre-industrial values.
In looking at the effect of plants on the climate, I’d like to discuss the use of the models, how much weight we should put on their results, and how they could be improved.

The first rule of models says
All Models Are Wrong, But Some Models Are Useful
Their usefulness, of course, depends on their ability to replicate the reality which they are modeling. One issue with the models is that many of them still are not what I call “lifelike”. I discussed this problem of “lifelike” climate model results here. If the models do not act like the real climate, why should we believe them? Unfortunately, no one has ever instituted this kind of test to compare all of the models. It should be a part of a standard suite of climate model tests … dream on.
So at the moment we don’t know if the climate model used in this test gives a lifelike simulation of today, much less of ten million years ago. But I digress. The study says (emphasis mine):
We utilize the comprehensive AOGCM ECHAM5-MPIOM without any flux corrections [e.g. Jungclaus et al., 2006]. The atmosphere model ECHAM5 was used at T31 resolution (~3.75º) with 19 vertical levels. The ocean model MPIOM was run at an average resolution of ~3º with 40 vertical layers. Vegetation is a fixed factor represented by specifying different land surface parameters like albedo, roughness length, vegetation ratio, leaf area index and maximum soil water capacity.
Here we run into another modeling problem. They have set up the vegetation parameters to coincide with what we know of the Miocene landscape. This, of course, means that they are using vegetation as a forcing, rather than a feedback.
But we have been informed, over and over, that the vegetation is a feedback and never a forcing …
This is both a strength and a weakness of the models. We can make assumptions like where the vegetation grew and force things in the model to be a certain way. Then we can see what the effect of that on the results might be.
Unfortunately, the climate doesn’t work that way, where one thing holds steady while everything else changes. So even though we can get some insights, we have no assurance that the effect that we find is real. For example, we don’t know if the Miocene vegetation (which is specified) fits with what the model says were the climate patterns of that time.
Setting aside the manifold questions about the model, there were a couple of interesting parts of the study. The first was that they find that the main effect of the plants occurred through a change in the albedo, particularly for the Sahara. This is in accord with my experience of the aloe vera plant, where it was absorbing much more energy than the ground around it. In part this was because of the albedo of the plant being lower than the ground beneath, but in part it was from the geometry of the plant. (This latter effect is neglected in the model.)
The second interesting thing involves these two statements of theirs about the albedo:
The planetary albedo in MIO [the Miocene simulation] is reduced by ~0.014, which causes less shortwave reflection by the atmosphere and a warming.
and
Based on a zero-dimensional energy balance model [e.g. Budyko, 1969] the impact of α [albedo] and ε [effective long wave emissivity] can be quantified, each causing about one half of the global warming of ~3 K.
Assuming the same solar intensity as the present (345 W/m2), which the authors say that they have done, this change in albedo would result in a change in solar radiation of 0.014 times 345 = 4.83 W/m2. Given the temperature change of 1.5°C from the albedo change, this gives a climate sensitivity of:
1.5°C * 3.7 W m-2 per doubling_CO2 / 4.83 W m-2 = 1.15°C per doubling of CO2.
Me, I think that climate sensitivity is an illusion based on a misunderstanding of how climate works … but for those who believe in it, using Knorr et al’s figures and their concepts, that gives a very low sensitivity, well below the IPCC canonical figure. The IPCC AR4 Summary for Policymakers says (emphasis mine):
The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a measure of the climate system response to sustained radiative forcing. It is not a projection but is defined as the global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. It is likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5°C with a best estimate of about 3°C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5°C.
“Very Unlikely”, in IPCC jargon, means less than 10% chance that the sensitivity is less than their minimum estimate of 1.5°C per doubling of CO2. Despite that, this study shows a sensitivity of about three-quarters of the IPCC minimum estimate …
So you’d think that the media headline from this study would be
“Climate Model Finds Extremely Low Climate Sensitivity”
Sadly, that might happen, but only in an alternate universe …
Best to all,
w.

"The city of Famagusta in Cyprus lies empty, as it has since the 1974 invasion that divided the island into north and south. The city its former inhabitants left behind is now a ghost town, streets overgrown with bushes, windowless buildings like concrete skulls, roofless brick homes left open to the elements.  Reviving Famagusta is a key part of the jigsaw puzzle that comprises the efforts to find a solution to Cyprus’ social and ethnic tensions, a puzzle that this year’s US-brokered talks between Turkish and Cyprus authorities hope to solve. While the events by which Famagusta came to be deserted, and the length of time it has remained so, are an extreme example, such abandoned brownfield land is all too common. The term brownfield, depending on your definition, refers to sites and broader areas that have been affected by their former land uses, have become derelict or underused, may have contamination issues, usually occupy space in developed urban areas and in any event require intervention to bring them back into beneficial use.  Brownfield redevelopment was among the issues Chancellor George Osborne raised at his annual Mansion House address, focusing on the urgent need to speed up the process of putting unused land to good use, specifically for housing. The Chancellor announced local authorities will be required to use Local Development Orders to pre-approve 90% of their brownfield sites for housing so that building can start sooner.  A sum of £5m is being allocated in support of this endeavour.  The chancellor’s announcement means a clear understanding of what exactly a brownfield is has returned to the heart of national politics. For example in the US brownfields are by definition contaminated. In England, the government’s regeneration vehicle – the Homes and Communities Agency – uses the term as a synonym for previously developed land, although it would be more useful to restrict the term to only previously developed land that is also vacant. While the exact definition does not always matter, when funding and government policies are targeted towards sites that meet specific criteria (as in the US) or allocated to government departments in order to meet targets (as was the case under the previous UK government) then definitions are vital. Mark Twain is credited with advising “buy land – they’re not making it any more”, and by and large he was right; he might have said “reuse brownfield land – they’ll make plenty more of it”. Some cities are shrinking (Detroit, most spectacularly), but most cities are growing, and can do so only by building up, down, or outward. In any case citizens expect, and authorities should strive for, progress. We expect a variety of services from city land: shelter, education, entertainment, manufacturing, offices, worship, shopping, sport and culture.  The structures housing these services may well outlast the service, but the land will outlast them all. We do not consume land in the way that we do food or fuel. But we do have a habit of discarding land and moving on to the next parcel to be used for the next land use.   We know reusing land is worthwhile. In the UK there’s little choice, being as it is a small, densely populated island with a long history of urban settlement. While our understanding of the long-term behaviour of cities as complex systems is getting better, we face the challenge of predicting the impact of different land uses, and choosing the most sustainable, or at least avoiding the obviously unsustainable. In many cases flexibility beyond the next land use is key. But for housing we are building a legacy that will last a century, perhaps more. Where we build our new homes will influence how far we travel to work, how well we interact with our neighbours, how creative we are likely to be. Think of brownfield sites as the empty space in the eight pieces on a grid with nine spaces where the challenge is to arrange them so as to form a coherent image. In just the same way as many economists argue full employment is undesirable, so the same goes for eradicating brownfield sites. A derelict site is needed to build the new hospital while the current one continues treating patients. Only once the new facility opens its operating theatre doors, can the old be demolished, in turn to become the site for a new school, perhaps, and so the land use cycle goes on turning. If an area has no immediate hard use for a site, then it can be put to interim uses: a garden, temporary car park, or an arena for outdoor performances and markets.  For most people the term brownfield site conjures up images of derelict factories, abandoned train stations, or closed mines. Yet by using the term to mean any previously developed land, past target-driven governments have claimed high rates of brownfield redevelopment. This nonsense extended to counting back gardens and housing estate open space as brownfields, resulting in the absurd accounting of infill development as brownfield reuse. This was eventually dropped by the coalition government, and the targets abandoned altogether. However best use of brownfield, in the colloquial sense, sites, and the challenge of wise stewardship of our cities, remains. The question we ought to be asking is what sort of cities are we trying to create, and then considering how those empty spaces in the puzzle can help us achieve that, in addition to building high, digging deep, and even occasionally spreading out. We need to minimise our reliance on the car and encourage the design of more walkable cities – ones that the high streets imagined by Mary Portas would benefit from, and which could begin to arrest the slide into obesity and diabetes it seems we are on. The challenge for the chancellor is to realise the Mansion has many rooms and not all can be counted. It is not only building houses on brownfield sites he should be supporting, but instead great urban places to live, work and play. He and his cabinet colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government should be encouraging us to create. He could keep perhaps in his pocket a child’s puzzle, to remind him that space is fixed but what we do with it is not."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe record cold that is still gripping Germany even set a record low at the warming-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research this weekend. At yahoo news.com.html today they write (my emphasis):
Last weekend the lowest temperatures in more than 100 years were recorded in many parts of the country for this time of the year. For example in Dresden the record of 1917 was broken, in Potsdam the record set in 1899 was broken. In northeastern Germany Sunday morning temperatures between -15°C and -20°C were widespread. […] ‘What we are now experiencing is a 100-year cold for the month of March,’ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal www.wetter.net.”
Germany has just seen its 5th consecutive colder-than-normal winter in a row (a record). Now Europeans are wondering if they’ll even see spring in April this year, let alone January.
It is a good time to ask ourselves just what were some of Germany’s leading “climate scientists” projecting in “peer-reviewed papers” using their super-computers and “sophisticated, fine tuned climate models” just a couple of years ago. Where were the world’s leading scientists saying we were headed just a few years ago?
To answer that, we remind readers of one spectacularly false projection made by scientists and media just 2 and half years ago, a time when they insisted we believe “the science is settled” and anyone who dared to doubt was just a “flat-earther…a denier”.
On September 30, 2010, German conservative flagship daily Die Welt here carried the visionary headline:
“By 2030 spring will begin already at the end of January
Scientists in Gießen have been simulating climate change in a time lapse in an experiment: Their findings are worrisome.”

In DIE WELT’s report, they wrote about how scientists of the Plant Ecology Institute at the University of Giessen were claiming that soil did not absorb CO2 as expected, and would emit even more of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide into the atmosphere than previously expected, thus accelerating global warming. These were the worrisome results of plant studies they had just conducted.
Institute Director Christoph Müller agreed that climate change was a natural process, but that the rate at how fast it was progressing was “unusual“.
DIE WELT added:
In 100 years the global temperature has risen an average of 0.7°C. What took thousands of years is now happening in 200 years. “Entire vegetation zones are going to shift. […] So that things do not get even hotter, something has to change”, demands Müller.
Miller then suggested a radical change in our lifestyle and on how we use energy.
I wonder in which direction Müller’s plant zones are shifting today? We do know that lots of migratory birds have turned back around and headed back south again.

Science is not a popularity contest. Scientific truth is not determined by a popular vote or by the fame of those who make an assertion. A ‘consensus’ is when people have conceded agreement about something most of them don’t actually fully believe.



So in that respect, it’s no more important that Apollo astronauts dispute the ‘consensus’ view of climate change than the bogus claim of ’97 percent of scientists’. But in other important respects, it’s a very telling statistic.



There are only 12 men who have walked on the moon, and only 4 are still living. Selected from the best of the best at the time, with impeccable reputations, why would any of them speak out and risk being called names like deniers of “basic physics”. Yet three of the four have: Harrison Schmitt, Charles Duke, Buzz Aldrin. (Plus others like Australian born Phil Chapman (support crew, Apollo 14) and Walter Cunningham (Apollo 7).



Climate alarmists love to invoke the name of NASA to try and justify their absurd catastrophism. “NASA put a man on the Moon”, runs the argument. “Why wouldn’t you believe **them**?”



It’d be merely churlish to point out that NASA also blew up two space shuttles. More pertinent is the fact that the climate tub-thumping unit, GISS, is only a very small part of the NASA bureaucracy. Assigning them the same gravitas as the Apollo program is as ridiculous as taking seriously the moon-hoax conspiracies of “a former NASA worker” who turns out to have been a low-level services contractor.



Or, perhaps, treating the ‘Very Special’ Nobel Peace Prize with the same respect as the Nobel Prize in Physics.



Maybe because they hate watching as the good name of NASA gets subverted into a pagan weather changing cult?



…The NASA space program was once one of mankind’s greatest scientific and engineering achievements. In 2012 49 former NASA staff including astronauts, directors of shuttle programs, flight operations, and spacecraft maintenance, wrote to NASA warning that GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) was risking NASA’s reputation by making unproven remarks and ignoring empirical evidence.



More importantly, one of the astronauts is a respected scientist, as opposed to an activist with a Communications degree. Guess which opinion the legacy media will rely on?



Harrison [Schmitt] has been a vocal skeptic now for at least nine years. So far the ABC has not asked him why, or anything at all on the topic. But then, he’s only a PhD in Geology, what would he know? If he had a degree in international relations and journalism, or law, he could tell us what the climate is going to do all the time.



“…I’m a geologist [says Schmitt]. I know the Earth is not nearly as fragile as we tend to think it is. It has gone through climate change, it is going through climate change at the present time. The only question is, is there any evidence that human beings are causing that change?…



As Michael Crichton points out in his ‘cli-fi’ thriller, _State of Fear_ , climate scientists routinely pass off reconstructions and models as ‘evidence’. Extremely provisional theories are passed off as ‘settled science’.



Right now, in my profession, there is no evidence. There are models. But models of very, very complex natural systems are often wrong. The observations that we make as geologists, and observational climatologists, do not show any evidence that human beings are causing this. Now, there is a whole bunch of unknowns…So that’s the only skepticism I have: What is the cause of climate change?



“Normally, we have always assumed up until the Industrial Revolution that climate change is a function of the solar cycles — and indeed, there is still very strong evidence that’s the case.”



Crichton also argues that the current funding model of science has turned it into just another state bureaucracy, slavish as any other to the policy demands of government. Schmitt agrees.



“I, as a scientist, expect to have people question orthodoxy. And we always used to do that. Now, unfortunately, funding by governments, particularly the United States government, is biasing science toward what the government wants to hear.



“That’s a very dangerous thing that’s happening in science today, and it’s not just in climate.”



  
There is no reason to heed Schmitt’s opinion as an Apollo astronaut more than anyone else’s. But there is every reason to pay attention to the uncomfortable questions he raises about the current state of science and how it is being distorted by politics and money.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel’s latest online piece here is dubbed “Conspiracy Theories: What Motivates The Fact-Deniers“. Hat-tip: Ulrich Elkmann.
Ironically, in what was designed to be a sharp attack on “climate change deniers”, turns out to be an unwitting confirmation by Spiegel that it has profoundly changed its position on the climate issue. And, although Spiegel may not be aware of it, its article even de facto endorses the position of climate “deniers”, i.e. that climate changes [naturally] and that man [only] has “an influence” on climate.
Well, what the hell probably doesn’t?

Online Spiegel now says man only has “an influence on the climate change process”.
By now a Spiegel editor reading this might think: “What is NoTricksZone writing here!” Allow me to explain.
In its latest online attack article, Spiegel cites an old, already discredited Lewandowsky paper from July 2012, with the aim of taking cheap shots at American right-wingers. But note how Spiegel starts its article, in yellow above, (my emphasis):
The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing and that the man-made CO2 emissions have an influence on this process.”
Man has an influence? Really? That’s it – just “an influence”? Why didn’t Spiegel write something like “man-made CO2 emissions have a serious and unprecedented impact on this process” – like they always used to do? The following depicts what Spiegel used to think what “man’s influence” on climate was:

Spiegel front-page cover of Aug 11, 1986, issue no. 33/1986. depicts what Spiegel used to think of climate change.
Now man only “has an influence on the climate change process“. Wouldn’t you say that’s a very profound position correction by Spiegel? My, how the times have changed!
Of course Spiegel won’t admit this outright. They were probably hoping nobody would notice this slight position adjustment. Coming to terms with the fact that you had behaved like an irrational alarmist for decades is a long process that requires time. But Spiegel’s position trend on the climate issue is undeniable: going from a flooding catastrophe to some undefined influence.
In the 1980s, 90s and 2000s, Spiegel, convinced a climate catastrophe was coming fast, rolled out one alarmist report after the other. But by the end of the 2000s an article or two with skeptical tones started appearing. Stefan Rahmstorf reacted immediately to this thought emancipation and tried to bully Spiegel back into line. But nobody bullies Der Spiegel. The news magazine of German intellectuals followed with more skeptical articles, one even personally singled out and attacked Rahmstorf. Today Spiegel writer Axel Bojanowski, a geologist, writes regular articles that often pour cold water on irrational and alarmist climate scenarios.
Deniers Skeptics don’t deny (man-made) climate change. We are the ones who have been telling you it happens all the time! What we deny are the alarmism and the catastrophic scenarios. And yes, many among us are confident free markets are the way to go in coping with any change.
Yesterday’s online rant was perhaps written by a leftover alarmist and meant to take shots at American right-wing “deniers”. Oddly, and uncharacteristic of Spiegel, the piece was about old news from last year – perhaps fill-in for Easter. Lewandowsky’s paper has long since been discredited. The Spiegel author likely didn’t even bother Googling about it. Or, he/she just denied the facts.
In fact, the very people that Lewndowsky labels as deniers, those who he claims tend to believe the moon-landing was staged, include former NASA astronauts. The paper is just pure stupidity.
We can all agree with Spiegel’s new, sober position, and we very much welcome them joinng the denier more skeptical, rational, and critical position. Most of us will agree that you’d have to be a kook to believe that man doesn’t have some influence on climate through agriculture, land-use, aerosols, deforestation, etc. They might represent a couple percent of the skeptic ranks.
The real issue is: are we headed for a catastrophe of proportions depicted by the alarmists, e.g. Spiegel 1986? The answer clearly is no. Economic and civil suicide is not necessary. There’s plenty of time for the sensible upgrading of energy systems. In the meantime, go out and enjoy the Easter-time global warming.

Post by Dr. Ryan Maue (cross posted at my Policlimate)
“Must watch TV: Nye expounds on theory of racism”
Much “debate” has erupted in the liberal mainstream media concerning the effects of global warming on Hurricane Irene. With a few notable exceptions (Henry Fountain awesome), many of the journalists butchered the science and generally constructed disjointed narratives that quoted a variety of favorite experts which left me wondering why they even bother (Politico). Rush Limbaugh provided a compelling alternative explanation for the hurricane hype: “Politics is part of everything. The weather’s been politicized; the climate’s been politicized…Both Obama and the media were hoping for a disaster to revive his presidency and help prove climate change theory…The New York Times is trying to say that this violent hurricane is indeed indicative of global warming. It was a tropical storm when it left New York.”
But Bill Nye takes the “anti-science” crusade to a new level by showing up on Fox Business with my KFI 640 Saturday friend Charles Payne and embarrassing the hell out of himself. Once you watch the video and read the transcript, you will be left in amazement at his utter lack of comprehension of the topic at hand on national television! But, alas, Media Matters thinks Nye owned Payne (h/t to Andrew Revkin to Tweeted this). And CBS News headlines it as a story! Unbelievable!

The left actually thinks Bill Nye is a brilliant ambassador for their brand of global warming alarmism — a legitimate guy that understands the science and can articulate an explanation. However, Nye has no credentials or expertise with respect to global warming and hurricanes, at all. Not one iota.

Video is embedded or to go to CBS News and watch the Fox Business embedded video there. “Heady stuff, but Nye receives my respect for retaining his patience in outlining a life’s worth of work in a six-minute segment.” says Andrew Nusca. He has no idea that what Bill Nye is saying is disjointed and amateurish. Intricacies? Nye got almost everything wrong.
I transcribed my own transcript from the first 3 minutes of this (all I could take). Emphasis — bold and italics are my comments.
Charles Payne: While hurricane Irene brought more than just wind damage and flooding to the east coast, it’s revived a national debate as to whether global warming might be causing an increase in hurricanes and other extreme weather. In fact a recent cover story in Newsweek declared that this kind of wild weather may be quote “the new normal”. Here with insights on this is Bill Nye, otherwise known as the science guy.
Ok Bill, I’m going to come right at you. Um…Hurricane Irene – proof of global warming?
Bill Nye: Oh, I don’t think the word proof is what you are looking for – evidence of, a result of, yeah, yeah. Now here’s what the people will tell you that run these climate models. Now everybody, the word model in this usage is a computer program. A very sophisticated computer program. So you take data from satellites about the thickness of clouds and the extent of cloud-cover over the sea. You take data about the temperature of the sea surface. You take data about the existing weather say in North America or the Gulf of Mexico as this storm moves into it. Then you compute how much rain fell out of it, how much energy must have been put into it to create that much rain. It takes many months to analyze an event like Irene. Now the climate colleagues that I have will not tell you today that Irene was evidence or a result of climate change but check in with them about March next year after they have a few months to collect all of these millions and millions of data from weather services and satellites and compile them and run a climate model and show that Irene was a result of the world having more energy in the Earth’s atmosphere.
(Ryan: First of all, charitably, I think Nye is confusing a real-time operational weather forecast with a climate model. Climate models do not assimilate satellite observations of a given event — and it wouldn’t take months and months to compile the data. I have everything sitting on my server which generates my old FSU weather map page. Check back with them in March — that’s when they’ll have their climate model results back proving Irene was the result of more energy? This is a pretty unconventional way of doing climate or extreme event attribution. Bill Nye follows the “anti-scientific” method: I’ll give you the answer now, and then in 6-months, check back when I have the proof. )
CP: But here’s the thing here bill, ever since Katrina, right, we’ve heard that every year the hurricane season is going to be more devastating and apocalyptic, and the reality is we haven’t seen that. So how can Newsweek say “hey, this is a new normal”? is that irresponsible – is there any science behind that?
(Ryan: this is a great question by Payne. Since global hurricane activity — the number of storms, hurricanes, and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is at historical lows — collapsing since Katrina — as I showed in my recent GRL peer-reviewed paper, how on earth can you attribute one hurricane (Irene) to climate change.?)
BN: well there’s a lot more science behind that than just saying it’s not. But, uh, that aside. That’s only 6-years – in geologic time in terms of climate events, is not very long. Furthermore there is a lot of debate about this cool thing or remarkable thing is that the Sea-surface in the Pacific gets warmer, in the Pacific Ocean! Okay, tens of thousands of nautical miles away. As that gets warmer, it will strangely serve to decapitate certain hurricane or cyclonic storms off the coast of Africa – and actually get a few fewer hurricanes.
(Ryan: no kidding Nye, however, you haven’t come up with any science. Nye then launches into a tortured explanation of the El Nino Southern Oscillation warm phase — El Nino where the waters in the tropical Pacific cyclically become anomalously warm. But, it’s not “tens-of-thousands nautical miles away” — that’s more like the distance to the moon. There is actually little consensus in the climate community about the future of El Nino as the planet slowly warms. The CMIP3 models used for the IPCC AR4 report fail to reproduce historical ENSO events or variability, and therefore are useless prediction devices for the future. We already have a pretty good handle on the “teleconnection” effects of El Nino and La Nina on Atlantic hurricane development with research pioneered by Dr. Bill Gray and furthered by Dr. Phil Klotzbach who produces Colorado State’s seasonal hurricane forecasts. 2011 is a neutral-to-building La Nina year, so we should expect weaker vertical shear in the Main Development Region of the tropical Atlantic. It’s bizarre that Nye brought up El Nino which contradicts his original assertion that Irene was evidence of global warming.)
CP: But Bill, that’s not…
BN: This is another thing that’s very hard to show.
CP: But the Pacific Ocean, getting warmer, but that’s not from man.
(Ryan: excellent point again Charles. The tropical Pacific does not have a strong global warming signal over the past 30-years, which is due to the cyclical nature of ENSO on 2-7 year time scales. Our sea-surface temperature (SST) records get worse as you go backwards from the beginning of the satellite era in 1979. Nye has no answer.)
BN: (waving hands): you’re acting that you are dismissing those things like they they are not relevant.
(Ryan: Nye is defeated, and he knows it. After wagging his finger like Judge Judy, he pretty much has spent his arsenal of facts on this issue.)
CP: I’m not dismissing it, but you have so much information, I want to get to all of it. Are you saying though that it’s manmade, though?
BN: Well the world is getting warmer, uh, everybody, the world is getting warmer. I believe the debate is whether humans are causing it…Do we not agree that the world is getting warmer?
(Ryan: The world is getting warmer — so Irene has to be influenced by global warming. Maybe Irene did NOT reach its maximum potential because of global warming — has anyone considered that. Why must ALL of the climate change effects be a certain sign? Why didn’t Irene reach Category 5? Why did it weaken so fast if the SSTs were so warm? This is where the real tropical cyclone researchers will take over from the media hacks, and, yes, they will come with an answer in March. But, they will follow the “scientific” method and not the “I’ll get the proof later” Bill Nye “anti-science” method.)
CP: I have no idea. Someone told me that it’s warmed 1-degree over the past 100-years. I’ll take their word for it.
(Ryan: Charles is right.)
Show continues to talk about racism and shows the Al Gore “racism” clip – but Nye then really goes off into a different realm discussing that. I’m convinced that Fox News booked Nye knowing that he would butcher the science, and force me to write this post.

"**Christmas is often a frantic time for travel, with people rushing across the UK to be with loved ones for the holiday season.**
But now that Covid restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December, public transport is expected to be even busier than normal, as travel for the holidays is compressed into a five-day window.
And this year there will be no squeezing on to a packed train carriage. Trains, coaches and planes are all running at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing, with tickets often needing to be booked in advance.
The prospect of public transport being unable to cope with demand has prompted the government to appoint a Christmas travel tsar - Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy.
He is assessing whether road, rail and air networks are prepared enough for the onslaught of travellers during the festive window.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said plans were being made to minimise disruption, with further details being published next week ""once demand is clearer"".
He has warned that people should plan their routes carefully - and even consider not travelling at Christmas at all.
So what should you do if you're going to travel this year to spend Christmas with loved ones, and how might services be affected?
As is standard every year, there are no train services running on Christmas Day and only a very limited number of services running on a small number of routes on Boxing Day.
But for the days passengers can travel, they are being urged to book ahead and avoid busy times due to the combination of reduced capacity and the limited travel window. And some operators will prevent passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket.
There have already been reports of advance tickets selling out or going for exorbitant prices.
The good news is that operators say more advance tickets will soon be available, blaming the current shortage on changes to the timetable caused by the pandemic.
But the bad news is that tickets are expected to sell fast.
The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, advised people to keep checking for tickets and consider signing up for notifications from rail operators, some of whom will confirm when more fares are available.
Avanti West Coast, which operates trains on the West Coast Main Line, has said it is suspending peak fares between 18 December and the end of the year to help maintain social distancing on its trains.
This will slash the cost of many journeys on its network - for example, passengers buying a fully-flexible fare from Manchester to London during what is usually a peak period will be charged Â£64.40 instead of Â£180.
Mr Shapps has also revealed there are plans to run longer trains on the rail network, though we're yet to hear specifics about which routes these are planned for.
There are also annual Christmas rail works to contend with - though the majority of the network has been cleared of engineering works in a bid to avoid disruption.
However, Network Rail engineering works are taking place from 23 December to 4 January, with some railway lines closing to allow the work to take place.
London King's Cross station will be closed for six days from Christmas Day as a Â£1.2bn upgrade of the East Coast Main Line continues.
Network Rail is also warning of a ""significantly reduced service"" from 25 December to 4 January between Clapham Junction and London Waterloo because of major work.
But work scheduled for the festive period will be reviewed if passenger demand is high. However, government sources say it is unlikely that the major works on the East Coast Main Line and London King's Cross will be altered.
With trains likely to struggle with demand, coach operator National Express has said it will increase its services in the run-up to Christmas, having seen a ""significant"" increase in traffic to its website since the Christmas Covid rules were announced.
However, this still amounts to a reduced service, the operator said, with this year's Christmas Day timetable covering about 55% of the locations compared with 2019.
The operator said it will focus on major cities, towns and airports and expects demand for services to grow as more guidance about what we can do over Christmas is released by the government.
Megabus also said it had seen an increase in bookings over the past few days and expected demand to continue to grow.
Both will have a role in the mass exodus of students from universities between 3 and 9 December, aimed at minimising the risk of them spreading Covid-19 to their home areas.
Megabus said extra seats will be available from all the largest university campuses, cities and towns for students travelling home for Christmas, including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford, Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, Leeds, Norwich, Cardiff and Bristol.
National Express said it had increased capacity its usual routes that serve university locations and was speaking with universities about the possible need for special services.
Both operators will have services on Christmas Day.
Mr Shapps has also said the government is relaxing rules to allow more types of coaches to run over the festive period.
One upside for those travelling by road is that there are likely to be fewer roadworks than normal over the Christmas period.
The transport secretary said 500 miles of roadworks had been cleared on motorways and A-roads to ease any congestion.
Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021.
The RAC said its breakdown team is planning for the roads to be busy during the five-day period when coronavirus restrictions are eased, though it said it ""remains to be seen"" what the appetite for journeys would be this year.
The AA said it was not ""overly concerned"" that traffic congestion would occur on roads.
A survey it conducted found two-fifths of drivers had already cancelled festive travel plans.
EasyJet said it had already taken the decision to increase the number of seats on offer between London and Belfast, and London and Scotland over the Christmas period.
""We are operating flights in line with demand, which we will be monitoring over the coming days and are able to adjust our flight schedule accordingly,"" a spokesman said.
British Airways said it had seen an uptick in the numbers of people visiting its website looking at flights and holidays.
A spokesman said it would be putting on larger aircraft if needed, ""where possible"".
But Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would be operating a ""much-reduced schedule"" due to a ""lack of demand"" for air travel.
However, it said additional capacity had been added to key routes including Dublin to London Heathrow over the Christmas period."

 **Washington Needs to Adjust to the New Global Reality**



Historians agree that Britain’s rise as a pre‐​eminent global power came as a response to changing circumstances and not as a part of a grand master plan; Britain, it has been said, stumbled into an empire. But the converse was also true: the dismantling of the British Empire wasn’t a linear process involving a manageable and steady decline in its military and economic power; instead it had a haphazard muddling through quality. British leaders weren’t aware that Rule Britannia was already history even after the fat lady had sung that it was over.



Indeed, Prime Minister Winston Churchill who had led his nation into an impressive military victory in World War II, confident that the defeat of Nazi Germany would help save the British Empire, failed to recognize that the enormous military and economic costs of the war had actually created the conditions for the liquidation of the empire, starting with the withdrawal from Palestine and the “loss” of India after the war.



But while the sun was setting on the British Empire, members of its political elite continued to live under the illusion that their nation had remained a paramount global power. If you traveled in a time machine to London 1949 and attended a debate in the British Parliament, browsed through the pages of the _Times_ or listened to a BBC news program you would come across numerous references to Britain as a Great or “superpower,” a term that was applied to the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II. And if you encountered diplomats in His and (after 1953) Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service and bankers in the City of London, you wouldn’t be surprised if they continued to behave as though the world was still their domain to rule.



It was the humiliating abandonment of the Anglo‐​French invasion of Suez in collusion with Israel in 1956 that proved to be the turning point in Britain’s retreat from empire and ensured that London would never again attempt global military action without first securing the acquiescence of Washington. The time lag between the effective end of the British Empire and the recognition that indeed it was all over, proved to be quite lengthy.



The concept of “recognition lag” is familiar to economists. It refers to the time lag between when an actual economic shock, such as a sudden boom or bust, occurs and when it is recognized by economists, central bankers and the government, like when officials signal a recession in the economy several months after it has actually begun.



And just like changes in economic conditions, changes in the global status and power of nations, are not always immediately apparent, especially to the politicians and the generals who yield that power and to the journalists who cover them. That the elites continue to share such misconceptions about their nation’s ability to exert global influence has less to do with the power of inertia and more with the vested interests they have in maintaining the status‐​quo that could be threatened by challenges at home and abroad.



While no one is comparing the global political, economic and military status of the United States to that of Great Britain after World War II, there is an eerie resemblance between the resistance of officials, lawmakers and pundits in London 1949 and that of their contemporary counterparts in Washington 2009 to adjust their nation’s foreign policies to the changing global balance of power. That may explain why so many members of the U.S. foreign policy establishment seem to be so depressed in face of the Obama Administration’s current difficulties in dictating global developments, ranging from the military quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran’s nuclear aspirations and the deadlocked Israel/​Palestine peace process to the stalled negotiations on global trade liberalization (the Doha Round), the efforts to reach an international agreement on climate change and the global financial imbalances between the U.S. and China. Where is U.S. leadership on this or that global policy issue? Why can’t the Obama Administration “do something” to resolve this or that international crisis?



As expected, neoconservative critics depict President Barack Obama as an idealistic peacenik, if not a 1930’s-style appeaser. They blame the perceived erosion in U.S.’ ability to call the shots around the world on Obama’s alleged failure to stand‐​up to Russia (by abandoning the missile shield program in Eastern Europe), to Iran (by trying to engage it), to Venezuela (by shaking hands with Hugo Chavez) and to Al Qaeda (by overturning torture practices), and on his supposed betrayal of allies (Israel, Georgia, Poland, the Czech Republic). Not to mention Obama’s refusal to launch new crusades against Islamofascism, to promote the Freedom Agenda in the Greater Middle East and to annoy the commies in Beijing on a regular basis.



That’s rich coming from the guys at the _Weekly Standard_ and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). After all, it was the mess that the Bush administration, guided by these neoconservatives, had made in the Greater Middle East — where US military power was overstretched to the maximum, and where American policies helped strengthen Iran and its surrogates in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine — coupled with the dramatic loss of American financial resources, that has produced a long‐​term transformation in the balance of power in the Middle East and worldwide, and has significantly eroded Washington’s geo‐​strategic and geo‐​economic clout. In fact, the increasing wariness of the American public regarding new US military interventions, as a consequence of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the expanding U.S. deficits would have made it difficult even for a President John McCain to promote an aggressive U.S. policy in the Middle East and elsewhere.



That Obama finds it so difficult to press Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Afghanistan’s Hamid Karzai to change their policies may have to do with the fact that unlike many of the elites in Washington, the above and other foreign leaders have succeeded in deconstructing the current geo‐​strategic reality and recognized that the global balance of power has been shifting and that U.S. ability to exert its diplomatic and military leverage over them has been constrained. Let’s hope that these changes will also be recognized in Washington as soon as possible, and that unlike the leaders of the British Empire, those in charge of Pax Americana will have enough time to readjust to the new global reality.

"**The government's Test and Trace app has given a women the results of a Covid test she said she had not taken.**
Elaine Watson, from Middlesbrough, was told by the app to self-isolate for seven days and then, on day six, that her test had come back negative.
""I'm thinking, what do you mean a test? I haven't had a test,"" she said.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the app was constantly being improved in response to feedback but most users had ""no issues"" with it.
Ms Watson, a member of BBC staff, said she was not contacted by Test and Trace and had not taken a coronavirus test because she had no symptoms.
""Was that message meant for somebody else? Did I really need to isolate?"" she asked.
Other people have said they were sent results for tests they had not taken and some have taken a test but received no result.
Alex Weedon, from Colchester, was emailed by Test and Trace to say he had coronavirus, despite not having taken a test.
Trying to track down who the intended recipient had been was ""baffling"", he said.
Test and Trace has failed to contact about 19% of people whose cases have been passed to it after testing positive.
Between 28 May, when it launched, and 18 November nearly 17% (160,569) were not contacted. For 20,091 of these, ""communication details not provided"" was given as the reason.
The DHSC said everyone who tested positive was informed, but it was not clear on how a person's contact details could become ""not provided"" between them being informed and their case being passed to contact tracers.
British Medical Association North East chairman Dr George Rae asked why contact tracers could not call the person on the number used to text them their results.
""That doesn't make any sense at all, does it?"" he said.
One contact tracer from Teesside, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was not able to reach about 60% of the people he tried to contact.
""It is probably even higher than 60% that aren't reached, but I try to be at least a little optimistic,"" he said.
Another contact tracer said there was ""no clear guideline"" on how many attempts should be made before giving up.
If a person could not be reached there was no way of knowing whether the tracer had the correct number, he said.

"Three years ago, government plans to privatise the forests met with strong opposition from community groups and NGOs.  But there have been calls for change – among others the Woodland Trust has called for legislation that would afford the public forest estate greater protection from privatisation, and there are expectations that the Queen’s Speech will include an announcement of proposed legislation to “conserve and enhance” the forests. We will learn more about the government’s intention in upcoming weeks, but it takes only a bit of history to have mixed feelings about the proposition. It has to do with the words “conserve and enhance”. And it has to do with the government. Forests were subjects of government control long before states were thinking about things like income taxes. Rulers have tried various approaches over the centuries, and usually these shed a revealing light on their overarching ambitions. Show me your woodlands, and I will tell you what your government is up to. Authorities can focus on wood or game for hunting, they can over-exploit forests or preserve them for future generations, or they can reduce oversight and allow people to do their thing. And unlike many politicians, woodlands have a long memory, and they do not lie. Forests bear the effects of past policies over many generations.  A strong European tradition has focused on timber production, and securing a reliable supply of timber was a matter of national and economic security. Countries with a powerful state administrations such as Germany and France were particularly eager to manage their woodlands systematically. They issued edicts for wood production, controlled supplies and markets, and created government-run schools for foresters. For most of world history, rulers have shown their power by cutting down forests, because of their value as a resource and because forests were places where people could escape their control. European governments were different, and displayed power by preserving forests and guiding their use in what they perceived as the common interest. In other words, they sought to “conserve and enhance” the forests. Sound familiar? Governments of the early modern era strongly favoured timber production, as selling forest products was an important source of revenue. That had consequences for the way forests looked, as the quest for timber products favoured tall and fast-growing species. It also meant a ban on all non-monetary uses – specifically the traditional allowances for locals to make use of forest resources. This led to generations of conflict between governments and the people for control of the forests. Over the course of the 19th century, many European governments gained the upper hand and controlled the woodlands, but it became a rather ambiguous victory. The penchant for tall, fast-growing trees brought with them a wide range of problems. Game hunters voiced their own concerns, preserving a whiff of feudalism into the modern era. Nature lovers sought to preserve views and landscapes. And it is a matter of debate whether optimising domestic wood production was a good idea in an age of world trade. Forests mirrored society’s obsessions almost as reliably as those of the government. Environmentalism has made the issue even more complicated. Forests are hotspots of biological diversity. Climate change will affect tree growth, and introduce different pests, while also highlighting their potential as carbon sinks. Strong winds or ice can cut down elaborate forest management plans overnight. In spite of strenuous efforts against acid rain, pollution is still a major problem. Nitrogen oxides have received some attention for their impact on the climate, but they also contribute to a chronic over-fertilisation of soils that puts habitats in jeopardy by boosting unnatural growth. Governments can no longer choose what they perceive as the crucial use of forests and ignore all other claims. Today’s governments need to meet a multitude of goals: economic viability, scenic value, resilience to disasters, climate effects, biodiversity, and all this when the ground is constantly shifting. We do not know Britain’s climate in 50 years, or the effects of higher carbon dioxide concentrations on forests. Nor, looking from the environmental to the economic, can we guess what timber prices will be in 2064. So this makes it remarkable that the government wants to pick up the issue – but then it remains to be seen what “conserving” and “enhancing” forests actually means. Will they face up to challenge in full, or merely focus on monetary returns? There is plenty of evidence around the world to show what neo-liberal policies and short-term thinking can do to forests, and equally plenty of evidence of protests against it. We will learn soon more about the government’s idea of the right forest. We may also see another round of protests. But then, we will also learn something about ourselves in the process: we are out in the woods when it comes to the future of forests. Maybe we do not so much need a bill as an invitation to experts and the public: we need to talk."
"**Bristol's biggest sports stadium has been earmarked as a site for mass coronavirus vaccinations.**
Ashton Gate, home of Bristol City FC and the Bristol Bears rugby team, will become the regional vaccination centre for the city and surrounding area.
It is predicted as many 110,000 people per week could be be vaccinated there, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).
Regulators have yet to approve a vaccine.
If one is approved the Ashton Gate programme would prioritise people over 50, and frontline health workers.
The plan was in a report presented to University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Trust (UHBW) board on Friday.
Robert Woolley, chief executive of UHBW, which runs the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol Children's Hospital and Weston General, told board members preparations were ""moving very fast.""
""It [vaccine approval] is subject to Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority approval but if that is fast tracked as we expect then we are gearing up to be able to start vaccinating staff and any other priorities that are advised to us nationally in December.""
According to the report, Ashton Gate would be open 12 hours a day, seven days a week and the programme would be overseen by North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT).
Patients from Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire would be vaccinated at the stadium.
Jenny Bowker, head of primary care development for the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG, said that everyone over 50 and other high-risk groups would be seen first, with over-80s and care home residents and staff at the front of the queue.
Addressing South Gloucestershire Council's Health Scrutiny Committee on 25 November, she said GPs should be ready ""within weeks"" to take part in vaccinations, although it was not certain which vaccine would be available first."

There is no more reliable rule than the 95% rule: 95% of what you read about economics and finance is either wrong or irrelevant. Just reflect for a moment on the most frequently repeated lessons drawn from the Great Depression (1929–33). According to most accounts, the stock market crash of October 1929 was the spark that sent the economy spiraling downward.



How could this be? After all, by November 1929, the stock market had started to recover, and by mid‐​April 1930, it had reached its pre‐​crash level. Contrary to the received wisdom, massive government failure — not the stock market crash — pushed the United States into the Great Depression. It was the Federal Reserve that ushered in that terrible nightmare. During the course of the Great Depression, the money supply contracted by 25%. This sent the economy into a deflationary death spiral, with the price level falling 25%.



The Federal Reserve was not the only culprit. In the name of saving jobs, the Smoot‐​Hawley trade bill became law in June 1930. That intervention increased U.S. tariffs by over 50%. It was quickly followed by the imposition of retaliatory tariffs in 60 other countries. In consequence, world trade collapsed and the unemployment rate in the U.S. surged from 7.8% in June 1930 to 24.7% in 1933.



In addition to the Smoot‐​Hawley tariff wedge, the Hoover administration and the Democratic Congress imposed the largest tax increase in U.S. history, with the top tax rate on income jumping from 25% to 63% in 1932. If these government policies weren’t destructive enough, the Roosevelt administration’s New Deal created regime uncertainty because major policies were being changed so rapidly. As a result, investors were afraid to commit funds to new projects and private investment collapsed.





Far from saving the patient, government intervention came close to killing it. But you wouldn’t know it from listening to the current discourse about the Panic of 2008-09. Indeed, politicians and pundits throughout the world have unfortunately dialed back to the Great Depression and drawn on the false lessons of history for policy guidance and justifications for their mega‐​interventions.



In consequence, the key enabler of both the Great Depression and the Panic of 2008-09 — namely the Federal Reserve — is scheduled to become America’s systemic risk regulator. This is the world upside down. The Federal Reserve is the systemic risk.



The true lesson to be drawn from business cycle history is that, if left to run their natural course, severe downturns are followed by rapid snapbacks. For example, during the 1921 recession, wholesale prices, industrial production, and manufacturing employment fell by 30% or more, reaching their low in mid‐​1921. But, absent government intervention, the economy recovered naturally, and by early 1922, it had fully recovered, from its mid‐​1921 low.



Never mind. The crisis has energized the interventionists. One of the most hyper‐​active is French President Nicolas Sarkozy. In addition to leading the charge to impose wage controls on top bankers, he has grand visions. He wants to move away from the “fetichism of GDP”. The Sarkozy conjecture is that GDP metrics don’t measure “happiness”.



To correct that alleged flaw, President Sarkozy appointed a “Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress”. It is led by two Nobel laureates: Columbia University’s Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard’s Amartya Sen. The Commission’s report, which was issued in September 2009, presents the known shortcomings associated with national income accounting, including the GDP metrics. That said, the Commission failed to produce any new, reliable measures that account for overall economic health. The commission will, no doubt, go down as a typical Sarkozy fireworks display, with no measured “happiness” at the end of the performance.



For the foreseeable future, GDP metrics, as well as other standard economic measures, will remain center stage for economists and policy makers. President Hu of China made this clear in a speech on climate change before the U.N. General Assembly in September 2009. While bowing to “greenery”, China’s President Hu stressed that developing countries should “go for growth”.







This was a cold shower for President Sarkozy and other interventionists. After all, GDP growth and levels of GDP per capita are closely, and positively, associated with metrics that measure the vitality of free markets and the ease of doing business (see the accompanying table). And that’s not all. Economic growth is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. As the accompanying chart indicates, prosperity (measured by standard metrics) affects life expectancy (health) in a positive way.



A reliable picture of an economic state of affairs can be obtained by constructing a misery index using standard measures: the sum of the inflation rate, plus the lending (interest) rate, plus the unemployment rate, minus the annual percentage change in GDP per capita.



As an example, the misery index for New Zealand is presented in the accompanying chart for the period 1980–2008.



By the early 1980s, New Zealand’s economy was suffering from interventionism and its misery index was at record levels. Then Roger Douglas took over the reins at the Ministry of Finance and pushed through dramatic free‐​market reforms.



These set the stage for a significant initial fall in New Zealand’s misery index. The second stage of the decline in the index occurred during Ruth Richardson’s tenure as Minister of Finance in 1991–93, when she pushed through a number of additional liberal economic reforms. In late 1999, the Labour Party, with Helen Clarke at the helm, took power in New Zealand, where it stayed entrenched until November 2008. During that long stretch, the dramatic economic reforms of the late‐​1980s and early‐​1990s were eroded away and New Zealand’s misery index more than doubled.



President Hu took note of the main lesson of economic history: “go for free markets” and prosperity and longevity will follow.

We are all aware of Stuff’s evangelistic global warming crusade where some weird individuals, who quite frankly are of little or no significance, actually believe they are celestial demigods when it comes to predicting the future of global warming. 



The first thing that struck me was that, by virtue of being employed by _Stuff,_ that immediately disqualified them from making the claim on their CVs of being journalists. A prophet, clairvoyant or even a palmist would more accurately represent their qualifications, yet we are expected to take them seriously and are not permitted to challenge their superior intellect. I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but my blade can determine the difference between slicing through a block of ice and the threading of newsprint.



Is climate changing? Possibly. Can humanity intervene? I don’t think so. There is a deliberate interweaving of global warming and the need to protect our environment and it is the annexing of these two issues that have diluted the urgency and our desire to take environmental issues more seriously. 



I have travelled throughout the world over many years; and the planet, quite frankly, is a dump. Man/woman-made filth. If governments and activists want to be taken seriously **they need to abandon this tripe about global warming and put their energy into fixing the environment.** It is only then that they should be acknowledged and believed. 



Humanity created the mess, so humanity can address it. Let mother nature do what she does best; she is the thermometer of the universe. Not _Stuff_ nor socialists.



15,000 readers responded to Stuff’s climate survey and 160,000 voted Green at the last election. When it’s likely that more than **90% of Green supporters ignored Stuff’s global warming survey** , you know your BS is spread very thin.

"**Opposition MPs in Denmark have urged the government to dig up millions of mink that were buried in mass graves amid Covid-19 fears.**
The two burial sites in Jutland are highly controversial - one is near a bathing lake and the other not far from a source of drinking water.
The discovery of a mutated form of the virus prompted a cull of nearly 17 million mink, devastating the Danish fur industry - the largest in the EU.
The burial decision was judged illegal.
The new Agriculture Minister, Rasmus Prehn, said on Friday he supported the idea of exhuming the mink and incinerating them. But that would require the environmental protection agency's approval, he added.
His predecessor Mogens Jensen resigned last week in the furore over the government's legal basis for the cull, as more than 10,000 tonnes of dead mink were hastily buried.
Denmark's DR news reports that about 11 million mink have been culled so far.
**Warning: you may find a picture below showing a burial site disturbing**
The government has admitted that the cull was mishandled. The grisly mass burial got even more macabre when there were reports of buried mink resurfacing because of the nitrogen and phosphorus gases produced by their decay.
The two mass graves are near Karup and Holstebro.
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen wept on Danish TV while visiting a mink farm on Thursday.
""We have two generations of really skilled mink farmers, father and son, who in a very, very short time have had their life's work shattered, and thatâ¦ It's been emotional for them. Sorry. For me as well,"" she said, wiping away tears.
Law experts quoted by Danish TV2 say the government went ahead with mass burial without getting an environmental impact assessment.
The opposition Liberal Party (Venstre) says the mink should be dug up and loaded into containers of manure, which would allegedly be a safer disposal method.
Environment Minister Lea Wermelin spoke to parliament - the Folketing - on Friday, in a crisis session called to deal with the mink problem.
She admitted that mass burial had not been the best method - incineration would have been preferable - but the spread of Covid-19 on mink farms had made the disposal urgent and there had been no other quick way to handle such a quantity of dead animals.
On Danish TV, the Liberals' environment spokesman Thomas Danielsen said ""this is a case full of errors and illegalities"".
A Socialist People's Party (SF) MP for West Jutland, Signe Munk, called the buried mink ""a ticking environmental bomb"" and said ""the mink must be removed"".
The head of the mink breeders' association, Tage Pedersen, said the cull spelt doom for Danish fur producers - a sector employing about 6,000 people and worth $800m (Â£600m) annually in exported pelts, Reuters news agency reported.
Denmark has about 1,100 mink farms - and so far no compensation deal has been decided."
"It was day two of our 18 day trek to Everest’s Base Camp when in the afternoon our head guide Lhakpa Nurbu Sherpa sombrely reported to me that 16 Sherpas had been killed in an avalanche on the mountain. I was leading a group of university students as part of a course I teach in human-nature interactions in high alpine environments. The news confirmed what I had been suspecting since earlier in the day as a result of the unusual flurry of helicopters around the mountains. While death and despair are common in the Everest region, this accident was especially tragic, as it is the largest number of lives ever to be claimed in one go on the mountain.  One of my students and I had been researching mountaineering deaths in the region, and had wondered how do locals and tourists view the grave sites along the route to Base Camp. But it never occurred to us that we would see the events unfold up close and personal, and that our research would take a different turn. So, during the next 16 days of trekking, I started talking to local Sherpas about various lifestyles and livelihoods on Everest that put human lives at imminent risk. I started wondering how humanity would respond to the news from this faraway land. My first reaction was not so much about those who died but was about those the dead ones left behind – a fatherless child, a young widow, a god-fearing father, a grieving mother.  The other reaction I had was how news gets distorted in the media. CNN reported Sherpas revolting on Everest, a completely fictitious account of the very real events that were unfolding in front of our own eyes. There was also the pathetic initial response of the Nepalese government that it would provide compensation of just 40,000 Nepali Rupees (less than US$500) to each of the victims’ families. Could all this have been avoided? Those who died were ferrying supplies between the two camps and the routes were becoming increasingly crowded so the porters had to slow down and got caught in the avalanche. The scientist in me wanted to blame the unstable snow conditions – snow accumulation during last winter on Everest slopes were considered above normal – or the crowd of climbers that had gathered at the base of that unforgiving mountain. Still others, and this included many local Sherpas, thought the high altitude porters brought this upon themselves. Sherpas talked about how high altitude Sherpa porters are exploited by Western and local climbing companies.  A consistent theme in local interpretations for why this took place is that climbing Everest is no longer authentic. It’s become something people want to tick off their life’s “bucket list” – an endeavour of ego enhancement and greed of mostly Western climbers who often ignore basic rules of mountaineering safety for themselves and their support team. Despite being crucial to the operation, Sherpa porters are on the lowest rung of mountaineers’ hierarchy, are often paid a pitiful salary (relative to the risk of dying), do not have adequate insurance coverage, and are treated by their own government with indifference. And there is the spiritual side of explanation to these events. Our own guide Lhakpa and some of the Sherpa lodge owners whom I talked to thought that the young porters today are oblivious to the spiritual connections that elder Sherpas have had with the mountains – and the respect which accompanies it. Indeed, the Everest region is dotted with sacred mountains, landscapes, Buddhist monasteries, religious objects and spiritual symbols.  The younger generation of Sherpas are less concerned with the spiritual side of the mountain. The younger generation Sherpas (some of those who died were barely out of their teen years) are lured by “easy” money hoping to make a quick go at the mountain to never return to face its wrath next year. They are lured again once the money runs out, and the cycle continues.  The 17 of us were reminded again of the deadly impact the mountain can have. In Chukung, below the slopes of Mt. Lhotse, we witnessed the frantic search for a trekker from Slovakia who had vanished during his excursion to a nearby glacier (as of May 3 – the last day of our trek in the region – he was still missing). Or, the trekker from India who had died two days earlier in the lodge next to ours in Tengboche, waiting for a helicopter to rescue him as he had succumbed to acute mountain sickness. Similarly, a Chinese trekker had to be airlifted from Everest Base Camp, as he too experienced the same malady. How many more deaths should the local community endure till they spring into action? The saga of death and despair on Mount Everest unfolds anew and seems to reach new proportions every year, as more and more people flock to the mountain. It’s time stricter limits were introduced to the mountain and safety of those conducting expeditions put above all else. The Nepalese government, international climbers and guides, and the local Sherpas must work together to develop sound policies and action plans to address issues of risk, safety, adequate life insurance and financial compensation. Above all, they must ensure that the mountains are treated with respect and fear. First things first, they should limit the number of climbing permits and make the mountain less accessible – not the other way around. Only by making the Everest climbing experience exclusive and targeted to climbing professionals, who’ve shown the mettle required to scale this deadly summit, can safety be improved and tragedies prevented."
"Parts of the UK had more than a month’s rain in one day on Monday June 10. More rain on the following Tuesday, particularly in the north of England and Midlands, created localised flooding. Sinkholes appearing on the M25 – one of Europe’s busiest motorways – and closed train lines have created expensive travel chaos. The flooding of hospitals and other essential services has even put lives at risk. In the middle of all this, groundwater levels across the country are much lower than normal. There’s been little rain between 2018 and 2019 – the winter was drier than normal and it wasn’t so long ago that Britain was basking in one of the warmest Easter weekends on record. Still yellowing lawns suggest that hardly any rain has fallen since. This isn’t an usual pattern of weather and it isn’t specifically linked to climate change. Slow-moving, intense bands of rainfall can emerge in the summer, though wetter Junes can possibly be linked to climate change as the jet stream – which is responsible for steering much of the weather systems we get over Britain – changes due to a warming atmosphere. You might expect the dry ground to soak up all the water, but it hasn’t for several reasons. The rainfall has been so intense that the ground can’t soak it up fast enough. So many of the surfaces in urban areas of the UK are paved over and don’t allow water to soak through naturally, causing huge amounts of run-off. Smaller rivers respond very quickly to heavy rainfall, which is why we have seen many smaller rivers and tributaries bursting their banks and causing localised flooding. Many of the flood warnings in place in the north of England and Midlands are for tributaries and smaller rivers with names that many people have never heard of before, but these often flow through urban areas and close to homes and businesses. Whatever the river is called, it’s not much fun when it’s flowing through your kitchen. The bigger rivers on the other hand, such as the Thames and Severn take much longer to respond to heavy rain and will only flood when water tables are much higher than they are at present. Lower groundwater levels mean that larger rivers are able to swallow up extra water without too much trouble. If rain keeps up for another month or two, we could be in trouble. This is what happened during the winter of 2013-14, when months of rain meant the Thames flooded towns like Oxford, Staines and Wraysbury, and low-lying parts of Somerset resembled a lake. What does this mean? It’s a reminder that floods are pretty simple – lots of rain very often equals flooding, no matter what has happened with the weather in previous weeks and months. It also shows that floods are made worse by the way people have changed the landscape – paving over areas so that water runs off the ground too quickly, creating floods that are essentially human-made. Floods are only a problem when people are in the way of them. Britain needs to build more homes, but where and how many will affect the risk of more floods in future. There are still plans to build homes on floodplains, which we should avoid. The construction of sustainable drainage systems – ditches and ponds that hold back water where it falls and prevent heavy rain from rushing into rivers too quickly – hasn’t gone far enough. Dealing with flooding is a team effort – it requires collaboration between flood authorities, landowners, homeowners, community groups, and local and national government. Only by working together can effective action be taken. People very often have good local knowledge about flooding. They know when and where it will flood, and can sometimes be perplexed when “experts” tell them otherwise. Much of the political fallout during the 2013-14 flooding was not due to the damage itself, but anger from communities who felt abandoned or ignored. As the UK commits to limit future climate change by setting emissions targets, people must consider the costs of the climate change people are already experiencing. This means changing how we live our lives, not just to prevent future floods but to deal with floods when they next occur. We must prepare better for floods, not just for the next decade, but for those next week. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd a project that involves the such can only be called one thing: really dumb. Before other countries dive into renewable energies, drunk on green fantasies, they should take a look at what is happening in Germany. Indeed, sobriety helps.
The online Die Welt had a piece on the spiraling electricity costs in Germany a couple of weeks ago.

Germany’s “moon-landing” energy project risks crash-landing on Earth. Photo credit: Andrew Marino at en.wikipedia.
Transforming the energy supply system to one that will be based on 80% renewable energy by 2050 is considered Germany’s moon-landing project. Unfortunately it risks crash-landing right here on Earth.
Skyrocketing costs and growing supply uncertainties are putting the German government under massive pressure. The project has been riddled by a complete lack of planning and management. The reason for that of course is because real planning involves honest analysis, which reveals what is feasible and what isn’t. The proponents of green energy simply did not want the answer to that question. So they skipped the planning altogether and dove into it blindly.
Today intermittent wind and sun are causing Germany’s power grid to fluctuate so wildly that the government is now forced to implement drastic measures. For example, industry will be compensated for damages, at the consumers’ expense, when they have to shut down their operations to in order to prevent a grid collapse (of the sort we saw in Munich some weeks ago).
Die Welt writes that chemical, aluminum and steel plants consuming massive amounts of energy will have to shut down or scale back during periods when the power supply is lacking. For the ‘capacity that can be shut down’ “experts have recommended the appropriate compensation of 2000 euros per megawatt and year. But industry will receive 20,000 euros/MW for shutting down. (…] ten times the amount. Thanks to a government that will make the consumers pay anything to keep the scam going.

While the politicians keep passing all the high costs to consumers, they turn around and have the gall to publicly insist that electricity has to remain affordable in Germany.
According to Die Welt, consumers will also be liable for the costs of offshore windparks in the event of construction delays or inabilities by the grid to absorb the power they produce. The result, writes Die Welt: “The price of electricity, now the second-highest in Europe, will continue to rise.” Germany’s attraction for business investment is losing its luster.
Even green energy producers see costs going out of control
The providers of green energy are waking up to the reality. Die Welt writes:

Also the Association of New Energy Providers (BNE), who actively promoted the end of nuclear energy and the switch to renewables, is sobering up. ‘Instead of constantly coming up with new fees, charges, subsidies, exemptions and other market-foreign cash flows, the German government must now boldly plan the switchover to the system,’ demands BNEChief Robert Busch: ‘Otherwise we are going to lose the battle against the costs and the energy transformation will drown in a sea of subsidies.'”

Die Welt predicts more continuing rapid cost increases for consumers, thanks to the Energieeinsparverordnung (EneV), which will go into effect in 2014 and mandates tough thermal insulation standards for buildings. “Rental costs will be driven higher and higher,” warns Axel Gedaschko, President of the Federal Association of German Apartment Companies (GdW). “Already now in large cities there’s a massive problem of offering affordable living space for low-income families.”
Little wonder 600,000 households have seen their power get cut off. The green revolution is producing social injustice that is casting the poorest out in the cold.

From the Heartland Institute, they call out the Center for American Progress for posting falsehoods, but invite them to the conference anyway. Class act.

Liberal Think Tank’s ‘Prebuttal’ Gets Facts Wrong About The Heartland Institute, Climate Conference
Today at 2 p.m. EDT — a day before The Heartland Institute opens its Sixth International Conference on Climate Change, (ICCC-6) — the Center for American Progress will host a conference call to offer what amounts to a “prebuttal” to Heartland’s event.
The following comments by Jim Lakely, director of communications for The Heartland Institute, may be used for attribution. For additional comments, email Jim Lakely at jlakely@heartland.org or call 312/377-4000. For information on Heartland’s climate conference — held June 30 and July 1 at the Marriott Wardman Park in Washington, DC — visit the conference Web page. To register for media credentials for the conference, click here.

“This is ‘progress,’ all right — for The Heartland Institute,” Lakely said. “For years, the global warming alarmists thought the best counter-strategy to The Heartland Institute’s climate conferences was to ignore them. No matter how many scientists we brought in to talk about what the observational and historical data say about the climate, the enviro-left’s strategy never wavered — until now. This is proof Heartland’s years-long effort to help restore the scientific method to the debate is cutting through the fog of politics and panic.
“I want to take this opportunity to invite staffers from the Center for American Progress to ICCC-6, as well as the folks who will be countering Heartland’s conference on their press call,” Lakely said. “There’s time allotted for Q&A after every presentation, and the scientists in attendance will gladly field their questions.”
(You can watch Heartland’s climate conference live starting at
8:30 a.m. Thursday, June 30 and Friday, July 1.)
Lakely adds it is a “myth” that only skeptics are invited to Heartland climate conferences.
“We always invite the ‘other side,’ but few accept the challenge,” Lakely said.
One scholar who accepted the challenge, atmospheric scientist Scott Denning of Colorado State University, made a point to mention how well he and his views were received at ICCC-4 in Chicago last year and urged his colleagues to join him. Heartland’s YouTube page has a four-minute clip of Denning’s remarks here. Some excerpts:
“I learned a lot here. … I actually feel that it’s really too bad that more of my colleagues from the scientific community didn’t attend this, and haven’t in the past. And I hope we can remedy that in the future. … We can learn quite a bit from each other. … I think the most important thing that we have in common is the following: that we think we need public policy that is based on facts, rather than facts that are based on a policy agenda.”
The Center for American Progress press release has another error of fact. The organization’s Christina DiPasquale writes: “The Heartland Institute, a conservative group funded by Exxon Mobil and Charles Koch …”
“This is a common and inaccurate charge of the left when mentioning The Heartland Institute,” Lakely said. “ExxonMobil has not contributed to Heartland since 2006 — and even then, the company’s gifts were modest. In addition, the Kochs have not sent money Heartland’s way for more than a decade. And neither ‘bogeyman’ of the left is funding this conference, nor has funded any of Heartland’s past conferences. None of the organizations Heartland listed as cosponsors contribute toward the cost of these events, either.”
More information on The Heartland Institute’s funding can be found here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterImagine if the sugar and butter industries took over nutritional sciences. It wouldn’t be long before fruits and vegetables turned out to be the most dangerous foods on the planet.
When it comes to climate science and energy policy, a similar absurdity is taking place, i.e. the environmentalists are taking over energy policy-making. Canadian investigative journalist Donna Laframboise has uncovered it, and FOX NEWS here has the report: “Leaked UN climate report slammed for citing WWF, Greenpeace“.
Fox writes:
Critics are blasting a draft U.N. climate change report that combines studies by advocacy groups like the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace alongside scientific research papers — the same issue that led independent auditors to slam the U.N.’s last report.
‘You’d think that the IPCC would have learned its lesson, that it would have told its authors not to rely on these sorts of publications,’ said Donna Laframboise, the head of nofrakkingconsensus.com, an investigative website skeptical of the scientific consensus on global warming.
‘The report currently includes, amongst its list of references, nine separate publications produced wholly or in part by the WWF,’ Laframboise told FoxNews.com. ‘The report currently includes nine separate publications produced wholly or in part by the WWF.'”

So nothing has changed at the IPCC. In it’s 2007 report, advocacy and activists groups were cited throughout. The science isn’t convincing enough and so the IPCC is resorting to scientifically unfounded exaggerations from advocacy groups who are pushing a sole agenda. FOX NEWS quotes John Christy, climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville:
“In general, I don’t think reports by advocacy groups are credible.”
Laframboise adds.
The real issue is that all of the evidence is being evaluated either by people who embrace an activist worldview, or who don’t consider an activist worldview to be at odds with rigorous science. […] The IPCC sees nothing wrong with activist perspectives. That’s what gives the game away. That’s what tells us that what’s going on at the IPCC is not science.”

If governments continue to pile on more and more debt, when will they reach the tipping point? The Greeks appear to be close to the tipping point, and it is only a matter of time before other European countries, and eventually even the United States, begin their fiscal death spiral. 



The Greek government’s unwillingness to make the hard choices necessary to put its fiscal house in order in the past few weeks has caused investors to demand a 2.5 percent premium on its government‐​issued Eurobonds over those issued by the German government. 



First, a little background. Eurozone governments have a contractual obligation not to incur annual deficits of more than 3 percent, yet the deficit forecast for 2010 for all major Eurozone economies is far in excess of that number. Greece (12.2 percent), Ireland (14.7 percent) and the U.K. (at 12.9 percent) are even in double digits. As can be seen in the accompanying table, the average Eurozone deficit is projected to be 6.9 percent, more than double the agreed‐​upon limit. 



Greece has reached a crisis stage and, as noted, its debt is now selling at a deep discount compared to other EU countries. Ireland has a bigger deficit, but its total net government debt is only 38 percent, as contrasted with Greece’s 95 percent. But the Irish, unlike the Greeks, are instituting a credible plan to cut government spending and get their economy back on the growth track. 



The fundamental problem with most of the world’s largest economies is that they have allowed government spending to grow faster than economic growth, which can only lead to long‐​run economic disaster. 



Many governments are proposing tax increases, but they cannot tax their way out of this problem because most of their tax rates are already above their long‐​run revenue‐​maximizing rate. 



Further tax increases will only result in even slower economic growth and an increase in the underground economy, making the fiscal situation worse rather than better. The responsible choice is a radical cut in government spending growth, with the alternative being economic stagnation or worse, likely coupled with a high rate of inflation. 



Japan has tried to spend itself into prosperity by issuing more and more debt. Up until now, it has avoided inflation but has suffered a decade of economic stagnation, with a falling share of world gross domestic product, and the situation can only get worse. 



The Obama administration and the Congress are in a headlong rush to push the country over the fiscal tipping point. The fiscal tipping point is the point where the interest that premium bond buyers are demanding to compensate them for the risk of default and/​or accelerating inflation causes the total interest cost to be so high that the government is borrowing just to pay the interest. This is equivalent to a family being so far in debt that it is borrowing just to pay the interest on its mortgage, credit cards, etc. 



The proposed health care plan and the environmental cap‐​and‐​trade scheme will add trillions of dollars to the U.S. debt over the next few years and, in all likelihood, soon will drive the total debt burden to well over 100 percent of GDP. Even if the administration were to tax the “rich” at 100 percent of their incomes, there would still not be enough money to pay for all of these spending schemes. 



The following should be known to most members of Congress. The size of the U.S. government is already well over the welfare and economic growth‐​maximizing rate. Taxes on upper‐​income Americans are well above the revenue‐​maximizing rate. Thus, for those in the political class to further increase the size of government and government debt as a percentage of GDP is grossly irresponsible. It is almost as if they had a death wish for the country. 



Humans are quite good at adapting to climate change. Our species has already lived through hundreds of climate cycles. What they are not good at is adapting to the fiscal and monetary falsehoods of politicians. Yet, the politicians would prefer to fly around the world talking about climate change rather than putting their fiscal house in order. 



Bond buyers are not stupid. They can see what is happening. If the administration and Congress do not soon reverse course, the cost of servicing the debt will quickly drive the U.S. to the fiscal tipping point. 



Once the tipping point is reached, government will shrink one way or another, because there will be no way to fund the previous bloated state. Who will be most hurt? Those most dependent on government.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
There’s a lovely 2005 paper I hadn’t seen, put out by the Los Alamos National Laboratory entitled “Our Calibrated Model has No Predictive Value” (PDF).
Figure 1. The Tinkertoy Computer. It also has no predictive value.
The paper’s abstract says it much better than I could:
Abstract: It is often assumed that once a model has been calibrated to measurements then it will have some level of predictive capability, although this may be limited. If the model does not have predictive capability then the assumption is that the model needs to be improved in some way.
Using an example from the petroleum industry, we show that cases can exist where calibrated models have no predictive capability. This occurs even when there is no modelling error present. It is also shown that the introduction of a small modelling error can make it impossible to obtain any models with useful predictive capability.
We have been unable to find ways of identifying which calibrated models will have some predictive capacity and those which will not.
There are three results in there, one expected and two unexpected.

The expected result is that models that are “tuned” or “calibrated” to an existing dataset may very well have no predictive capability. On the face of it this is obvious—if we could tune a model that simply then someone would be predicting the stock market or next month’s weather with good accuracy.
The next result was totally unexpected. The model may have no predictive capability despite being a perfect model. The model may represent the physics of the situation perfectly and exactly in each and every relevant detail. But if that perfect  model is tuned to a dataset, even a perfect dataset, it may have no predictive capability at all.
The third unexpected result was the effect of error. The authors found that if there are even small modeling errors, it may not be possible to find any model with useful predictive capability.
To paraphrase, even if a tuned (“calibrated”) model is perfect about the physics, it may not have predictive capabilities. And if there is even a little error in the model, good luck finding anything useful.
This was a very clean experiment. There were only three tunable parameters. So it looks like John Von Neumann was right, you can fit an elephant with three parameters, and with four parameters, make him wiggle his trunk.
I leave it to the reader to consider what this means about the various climate models’ ability to simulate the future evolution of the climate, as they definitely are tuned or as the study authors call them “calibrated” models, and they definitely have more than three tunable parameters.
In this regard, a modest proposal. Could climate scientists please just stop predicting stuff for maybe say one year? In no other field of scientific endeavor is every finding surrounded by predictions that this “could” or “might” or “possibly” or “perhaps” will lead to something catastrophic in ten or thirty or a hundred years. Could I ask that for one short year, that climate scientists actually study the various climate phenomena, rather than try to forecast their future changes? We still are a long ways from understanding the climate, so could we just study the present and past climate, and leave the future alone for one year?
We have no practical reason to believe that the current crop of climate models have predictive capability. For example, none of them predicted the current 15-year or so hiatus in the warming. And as this paper shows, there is certainly no theoretical reason to think they have predictive capability.
The models, including climate models, can sometimes illustrate or provide useful information about climate. Could we use them for that for a while? Could we use them to try to understand the climate, rather than to predict the climate?
And 100 and 500 year forecasts? I don’t care if you do call them “scenarios” or whatever the current politically correct term is. Predicting anything 500 years out is a joke. Those, you could stop forever with no loss at all
I would think that after the unbroken string of totally incorrect prognostications from Paul Ehrlich and John Holdren and James Hansen and other failed serial doomcasters, the alarmists would welcome such a hiatus from having to dream up the newer, better future catastrophe. I mean, it must get tiring for them, seeing their predictions of Thermageddon™ blown out of the water by ugly reality, time after time, without interruption. I think they’d welcome a year where they could forget about tomorrow.
Regards to all,
w.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Karsten Brandt is one of Germany’s leading commercial meteorologists and runs www.donnerwetter.de/, which provides forecasting services in the private sector. He often appears as an expert in the German media, see here for example.
At his donnerwetter.de site he recently published an article, which I’ve translated in English with kind permission.
=================================================
Where’s the Climate Change?
By Dr. Karsten Brandt
www.donnerwetter.de/
Climate change – varying signals
Things are getting tense for the prophets of global warming, or better said: serious. This is because climate models are supposed to reproduce reality. For 25 years there have been “modern climate prognoses from ever more sophisticated calculations and every bigger computers”. In the meantime billions (and perhaps even a trillion) have been spent on climate science. The result: It’s going to get warmer quickly. By 2020 climate change will be especially detectable in the global temperature curve.
But the actual signals are in fact confusing. On one hand numerous temperature records are being broken at weather stations, and on the other hand various data are showing that the temperature trend has stagnated over the last 15 years.
A truly good explanation for this surprise does not exist. In 2007 Donnerwetter.de provided a number of contradictions surrounding the climate prognoses. For example, the danger of storms in Germany was supposed to increase, but nstead the danger of storms in Germany has been on the decline.
Here are our views on climate change from 2007, and they still hold today
After North Sea storm “Kyrill“ struck, one could read and hear everywhere that the weather has gone crazy and that climate change was causing more chaotic and dangerous weather in Germany. But repeating a claim over and over again does not make it correct. Donnerwetter.de Weather Services has therefore put many of the more popular claims to the test.
Fact: Climate is changing, the temperatures have been rising globally, and also in Germany this trend can be clearly seen. It’s also a fact that man has played a large role in this development and thus must continue making efforts to protect the environment. But it is also a fact that the horror scenarios produced for Germany are without any scientific merit:
Claim no. 1: Storms and cyclones are on the rise
———————————————————————-
The fact is that the number of storms and cyclones over the last few years have been very low from a historical standpoint. Around 1550 about 40 storms were observed each year; that number dropped to around 20 during the 18th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries the number ranged between 10 and 20. The last years have been really quiet. the number of storms dropped considerably, especially after 1995.
Thus claim no. 1 is false!
Claim no. 2: North Sea storm surges are on the rise
———————————————————————-
Statistics show that the number of storm surges at the German North Sea coast have dropped markedly. After a strong increase in storm surges during the 1940s, it can be observed that they are much less today.
That claim is false as well!
Claim no. 3: Climate change is causing more hurricanes
———————————————————————-
There are no statements concerning wind climate in the pertinent IPCC publications. In its own publication, re-insurer Munich Re determined that future development is very uncertain. But if the climate prognoses are correct, then westerlies should be weaker, and thus the probability of large storms even declines! Therefore it is incomprehensible how such claims could be made.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The claim is at the very least doubtful.
Claim no. 4; Bad weather (violent thunderstorms/tornadoes) are increasing in Germany
———————————————————————-
This is also a widespread belief. But it is not supported by any data. To the contrary: the number of days with storms and heavy rains has declined or remained constant at many weather stations since the mid 1990s. Especially in the summertime stormy winds occur only during thunderstorms. One example: in Aachen the number of storm days (wind strength more than 6) from 1990 to 2006 declined to only 2 days per month during this period (that’s 25% less!).
The claim is false!
Claim no. 5: Bad weather (violent thunderstorms/tornadoes) are increasing because of climate change
———————————————————————-
This is merely suspected in studies by climate scientists, but there is no proof. The data actually point to the contrary.
This claim is doubtful at best.
Claim no. 6: The weather is becoming more chaotic and the atmosphere is “more loaded with energy”
———————————————————————-
It’s claimed time and again that rising temperatures will lead to greater temperature differences, and therefore will mean higher energy and bad weather potential in the atmosphere. Indeed temperatures in the polar regions are rising faster than in the subtropical regions. But this would point to a decrease in temperature difference, and thus tend to quiet the atmosphere.
That claim is false!
Claim no. 7: The climate has become more variable. Temperatrure fluctuations are greater. You can no longer rely on anything.
———————————————————————-
In studying the temperature fluctuation range in Germany (standard deviation) since 1756, the exact opposite is true. In the 18th century the standard deviation for the annual mean temperature was 25% higher than today. It dropped steadily until 1920 to today’s level, and has been fluctuating at this level ever since. Thus the weather has not gotten more variable. It used to be much worse.
The claim is false!
—————————————————————
Before you think that the author is “naturally” pursuing personal “interests” as a climate skeptic and paid by CO2 polluters, please note that he is merely a small business director who runs a small limited liability company, and is thus perhaps more free to speak up than the representatives of the global climate circus, many of whom we know have made impressive careers and are living very well.
Be skeptical whenever anyone makes 100-year prognoses because no one is able to really forecast the climate. Already in the 1960s a number of climatologists failed with their 100-year forecasts and beyond (ice age prognoses). The climate system is far too complex to allow us to simply make regional forecasts for climate development.
At the Donnerwetter.de Wetterpark in der Eifel, climate change is a big issue. We would be pleased about your visit and a discussion with you.

We must stop pollution for reasons of biosphere toxicity, **NOT because of climate change.** The TSI model of solar forcing ignores nearly all climate forcing aspects of space weather AND applies that forcing to the human total. This video shows that fact in a way that anyone can understand.

Every year, as temperatures approach their July peak, our greener friends trot out global warming horrors and even more horrible policies—witness President Obama’s recently proposed diktats. But this year it’s different, as some conservatives are pushing a oxymoronic “revenue neutral” carbon tax.



You’d think people in D.C. might learn from others. Just last month, precisely such a tax took down Australia’s Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. She had succeeded Kevin Rudd, who was bounced out of office for his support of a cap‐​and‐​trade scheme. Rudd is now temporarily back, likely to be replaced when his Labour party pays the ultimate price for Gillard’s tax in September’s general election.





In Washington, bad ideas are never in short supply.



Washington’s version of political suicide is the brainchild of former Congressman Bob Inglis (R-SC), who lost his primary by a 70–29 margin when he got global warming religion. He now heads the “Energy and Enterprise Initiative” at R Street Partners, a relatively new Washington think tank which split off from Chicago’s libertarian/​conservative Heartland Institute over their aggressive stance on climate change.



Inglis’ theory—you can’t make this kind of stuff up—is that his tax is going to be magically adopted by Congress in some type of grand deal during President Obama’s last year. Ask yourself: when was the last time the opposition party made big deals with a lame duck Administration?



Every polemic I have seen on the carbon tax—including Inglis’—particularly and specifically ignores recent global warming science in complete contravention of a mountain of evidence now accruing that global warming was dramatically over forecast by scientists who had every incentive to do just that. Furthermore, with regard to “revenue neutrality,’ the notion that gazillions of dollars will float through Washington “unmolested” (h/​t to Heritage’s David Kreutzer for that zinger) is as foolhardy as ignoring what is happening in climate science.



Ignoring the science means disregarding 14 separate experiments published in the scientific literature in the last two years, all showing that way too much global warming was forecast. The fact that there isn’t any temperature trend whatsoever in the last 16 years is forcing scientists to confront the reality that the carbon taxers are choosing to evade.



The failure of the forecasts of dramatic warming is systematic. A presentation in late June at the American Geophysical Union’s Washington meeting on climate science and policy, titled “Policy Implications of Climate Models on the Verge of Failure,” demonstrated that, using the normative rules of science, the forecasts presuming big warming must now be abandoned.



One can use the EPA’s own model (curiously, acronymed MAGICC) to assess the effects on global temperature of emissions reductions that would be caused by a carbon tax. Assuming outrageously high taxes that would reduce them by 83% (giving Americans the per‐​capita emissions of 1867), the amount of warming that would be prevented is too small to measure on the 50‐​year time scale. Anything less does even less.



Irrationalities like conservatives supporting something that cannot happen (a revenue‐​neutral energy tax) don’t arise in a vacuum, which prompts some speculation as to who is supplying the massive amount of money needed to propagandize something that seems so absurd.



A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis, “Effects of a Carbon Tax on the Economy and the Environment” may include a clue. The report is pretty much boilerplate except for where it departs into a specific section on the implementation of the tax on coal producers:



 _“…analysts suggest that because the bulk of coal is used to generate electricity, emissions resulting from coal could be covered by taxing electricity generators on the basis of their actual emissions”._



Whose analysts?



Taxing coal at the point of electricity generation will be a decreasing expense to the industry (since EPA has pretty much outlawed any new coal‐​fired power plants), more than made up for by the bonanza of tax‐​free coal “leaking” from the highly‐​regulated U.S. to ports around the world.



Maybe this explains the sudden emergence of a bizarre carbon tax based on a completely irrational set of assumptions being aggressively pushed by an obscure think tank and a former congressman.



Or maybe it doesn’t. In Washington, bad ideas are never in short supply.

"With the promise that Tesla’s Model S will “liberate its owners from the petroleum-burning paradigm”, this electric car is an example of just how far technological innovation could take us towards achieving carbon emissions reduction targets and reducing consumption of fossil fuels.  The technology is certainly impressive but it is concerning to see innovation of this kind being held up as the holy grail of a more sustainable future – especially if it comes at the expense of pursuing other ways to solve the problem. One reason why the Model S has caused such excitement is its matching of conventional cars in performance, design and desirability. Many of the previous shortfalls of electric vehicles, such as acceleration, driving range and battery life have been addressed. The UK government’s target of “almost” every van and car being emission free by 2050 is starting to look more reasonable and the hype is alluring: technology has resolved the problem and life can carry on as normal.  It’s worth reminding ourselves that although the Model S produces zero emissions, electric cars use electricity and this has to be generated somehow. As a recent OECD report points out, electric cars displace their emissions to the energy generation sector, rather than remove them entirely. In this sense, zero emission vehicles would only arrive with an entirely de-carbonised electricity supply – which is hard to imagine. Even the Treasury’s 2008 King review of low carbon cars, whose key recommendations underpin UK electric vehicle policy, recognised the extent of progress that was required if low-carbon electricity generation was to meet the 80% carbon emissions reduction target.  In environmental terms, electric vehicles are an answer to the wrong question. For the past decade or so, national policy has framed the problem of private car use and the environment in increasingly narrow terms. In the early 1990s, sustainable transport policy was concerned with a broad set of issues. These included road congestion, the loss of countryside and the disturbance of rural and semi-rural areas due to road building or the reallocation of land for parking. Now the problem is debated only in terms of emissions targets. National policy in relation to all forms of transport is heavily focused on vehicle technology to the detriment of other possibilities. These policies actually reinforce current patterns of consumption, tying us to a future in which the use of private cars continues to dominate and increase. This is reflected in the substantial road building programme which comes part and parcel with low-emissions vehicle policy.  Rather than relying on ambitious technological development to provide sustainable transport in the future we might instead invest more in developing ways to challenge the car as the dominant means of getting around, and reducing the car dependence that permeates so many aspects of our everyday lives.  This is not uncharted territory, and there are several places we might turn for inspiration. One example from the mid-1990s is the government’s own planning guidance notes that were explicitly aimed at halting steadily increasing car use. The notes to local authority planners proposed various measures: requiring new developments to be accessible via a range of modes of transport, locating traffic-generating activities such as places of employment so they are highly accessible by public transport, and by making driving more difficult, for example from parking restrictions, limited parking bays and pedestrianisation of roads. But as guidance and not legislation, local authorities were left in an invidious position. If they applied the guidance then they risked  developers passing over them in favour of neighbouring areas. The alternative was to give the green light to projects that further embed car-use. And this kind of planning only creates the conditions for less car use; it doesn’t guarantee it – but at least the policy ambition was there. There is some potential for optimism when it comes to contemporary policy though. Some recent Department for Transport documents set out ambitious goals which break from the status quo. These include the Door-to-door strategy, which aims to encourage alternatives to private cars for trips of any length (not just those under five miles), and reducing the need to travel through telecommuting and flexible working.  Though less immediately measurable than a car that produces zero emissions, I’d suggest these ambitions for social change hold just as much promise as technology – and more. Our trust in techno-fix solutions, though misguided, illustrates that we have vision. Let’s use this to address some more relevant questions. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf Germany had recorded a record 5 warmer winters in a row, people would be reading and hearing about it for days without end. However, just the opposite has occurred: Germany has now experienced 5 colder than normal winters in a row – “a record” – now made official by the German Weather Service (This winter 0.6°C below 1981-2010 average). Yet, hardly a peep from the media on this.
But the media peeps are beginning!
At least one arm of the German mainstream media has reported this. In its Panorama section, German online daily Die Welt has an article about the recent trend, written by Ulli Kulke. The introduction reads:
Spring is just around the corner, at least from a meteorological point of view. However Germany is stuck in a record winter without sun and warmth.”
According to meteorologists, since daily sunshine measurements began in 1951, no DJF German winter has been so cloudy and dreary in Germany as this 2012/13 winter. Moreover the DJF mean temperature for the country was 0.6°C cooler than the 1981 – 2010 average. That makes it the fifth winter in a row this has occurred – a record.
Kulke quotes meteorologist Dominik Jung:
In this regard Jung says: ‘The earlier climate projections, i.e. the climate prognoses of the 1980s and 1990s, have, at least for Germany, more or less massively faltered over the last years.'”
The models have not only been wrong for the winters but also for the summers, Kulke writes, citing Jung on prognoses made for hotter and drier summers:
…of the last 10 summers only one was too dry, and that was the summer of 2003, […] otherwise all other summers were normal or too wet.”

What’s worse for the climate models the Met Office forecasts the cooler weather to continue at least through 2017, Kulke writes. Even IPCC chairman and ultra-warmist Rajendra Pachauri recently conceded the cool trend might last “30 or 40 years“.
Die Welt writes that the recent trend may provide “a tailwind in the climate discussion” for those who claim that “the impact of the sun on climate change over the last decades has been underestimated far too much, and that the role of CO2 exaggerated – which by and large has been supported by two new peer-reviewed studies in journals this year.”
Die Welt adds on the cosmic ray – cloud formation – cooling theory:

Theoretically this relationship has been known a long time. The parallelism between global temperature and solar activity over the past 1000 years appears to confirm it.”

Indeed the theory is so compelling that even CERN and the Danish National Space Center in Copenhagen are conducting large scale, extensive experiments and studies on it. Die Welt now appears to be opening up to a new climate theory:
“…the results could deliver new explosive material for the climate discussion.”
This truly marks a change in direction for Die Welt.
No matter what is claimed, one thing is certain: The climate discussion is now progressing ahead in Germany with the massive, unstoppable inertia of a glacier, grinding to a pulp every false claim in its path.
Observe how the mainstream German media is coming around and conceding the discussion is indeed far from over, acknowledging that the solar theory is real and gathering in strength, and that warming has unexpectedly stopped.

Good old _Stuff & Nonsense_ are beating the climate emergency drum as loud as they can. One has to wonder what financial inducements there are behind this _Stuff & Nonsense_ campaign for them to be so hard out on the climate crises and so low on facts and reality.



For example, a church being drowned by the rising sea levels. An emergency? A crisis? No. **Nothing to do with the climate whatsoever.**



When Mary Ann San Jose moved to Sitio Pariahan more than two decades ago, she could walk to the local chapel. Today, reaching it requires a swim. 



The main **culprit is catastrophic subsidence caused by groundwater being pumped out from below** , often via unregulated wells for homes, factories, and farms catering to a booming population and growing economy.



  
For this congregation, it is absolutely a crisis and it is absolutely man-made but it is **absolutely nothing to do with CO** **2** **.**



No wonder _Stuff_ will not allow comments on any climate ‘crisis’ article.

The controversial Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report _Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment_ stirred criticism that the DHS had turned away from monitoring real terrorism plots and was now labeling veterans, pro‐​life groups, and limited government advocates as threats to national security. Consider those fears vindicated.   
  
  
Americans for Limited Government (ALG) filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents and correspondence that supported the DHS report. The result: DHS sent a letter and list of the sources used to assess a significant number of innocent Americans as potential terrorists.   
  
  
Seriously, read the whole thing. This collection of open source material amounts to an afternoon of internet browsing. Several arrests and indictments are mentioned, but newspapers and blogs are used instead of primary documents such as _actual_ arrest reports and indictments that are available over the internet.   
  
  
When a government agency charged with the physical security of the nation’s borders is running around on the internet looking for accusations of racism instead of using actual law enforcement and intelligence reports to justify its threat assessments, we are all in trouble. As Jeffrey Rosen has said, the biggest problem with DHS is that it was “a bureaucratic and philosophical mistake.”   
  
  
Create a bureaucracy designed to inflate fears and issue color‐​coded threat levels, and that is what you will get. But don’t be surprised when TSA agents at the airport decide to go beyond their aviation security mission and get rebuked by a federal judge. Expect people lawfully traveling with cash to get detained without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion that they are breaking the law or pose a threat to airline safety. Anticipate that the “no‐​fly” list will become a “no‐​rights” list when a politician can seek political advantage by advocating that anyone designated for double‐​secret probation be denied their Second Amendment rights.

At first glance, prospects for economic liberalism in the UK appear gloomy, whatever tomorrow’s result.



Corbyn’s socialism speaks for itself. But the Conservatives’ slide away from liberal economics continues. Boris Johnson’s last Cabinet, on paper, arguably had the strongest “dry” economic credentials of any since the 19th century. Yet recent announcements for new protectionist state aid laws, “buy British” plans for public bodies, cancellation of corporation tax cuts, and the embrace of government spending as a proxy for public service quality, appear to provide evidence of an ongoing statist shift in the party’s mindset.



Many economic liberals feel despair towards both the Conservatives and Labour as a result. _The Economist_ election leader epitomised that reflex. Yes, it acknowledged, Corbyn’s socialism was beyond the pale. But so was Johnson, who’d “accelerated the shift from an economically and socially liberal party into an economically interventionist and culturally conservative one.” By erecting new trade barriers and ending free movement, Brexit is seen by many liberal commentators as anti‐​liberal by definition. A new more working‐​class Tory‐​voting coalition will inevitably change the Conservatives’ electoral offer away from free markets too, so conventional wisdom goes.



Should economic classical liberals despair? We certainly should be worried by today’s political currents. But if the polls are right, I think we should also be cautiously thankful for the stay of execution that Johnson’s leadership and manifesto have given us, using that reprieve for some self‐​reflection of our own strategy.



Despite claims to the contrary, leaving the EU is not “anti‐​liberal by definition.” Ask Remainers. One of their well‐​worn worries is that the UK outside the EU might become a Singapore‐​on‐​Thames — a low tax economy with light regulations and privatised healthcare. Brexit broadens the range of political possibilities, for good or ill, to include _Liberaltopia_. Whether a more economically liberal Britain arises depends on how we use those repatriated powers over decades. Brexit is for life, not just for Christmas.



Things could be much worse than Johnson in the near term too. Just six years ago, _The Economist_ heralded him as a great social and economic liberal. He’s been a long‐​time champion of immigration, anti‐​the nanny state, a trailblazer in the party for social liberties, and instinctively a low‐​tax Tory. Of course, he’s always had a penchant for big infrastructure projects and high minimum wages — he’s no libertarian. But it’s uncontroversial to believe he’s more liberal than his party, and more liberal than current public attitudes.



True, under his leadership, the party has pledged significant public spending increases. But these have been, by and large, highly targeted on frontline public services. To conflate the Conservative drift for higher spending on core government functions after years of restraint with a Labour party intent on delivering the biggest state in our history, confiscating company shares, and renationalising swathes of the economy, is false equivalence. Defeating Corbynism would be economic liberalism’s biggest defensive victory since 1979.



Recent Conservatives announcements on state aid and populist lines on migration are more disturbing. But given the broader climate of opinion, we free‐​marketeers might be grateful for small mercies. Johnson is not imbued with a desire to max out the “the good government can do” a la May. His liberal instincts (and those of many around him) are surely why the May tidal wave of new bans has receded and why the manifesto didn’t contain any misguided agenda to “reform capitalism.” Indeed, what we appear to be seeing from Johnson is not a government‐​loving “Borisism”, but a focus‐​group driven agenda — trying to win an election by addressing voter’s stated concerns. And doing so in a zeitgeist inhospitable to free market ideas.



Electoral politics doesn’t occur in a vacuum. Politics is the final act. We must therefore avoid concluding from timelines, instead judging Johnson against real counterfactuals. We are in a period where major reform of capitalism is a drumbeat through the pages of the _Financial Times_. Where Davos men suggest businesses move away from focus on profits. Where rapid decarbonisation, devoid of costs considerations, is taken seriously. Where business groups are unwilling or unable to defend the market economy, even with socialist barbarians at the gates.



Such an environment is the product of years of ceding bad arguments to capitalism’s critics, while failing to revise policies that centralise power and make people’s lives worse. Given prevailing conventional wisdom, the real surprise was that the manifesto was not more anti‐​market. When you see Donald Trump’s protectionist agenda, Corbyn’s manifesto, and the demands of new Tory think‐​tanks, Johnson is arguably offering the least possible change consistent with the feelings of the age.



Let’s put it another way: is there any other current Conservative MP who is more instinctively liberal than Boris who could have transformed the party’s electoral prospects over the past three months to be close to winning this election? Whatever tomorrow’s outcome, the answer is a bracing one for those who believe in economic freedom.



The hard truth we economic liberals must now face is that Britain is once again dominated by collectivist thinking. The Conservatives have been on a very, very slow drift away from market economics over a 25‐​year period. Thatcherism proved an interlude in terms of advancement of market‐​based policies. Subsequent years saw those gains defended, but in recent times a “drip, drip” of anti‐​market interventions and proposals has now become a flood of demands for new misguided interventions. Yes, Johnson has let some through. But there could have been many more with a different leader.



Whether or not a Conservative majority is secured tomorrow, the UK’s economic liberals need desperately to rethink strategy. First: time, energy, and resources need to be put into the institutions that seek to change the broader climate of opinion, rather than affect near‐​term politics. A naive view that many instinctively held — that with just the right Conservative leader and personnel, economic liberalism would flourish — is clearly misguided. A free‐​market Conservative party will only re‐​appear when there is electoral demand for one. The past four years are an early warning sign.



Second, we should be relieved by Boris’s priorities and his manifesto focusing on principles, which leaves opportunities for influence. Johnson has made clear his desire to raise productivity levels and economic growth. He wants to address living costs for poorer families. And he wants to raise investment — both public and private. Economically liberal policies have much to offer here. So after the election, the purer policy‐​oriented think‐​tanks should grasp the opportunity to devise sound economic policy ideas that fulfil such objectives, and work hard to show why other anti‐​market drifts are misguided.



Yuval Levin defines conservatism as “gratefulness.” We free‐​marketeers obviously dislike current anti‐​liberal machinations on all sides. But tomorrow we can hopefully be grateful for what we still have.

"It was hailed as a great victory for conservation, common sense and people power. Last year the European Commission finally voted to phase out the shameful practice of discarding hundreds of thousands of tonnes of perfectly good fish, either by-catch or target species caught over the allowable quota, as permitted by the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  Although hundreds of scientists, NGOs, politicians and legislators worked behind the scenes to make this happen, the issue really hit the public consciousness through the work of the mop-haired part-time celebrity chef/eco-warrior, Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall. His Fish Fight TV series exposed the images of tonnes of dead fish being dumped overboard to the public. In fact his campaign was so successful that over 870,000 people signed his petition to end discards, and he was granted personal meetings with Maria Damanaki, the European Fisheries Commissioner. So why are we now seeing headlines suggesting the discard ban could actually harm wildlife, and that Fish Fight’s campaign was misleading? Hugh was even given the Paxman treatment in a debate on Newsnight.  This renewed interest has been spurred by the publication of a paper in the journal Nature Communications by Professor Mike Heath and colleagues at the University of Strathclyde that examines the knock-on effects of a discard ban.  Using an ecosystem model of the North Sea, the paper’s authors examined the effect of two different management approaches. The first simulated the fishers’ obligation to land all catch (the discard ban), including undersize (ie, juvenile) or unwanted (ie, by-catch) fish, by inflating the landing quotas accordingly. The second simulated the same landing obligation, but added an element which added fishers efforts to be more selective and avoid unwanted catch by maintaining lower quotas. Not surprisingly, the first option had negative effects on marine ecosystems. Not only would it result in increased pressure on fish stocks – it removes more fish from the sea – but by removing the discards it would also remove a source of food scavenged upon by seabirds, marine mammals and seabed creatures. There might be some short-term economic benefits to fishers, but in the long term the catch rates are likely to be unsustainable, and the oceans in general will suffer. This is the story that has been seized upon by the media and some sections of the fishing industry, because it is the option being considered by the European Commission. Surely no one is suggesting that we go back to the bad old days and try to maintain a marine ecosystem that relies on us throwing away 30-40% of the fish we catch each year? In the North Sea alone, this is can account for hundreds of thousands of tonnes each year. And despite some counter-claims this week, this rate of discarding has remained relatively constant for several decades.    The second management scenario, which encourages more selective fishing, has to be the better way to go. That way catch rates are more sustainable, scientists gain better data on the fisheries, and the previously discarded material stays in the sea where it can be part of a more natural food chain. What evidence is there that the discard ban, or to be more politically correct, landing obligation, will work? Discard bans have been successfully implemented elsewhere in the world, including in the Alaskan and British Columbian groundfish trawl fisheries, and fisheries in New Zealand, Icelandic, Faroese and Norwegian waters.  A couple of years ago one of my MSc students, Ben Diamond, and I examined the effectiveness of the Norwegian discard ban and whether or not a similar policy should be introduced to the North Sea. Norway introduced a discard ban for cod and haddock in 1987, and has progressively applied it to more species since. Instead of increasing pressure on fish stocks, the discard ban, in combination with real-time closures of waters that contain high concentrations of juvenile fish, has encouraged fishermen to install fishing gear modifications that are more selective in the fish they catch.  As a result, improving data and understanding of fishing mortality has led to better management advice and more sensible fishing quotas. There were some short-term economic costs to the fishing industry, but today the Norwegian and Barents Sea fisheries are among the most prosperous in the world. It’s about time that a similar system is introduced in the North Sea, and in fact as widely as possible throughout European waters.  When the European Commission comes to decide on how to implement the CFP reform, we must hope it will ignore those lobbying for short-term interests, and instead take note of the long-term success of our northern neighbours."
"The Thwaites glacier is one of the most rapidly changing in Antarctica. It’s been the focus of considerable attention in recent weeks, after scientists suggested that this sector of the huge West Antarctic Ice Sheet was already on route towards collapse due to warming ocean temperatures. A major collapse of this part of the ice sheet could have dire consequences worldwide, with a global sea level rise of potentially up to 1m. Some models suggest this could take place comparatively rapidly, within a few centuries. But hidden beneath the kilometres of ice in this rapidly changing part of the continent is a largely unexplored geological feature: the West Antarctic Rift System, a strip of volcanic activity thought to extend for more than 3,000km across the Antarctic continent, provides further heat to melt the ice sheet from below. The rift is where the Earth’s crust has in the past been stretched, pushing magma near to the surface and causing widespread volcanic activity. It’s important to establish the amount of volcanic heat from the rift in order to more accurately predict the response of the Thwaites glacier and entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet to the effects of a warming climate and ocean.  Direct measurements of the geothermal heat flux from the rift are however difficult and expensive to obtain – the overlying ice sheet is in places 4km thick. Estimates of geothermal heat flux available so far are derived mainly from satellite magnetic data or seismology that struggle to resolve the regional details required to understand what effects the heat would have on the ice sheet.  In a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the US, researchers from the Institute for Geophysics at The University of Texas, Austin, report a new method of estimating the geothermal heat flux beneath Thwaites glacier. Using radar data to map how water flows under the ice sheet and estimate ice melting rates, they have identified significant sources of high geothermal heat. According to lead author Dustin Shroeder (who now works at NASA), these appear to be distributed over a much wider area than previously thought. The minimum average geothermal heat flow beneath Thwaites glacier is about 100 milliwatts per square metre, with some hotspots reaching 200 milliwatts per square metre. This is considerably higher than the average heat flow of the Earth’s continents, at less than 65 milliwatts per square metre.  Detecting such high geothermal heat flux within this part of West Antarctic Rift means that there is likely to be much more water beneath Thwaites glacier. The presence of water can lubricate and speed up the flow of glaciers, even in the deep interior of the ice sheet kilometres beneath the surface. Several models used to simulate the present ice sheet assume much lower geothermal heat for the region, or less variability in heat flow than what the study team has proposed. As Schoreder said, the combination of heat and water interacting with the glacier’s base could “threaten the stability of Thwaites glacier in ways that we never before imagined.” We need to carry out further geophysical research, with other methods, to validate the predictions of such high geothermal heat that the team has derived from radar data analysis alone. Magnetic and gravity methods have been used, for example, to study rifts and geothermal heat flux patterns in many regions worldwide, and could be applied here to obtain an independent perspective. We also need more data and further computer modelling to try to understand more fully what impact this high geothermal heat has on the flow of water underneath glaciers, how this affects ice sheet dynamics, and ultimately how this will further our understanding of how Antarctica is responding to a warming world. This remarkable study is focused on the variability of geothermal heat beneath the Thwaites glacier that may have a bearing on ice dynamics in this vulnerable part of Antarctica. The level of heat in the rift system inferred from radar probe data doesn’t imply that ocean warming driven by global warming is not a significant contributor to the ice loss seen in this part of West Antarctica.  This study does not address ice sheet stability directly at all – it neither supports nor refutes the recent studies’ conclusions that the Thwaites glacier is already on route to collapse. But better understanding of how geothermal heat affects the flow of water underneath glaciers will allow us to develop improved models to better predict ice sheet behaviour, and ultimately how Antarctica is responding to a warming world."

Chris Horner of the American Tradition Institute writes in with this:
So the American Association for the Advancement of Science, thoroughly rattled by the American Tradition Institute’s FOIA requests of UVa and NASA — and even more so by the litigation forced by the institutions’ respective stonewalling — issued a board statement comparing FOIA requests of climate scientists with death threats.  Really.
Naturally this caught the eye of the New York Times, which had a young lady contact us for comment. Right off the bat it was clear she, too, had been rattled by the horrors of our outrageous efforts to …see certain records the taxpayer has paid for and which are expressly covered by transparency laws.
Her stance was sympathetic to AAS’s to the point of temper.
She first reaffirmed a fancy for the apparently absolute truth that a FOIA request for climate scientists’ records is indeed no different than death threats allegedly made in Australia against scientists — sadly, if that’s true, they are now treated to what ‘skeptics’ have experienced for years, as I have detailed.
Well, actually, her disinterest in Greenpeace having created this little cottage practice indicated that this is true only for certain climate scientists’ records. Not the ones whose records Greenpeace is asking her for…that’s just transparency, good-government type stuff.
She continued by wondering, as such, do we condone death threats (really?) and, if not, why would we then also issue a FOIA?
Why that is particularly amusing, as opposed to sad, is that she was shocked by my assertion that Big Science/Big Academia’s objection to having laws that obviously cover their own actually applied to their own was of a part with Hollywood objecting to laws being applied to Roman Polanski. Apparently, by saying this, I was accusing Michael Mann of some heinous crime. Or something.
So see the below as I sent to her and, given the above, I expect you will not see in the story. Surely because it will be too busy explaining the tyranny of Greenpeace broadly filing similar requests. ATI’s statement is here.

Subject: AAAS release citing ATI transparency efforts
Dear Joanna,
I’m told you called ATI for comment. Below is my response per an earlier inquiry.
Best,
Christopher C. Horner Senior Fellow Competitive Enterprise Institute 1899 L St, NW 12th Floor Washington, DC, 20036 +1.202.331.2260 (O)
…
Several points:
I noticed no relation between our initiative and the Board’s rhetoric until they mentioned us somewhat incongruously.
The notion that application of laws expressly covering academics [is] an ‘attack’ on academics is substantively identical to Hollywood apologists calling application of other laws to Roman Polanski an attack on Polanski. They rather lost the plot somewhere along the way.
The failure to mention the group that invented this series of requests, Greenpeace, informs a conclusion that this attempt at outrage is selective, and therefore either feigned or hypocritical. This is also new; their problem is quite plainly with the law(s), but it is a problem they have, over the decades of transparency and ethics laws applying to scientists subsisting on taxpayer revenue, heretofore forgotten to mention.
Opposition to such laws applying to them is rather shocking. But then, maybe not so much when you also note their failure to comment on scientists being outed as advocating the flaunting of transparency laws.
Finally, AAUP’s code of professional ethics indicates that efforts to manipulate the peer review process are impermissible. Given the overlap and for other reasons we assume this is something AAAS agrees with or at minimum accepts. But this, too, is insincere if such behavior is permissible — or at least, where just cause indicates further inquiry is warranted, it is to be ignored — if the party at issue is one who for various reasons the AAAS or AAUP et al. elevate or find sympathetic. In Mann’s case, if our review of his documents which belong to the taxpayer also happen to exonerate him from the suspicions that have arisen, we will be the first to do so.

======================================================================
Today the board of directors for the American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a statement and press release that denounced “personal attacks,” “harassment,” “death threats,” and “legal challenges” toward climate scientists. AAAS’s press release specifically cited actions taken by American Tradition Institute’s Environmental Law Center in its efforts to obtain records of Climategate scientist Dr. Michael Mann from the University of Virginia, and its efforts to obtain outside employment records of climate activist Dr. James Hansen from the National Aeronautical and Space Administration(NASA).
AAAS wrote, in part,
“we are concerned that establishing a practice of aggressive inquiry into the professional histories of scientists whose findings may bear on policy in ways that some find unpalatable could well have a chilling effect on the willingness of scientists to conduct research that intersects with policy-relevant scientific questions.”
Response to AAAS from ATI Environmental Law Center director of litigation Christopher Horner:
“I noticed no relation between our initiative and the AAAS Board’s rhetoric until they mentioned us somewhat incongruously.

“The notion that application of laws that expressly cover academics is an ‘attack’ on them is substantively identical to Hollywood apologists who call application of other laws to Roman Polanski an attack on Polanski. They lost the plot somewhere along the way.
“AAAS’s failure to mention the group that invented this series of requests, Greenpeace, informs our conclusion that this outrage is selective, and is therefore either feigned or hypocritical. Their problem is plainly with the laws, but it is a problem they have had over the decades: That transparency and ethics laws also apply to scientists who subsist on taxpayer revenue. This they also forgot to mention.
“Finally, the American Association of University Professors’ code of professional ethics indicates that efforts to manipulate the peer review process are impermissible. Given the overlap, and for other reasons, we assume AAAS agrees with these principles or at a minimum accepts them. But this, too, is insincere if such behavior is permitted or ignored where just cause indicates further inquiry is warranted, as long as the parties at issue are those whose views the AAAS or AAUP sympathize with. In Mann’s case, if our review of his documents which belong to the taxpayer also happen to exonerate him from the suspicions that have arisen, we will be the first to do so.”

================================================================
Reaction is now coming in. Alana Goodman of Commentray Magazine writes in a piece titled
Contentions – Climate Change Skepticism Now Considered ‘Harassment’?
…
Of course, what the AAAS calls “personal information” actually appears to be public data. The group’s statement comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed against NASA by the conservative American Traditional Institute earlier this month, which is trying to force the agency to release information about scientist James Hansen.
And after years of watching climate change advocates demonizing global warming skeptics, it’s hard to have any sympathy for the AAAS on this issue. Not to mention, previously leaked emails have shown climate change scientists behaving in ways abusive to the public trust. Skeptics should absolutely work to expose any potential corruption in the global warming advocacy community — and the fact AAAS is so terrified of legal challenges is good reason to believe these skeptics might be onto something.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMDR television and radio here report of another solar energy catastrophe in Germany. Hat tip: Holger Thuss via Facebook.
It was a high tech center opened amid much media fanfare and ceremony back in April 2010, as the video below shows.

Fanfare and ceremony surrounded the opening of the now bankrupt “Center For Excellence” back in April 2010.
Numerous leading politicians, including national Research Minister Annette Schavan, were in attendance, and they all praised the “Center for Training and Excellence in the High Tech and Solar Industries” in Erfurt.
At the time, it was one of the latest prestige objects symbolizing the country’s ambition to become a global leader, and thus an example to the world, in renewable energy and environmental responsibility.
The facility was built at a cost of 10 million euros, 8 million of which came from the taxpayers. Today it stands bankrupt and empty. Insolvency liquidator Romy Metzger told German public television:
I no longer expect the assets will find a user for the way it was used formerly.”

German television adds that the building and inventory most likely will be separated. It simple laugauge: the project flopped. And now, according to MDR, an auction of the assets is no longer being ruled out. No interested investor could be found for the object as it was earlier.
The “center for excellence” included laboratories and clean rooms. Originally it was supposed to educate 2500 people every year for Germany’s planned mighty solar industry.
But over the last two years, almost every single one of Germany’s solar module and equipment manufacturers, most heavily subsidised by taxpayers, has closed in a wave of insolvencies not seen since East German industry collapsed in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It’s deja vu.
Germany’s entire solar industry has been transformed into a vast wasteland of false hopes and dashed dreams. MDR writes:
Demand never materialized and the solar expertise centre declared insolvency in June 2011.”

Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_ , proponents of stricter campaign finance regulation have increasingly prescribed “disclosure” as an antidote to “dark money” in politics. Advocates of more extensive donor disclosure laws typically invoke Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’s famous maxim that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants,” but they seldom acknowledge the harm of excessive sunlight.



This paper urges a more critical and balanced look at the issue, especially concerning disclosure requirements for independent political speech (i.e., speech that is not coordinated with candidates). Of primary focus is the Court’s jurisprudence in this area, which is often invoked to support additional compulsory donor disclosure laws but lacks coherence, especially as it applies to independent speech. Even assuming that the Court’s jurisprudence in this area remains sound, many arguments being advanced for compulsory donor disclosure laws are untethered from the justifications the Court has articulated, rendering them especially susceptible to challenge in litigation. This paper concludes with recommendations on how, and how not, to enact disclosure laws.



Specifically, disclosure laws should be changed to make sure they allow citizens to keep tabs on public officials rather than enable officials to oversee citizens. Current disclosure thresholds should be raised significantly. Disclosure requirements for independent speech should be limited significantly, given that such mandates do not serve traditional justifications for disclosure.



Paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr.’s immortal words, federal appellate court judge Janice Rogers Brown recently observed that “[t]he arc of campaign finance law has been ambivalent, bending toward speech and disclosure.” But these two values, she noted, “exist in unmistakable tension” with each other. 1 This paper will closely examine this tension between speech and disclosure in the context of compulsory donor disclosure requirements that apply to groups engaged in independent political speech activities. 2



Proponents of more disclosure requirements claim that such laws prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, while providing the electorate with useful information about candidates and elected officials. Critics, meanwhile, maintain that such laws chill speech that provides equally important information to voters and infringe on the right to anonymous speech and associational privacy.



Laws requiring candidates, political parties, political action committees (commonly known as PACs), and other sponsors of political speech to publicly disclose their spending and donors have existed for decades 3 and even predate the modern‐​era regulatory scheme. 4 The drumbeat for more disclosure seems to have increased in recent years, however, as the Supreme Court has increasingly circumscribed the other ways in which political speech may be regulated. Beginning with the seminal 1976 _Buckley v. Valeo_ case, running through the landmark _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_ case in 2010, and continuing thereafter in the 2014 _McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission_ decision, the Court has invalidated key campaign finance provisions that restrict spending on and contributions to political campaigns. However, the Court generally has upheld disclosure requirements in some form. Thus, the regulatory fight naturally has narrowed to focus on disclosure.



Congressional opponents of _Citizens United_ wasted no time after the decision was issued to introduce a disclosure bill dubbed, with characteristic Washington kitsch, the “DISCLOSE Act” (Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act). 5 Having failed to pass it initially in the 111th Congress, its supporters have introduced variants of the bill in each of the four successive Congresses. 6 In the current Congress, a new disclosure bill also has been introduced called the “SUN Act” (Sunlight for Unaccountable Nonprofits Act), 7 which appears to have no better prospects at passage than its legislative cousin.



Seeing its legislative attempts at disclosure thwarted repeatedly in Congress, the campaign finance “reform” lobby also has turned to the White House and administrative state. It urged, to no avail, the Obama Administration to implement an executive order that requires government contractors to disclose their political contributions. 8 It also sent political spending disclosure rulemaking petitions to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 the Securities and Exchange Commission, 10 and Federal Election Commission (FEC), again to no avail. 11 At the state level, countless bills to counteract so‐​called dark money have been introduced. 12



A wealth of resources already details the long‐​standing tradition and value of anonymous speech in this country, 13 and one need only pay attention to the news to recognize the continuing relevance and importance of anonymous speech in society today. 14 Likewise, abundant literature documents the many harmful social consequences and instances of retribution against donors wrought by compulsory campaign finance disclosure law. 15 I can’t add much to the existing work on these respects.



Rather, this paper will draw on my perspective as a campaign finance attorney who regularly advises clients on federal and state campaign finance disclosure laws. Like many other practitioners, jurists, and scholars who have grappled with this issue, my experience has led me to conclude that the Court’s rulings protecting anonymous speech and First Amendment associational privacy rights on the one hand, and compulsory donor disclosure laws on the other, are impossible to reconcile when applied to organizations operating independently of candidates. The jurisprudence in this area has failed to convincingly demonstrate that the purported societal interest in disclosure outweighs donors’ and speakers’ speech and privacy interests, and the justifications for disclosure also rest on questionable assumptions. What’s more, even if we assume for argument’s sake that the Court’s jurisprudence in this area is sound, many arguments being advanced for disclosure laws have no jurisprudential support and may wither under the light of scrutiny.



“Disclosure” is a term with warm and fuzzy connotations. When someone intersperses a “full disclosure” disclaimer in a conversation, we tend to credit the speaker for his or her candor. But privacy also is commonly regarded as a virtue in its own right. The right to privacy is held to be “fundamental” against intrusions by the government, 16 and laws also have proliferated over the years to protect our medical, 17 educational, 18 financial, 19 and online 20 privacy against intrusions by private actors.



These competing interests of privacy and anonymity versus disclosure in the context of political speech are reflected in the Court’s tortured and tortuous jurisprudence.



Jurisprudential Justifications for Donor Privacy. Although the notion of a right to associational privacy certainly preexisted the civil rights movement, the 1958 Supreme Court case _NAACP v. Alabama_ is as good a starting point as any for illustrating the compelling rationale for donor privacy. 21 In that case, state officials seeking to block the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from operating in Alabama subpoenaed the names and addresses of the group’s members in the state. 22 Although the case did not primarily revolve around the group’s donor list, 23 the Court later would apply the _NAACP_ holding specifically in the context of campaign finance donor disclosure laws. 24



In blocking Alabama’s subpoena of the NAACP’s membership list, the Court noted that “[e]ffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association” under the First Amendment, and “compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may constitute … a restraint on freedom of association.” 25 “[P]rivacy in group association,” the Court reasoned, “may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.” 26 Moreover, this constitutional protection of associational privacy does not diminish when the resulting reprisals come from “private community pressures” rather than government (though such reprisals often do come from government), “for it is only after the initial exertion of state power [in forcing disclosure] that private action takes hold.” 27



In 1960, in a case involving handbills urging a civil rights boycott, the Court struck down a Los Angeles city ordinance that required such materials to contain a disclaimer disclosing the names of their printers and those “who caused the same to be distributed”—including the identities of “owners, managers, or agents” in the case of organizational sponsors. 28 The Court stated plainly that “[t]here can be no doubt that such an identification requirement would tend to restrict freedom to distribute information and thereby freedom of expression.” 29 The Court recognized that “[p]ersecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all,” and that speaker “identification [requirements] and fear of reprisal might deter perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance.” 30



During the post‐​Watergate era, the Court began subordinating its strong protection for anonymous speech to the government’s purported interest in the disclosure of political spending. Nonetheless, in the seminal 1976 case _Buckley v. Valeo_ , which upheld the constitutionality of certain aspects of the post‐​Watergate campaign finance disclosure scheme, the Court continued to maintain that “compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment.” 31 Specifically addressing the issue of donor disclosure, the Court noted the following:



The right to join together for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is diluted if it does not include the right to pool money through contributions, for funds are often essential if advocacy is to be truly or optimally effective. Moreover, the invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when the information sought concerns the giving and spending of money as when it concerns the joining of organizations, for financial transactions can reveal much about a person’s activities, associations, and beliefs. 32



The Court further acknowledged that disclosure “will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute. In some instances, disclosure may even expose contributors to harassment or retaliation. These are not insignificant burdens on individual rights… .” 33 In light of these concerns, _Buckley_ “narrowly limited” the disclosure requirements at issue in the case to apply only to “organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate,” as well as “spending that is unambiguously campaign related.” 34



Even after _Buckley_ upheld the principle that _some_ campaign finance disclosure laws could be constitutional, the right to anonymous political speech maintained an important place in the Court’s jurisprudence. In the 1995 case _McIntyre v. Ohio Elections_ Commission, the Court again addressed whether “the First Amendment’s protection of anonymity encompasses documents intended to influence the electoral process.” 35 Specifically, the case arose out of a concerned citizen’s printing, financing, and distribution of flyers opposing a local school tax referendum. Some of those flyers did not comply with an Ohio law requiring disclaimers identifying the sponsor of any materials “designed to promote the nomination or election or defeat of a candidate, or to influence the voters in any election, or [to] make an expenditure for the purpose of financing political communications.” 36



In holding the Ohio law unconstitutional, the Court noted that “an author’s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.” 37 In addition to protecting against the “threat of persecution, an advocate may believe her ideas will be more persuasive if her readers are unaware of her identity. Anonymity thereby provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent. Thus, even in the field of political rhetoric … the most effective advocates have sometimes opted for anonymity.” 38 The Court compared anonymous political speech to “the secret ballot, the hard‐​won right to vote one’s conscience without fear of retaliation.” 39



Jurisprudential Justifications for Compulsory Donor Disclosure. Even as the Supreme Court’s _Buckley_ decision acknowledged the right to associational and donor privacy, the decision nonetheless found that “there are governmental interests [in disclosure] sufficiently important to outweigh” this right:



First, disclosure provides the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek federal office. It allows voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches. The sources of a candidate’s financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.  
  
Second, disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity. This exposure may discourage those who would use money for improper purposes either before or after the election. A public armed with information about a candidate’s most generous supporters is better able to detect any post‐​election special favors that may be given in return. 40



For sponsors of independent expenditures—that is, political advertising expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates that is not coordinated with any candidates—the Court acknowledged that “[t]he corruption potential of these expenditures may be significantly different.” 41 Thus, “if the only purpose of [independent spending disclosure requirements] were to stem corruption or its appearance,” such a justification “might have been fatal” to the law’s constitutionality. 42 Nonetheless, the Court held that the “informational interest” in disclosure was sufficient justification, because “disclosure helps voters to define more of the candidates’ constituencies.” 43



In short, after interpreting the law to cut back the scope of disclosure, the Court in _Buckley_ found that the remaining disclosure requirements contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act survived the “exacting scrutiny” standard for judicial review of disclosure laws, which are presumed to impose “significant encroachments on First Amendment rights.” 44 Under this balancing of interests, there must be a “substantial relation between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.” 45



The Court has continued to rely on Buckley’s framework and justifications in subsequent cases involving challenges to campaign finance disclosure laws. In McConnell _v. Federal Election Commission_ , the Court upheld the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act’s (BCRA) requirement that sponsors of so-called “electioneering communications” identify themselves in disclaimers and disclose their spending and information about certain donors on campaign finance reports. “[T]he important state interests that prompted the _Buckley_ Court to uphold [the Federal Election Campaign Act’s] disclosure requirements—providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding any appearance thereof, and gathering the data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions—apply in full to BCRA,” the Court held. 46



In _Citizens United_ , a plurality of the Court rebuffed a request by the eponymous group to exempt its commercial advertisements, which had urged viewers in 2008 to watch its documentary on then-candidate Hillary Clinton, from BCRA’s electioneering communication disclaimer and disclosure requirements. 47 “Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election. Because the informational interest alone is sufficient to justify application of [BCRA’s disclosure requirements] to these ads, it is not necessary to consider the Government’s other asserted interests,” the plurality opinion held. 48



Cracks in the Disclosure Jurisprudence. Proponents of expanding donor disclosure requirements for groups engaged in independent political speech rely on the Supreme Court’s disclosure rulings to validate their position. For example, even though Democracy 21 president Fred Wertheimer has lambasted _Citizens United_ as “one of the worst and most damaging decisions in the court’s history,” 49 he has lauded the decision for “affirm[ing] more than three decades of prior Court decisions in making clear that disclosure of money spent ... for campaign-related expenditures is constitutional.” 50 Former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel has called for “the mistaken jurisprudence of _Citizens United_ [to be] reexamined,” 51 even as she has praised the decision’s “rul[ing] that unlimited corporate independent political spending must be accompanied by transparency as to the sources of such spending.” 52



The Court’s disclosure jurisprudence is hardly a model of coherence, however, and proponents of disclosure should be wary of putting too much stock in it. Setting aside the doctrinal inconsistencies, there is also reason to question some of the Court’s assumptions about the purported governmental interests in disclosure.



As Judge Janice Rogers Brown has noted, “Both an individual’s right to speak anonymously and the public’s interest in contribution disclosures are now firmly entrenched in the Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence. And yet they are also fiercely antagonistic.” 53 Even more problematic is how the jurisprudence “treats speech, a constitutional right, and transparency, an extra-constitutional value, as equivalents.” 54 This latter point warrants some additional examination.



First, recall that it is not enough under the Court’s jurisprudence merely for the government to have a legitimate interest in requiring disclosure of political spending. Rather, the interest must be “sufficiently important to _outweigh_ ” the constitutional right to anonymous speech. 55



The disclosure debate today primarily revolves around requiring the reporting of funding sources for speech that is made independently of any candidates and political parties 56 (and, in some cases, speech that is not even related to any political campaigns). 57 For such independent speech, the only justification for disclosure the Court has articulated that remains viable and relevant is the “informational interest” in enabling the public to know who is funding political speech. 58 The anti-corruption rationale for disclosure mentioned in the _McConnell_ decision 59 no longer applies as a matter of law, as _Citizens United_ held that independent speech “do[es] not lead to, or create the appearance of, _quid pro quo_ corruption”—which is the only type of corruption relevant here. 60 Indeed, as noted previously, the informational interest is the only interest _Citizens United_ addressed in upholding disclosure requirements for independent speech, 61 and even the 1976 _Buckley_ decision suggested this was the primary justification for this type of disclosure requirement. 62



Admittedly, that anonymity and associational privacy in the exercise of speech have been held to be a constitutional right, while disclosure is merely an “extra-constitutional value,” does not automatically weigh in favor of the former. It is generally accepted that “First Amendment rights are not absolute under all circumstances. They may be circumscribed when necessary to further a sufficiently strong public interest.” 63 Nonetheless, it is difficult to conclude definitively that the informational interests the Court has endorsed for compulsory donor disclosure concerning independent political speech are “sufficiently important to _outweigh_ ” (in the formulation of _Buckley_ ) the reasons the Court has articulated for protecting the right to anonymous speech and associational privacy under the First Amendment. This is best illustrated simply by presenting these justifications side by side (see box on page 7).64



Even construing these arguments in the light most favorable to disclosure’s proponents, it is difficult to say objectively or conclusively that the justifications for compulsory disclosure outweigh the justifications for donor privacy and anonymous speech. As Judge Janice Rogers Brown put it, these competing interests appear, at best, to be “equivalent.” 65 Per the balancing test _Buckley_ articulated (although not as Buckley applied it), this should not be a sufficient basis to infringe on First Amendment rights, particularly where the “core political speech” that is being burdened falls squarely within “an area in which the importance of First Amendment protections is at its zenith.” 66 As federal appellate judge Frank Easterbrook has noted, rather than engaging in a serious application of the “Constitution to constrain contemporary legislation supported by the social class from which judges are drawn,” the Court’s jurisprudence in this area is tantamount to acting as a “council of revision” in “say[ing] that a law is valid to the extent that it is good ... [a]nd when, as in _McConnell_ , the judgment is supported by a one-vote margin, any Justice’s conclusion that a particular extension is unwise will reverse the constitutional outcome.” 67



Justifications for anonymous speech/associational privacy



Justifications for disclosure of sources of independent political speech



Not only is the Court’s general balancing of the competing interests in favor of disclosure questionable, but the specific reasoning and results of its decisions upholding disclosure also are difficult to reconcile with its decisions coming down on the side of anonymity. Of the _McConnell_ decision, Judge Easterbrook has noted “the Justices’ failure to discuss _McIntyre_ , or even to cite _Talley_ ” and other decisions protecting anonymous speech. 68 The Buckley, _McConnell_ , and _Citizens United_ decisions in favor of compulsory disclosure are particularly difficult to reconcile with the _McIntyre_ decision in favor of anonymous speech, as well as with other notable decisions, such as _Bates v. Little Rock_ 69 and _Pollard v. Roberts_ , 70 upholding the right to donor and associational privacy.



Attempts to distinguish the holding of _McIntyre_ (including within the _McIntyre_ decision itself) from other precedents upholding compulsory donor disclosure laws also are unpersuasive. First, _McIntyre_ attempts to draw a distinction between the disclosure related to speech about ballot measures at issue in that case and the disclosure related to speech about candidates at issue in _Buckley_. Although “avoiding the appearance of corruption” justifies disclosure of campaign spending on candidates, the _McIntyre_ decision explained that this concern is irrelevant to ballot measures because ballot measures cannot be corrupted. 71



However, as discussed previously, the anti-corruption rationale is not a relevant basis for distinguishing between disclosure requirements for candidate-related speech and ballot measure–related speech because this rationale—according to _Buckley_ and Citizens _United_ —is insufficient to uphold disclosure requirements for independent speech generally. 72



At the same time, _Buckley_ also upheld disclosure on the basis of its informational or heuristic value—that is, “allow[ing] voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely.” 73 That same rationale is used to justify requiring disclosure of the identities of speakers about ballot measures and their sources of funding. For example, former FEC commissioner Ann Ravel, who was also a former member of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, has explained that California requires disclosure of donors to groups advocating for or against ballot measures “so that voters can make informed choices at the ballot box.” 74



The _McIntyre_ decision flatly rejected this informational interest for being insufficiently important, however, and it did so in a way that was not limited to speech about ballot measures. Specifically, _McIntyre_ held that “the simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit.” 75 If requiring “additional relevant information” about speakers is insufficient to justify compulsory disclosure in the context of speech about ballot measures, then logically it should also be insufficient to justify compulsory disclosure in the context of independent speech about candidates. And yet the latter was upheld in _Buckley_ , McConnell, and _Citizens United_. 76



The _McIntyre_ decision also attempted to limit its holding by drawing a distinction between the sponsorship identification disclaimer requirement specifically at issue in that case and the financial reporting requirements at issue in other campaign finance disclosure cases. 77 Lower courts attempting to grapple with _McIntyre_ also have pointed to this distinction. 78 According to _McIntyre_ , financial reporting requirements are less objectionable because “even though money may ‘talk,’ its speech is less specific, less personal, and less provocative than a handbill—and as a result, when money supports an unpopular viewpoint it is less likely to precipitate retaliation.” 79 On the other hand, “A written election-related document—particularly a leaflet—is often a personally crafted statement of a political viewpoint... . As such, identification of the author [in a disclaimer requirement] against her will is particularly intrusive; it reveals unmistakably the content of her thoughts on a controversial issue.” 80



This attempt to limit _McIntyre’_ s holding also is unavailing. In my extensive experience advising clients on campaign finance disclaimer and donor reporting requirements, no organization that engages in political speech would ever regard a sponsorship identification disclaimer requirement as being more intrusive or burdensome than a requirement to report the organization’s donors. It is also not true, as _McIntyre_ claimed, that disclosure of donor information is “less likely to precipitate retaliation.” In practice, opponents of organizations’ political positions typically retaliate against the organizations’ publicly disclosed donors with as much (or greater) zeal as they do against the organizations themselves. 81 Moreover, this risk of retaliation against donors has only increased since _McIntyre_ was decided in 1995, as the Internet has greatly facilitated retrieving disclosure reports and donors’ personal information. 82



And even if the _McIntyre_ ruling is read narrowly to apply only to the enforcement of disclaimer requirements against _individuals_ , 83 the rationale it articulated for the right to privacy when exercising the right to free speech should apply no less to compulsory donor disclosure requirements for _groups_ of individuals. To wit, if an individual speaker has a right to choose whether she wishes to be publicly associated with “provocative” or “controversial” speech that is “likely to precipitate retaliation,” that right also should apply to individuals who choose to speak collectively through an association. Indeed, as discussed previously, the _Buckley_ decision articulated concern about the burdens on “individual rights” imposed by laws requiring disclosure of their contributions to organizations. 84



To the extent anyone may suggest that the disclaimer requirements at issue in _McIntyre_ are not “disclosure” requirements at all, 85 such a position also is untenable. The Supreme Court has described disclaimer requirements as part of a “disclosure regime,” 86 and advocates of compulsory disclosure laws agree. 87



The assumptions baked into the Court’s disclosure jurisprudence are at least as tenuous as its internal logic, or lack thereof. The “informational interest” theory the Court has endorsed rests on two basic interrelated premises: (1) that information about the sources of financial support for candidates or ballot measures is generally salient to voters, and (2) that voters will be able to draw a meaningful connection between that information and the candidates or issues they are voting on. Empirical research and real-world experiences call both premises into question.



It is important to note at the outset the apparent paucity of empirical data showing that voters use donor disclosure information to inform their votes. Writing in 2007, Professor Ray La Raja of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst noted, “There have been no empirical studies ... about the effect of disclosure on important political outcomes such as voter knowledge and trust. Indeed, we have a weak understanding about the mechanism through which voters learn about money in politics.” 88 Ten years later, that still appears to be the case, and what little research there is undercuts the case for disclosure.



This lack of evidence for compulsory disclosure should be fatal under the “exacting scrutiny” standard of judicial review held to apply to disclosure laws, under which the government typically is required to justify any impositions it places on speech. 89 Relatedly, in other campaign finance law contexts, the Court has warned that it has “never accepted mere conjecture [in defense of a speech restriction] as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden.” 90 However, as discussed previously, when it comes to campaign finance _disclosure_ laws, the Court tends to put its thumb on the scales in favor of compulsory disclosure—including its acceptance of the conjectural “informational interest” to justify such laws.



As the Court noted in _McIntyre_ , “in the case of a handbill written by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient, the name and address of the author add little, if anything, to the reader’s ability to evaluate the document’s message.” 91 This point is likely true of disclosure of campaign donor information generally: although certain donors may be recognizable to a small minority of the public (including a subset that is prone to using disclosure information to harass and retaliate against donors), for most Americans, disclosure information is probably meaningless.



For example, a 2014 poll found that more than half of Americans didn’t know who the Koch brothers were, 92 even though Charles and David Koch have been two of the country’s best-known political donors for at least the past decade or two. And this poll was taken _after_ Democratic Party leaders had undertaken a highly public and concerted effort to demonize the Koch brothers for their political giving and to hold them up as foils to the Democrats’ agenda. 93 Other relatively prominent donors across the political spectrum, such as George Soros, Tom Steyer, or Sheldon Adelson, likely enjoy comparable obscurity among the general public. If the donors disclosed under campaign finance laws are unknown to most of the public, this certainly calls into question the heuristic value or “informational interest” these laws are purported to advance.



Not only do average voters seem not to know who most political donors are, but they also don’t seem to care, even when this information is filtered through the news media, and notwithstanding the purported strong public support for disclosure laws in the abstract. 94 In 2011, Professor David Primo of the University of Rochester presented Florida voters with a hypothetical ballot measure based on an actual Colorado ballot measure, as well as 15 sources of information about the ballot measure comprising newspaper articles and editorials, a voter guide, and campaign ads. The study found that the two newspaper articles containing campaign finance disclosure information related to the ballot measure were the least viewed, and of those two articles, the one whose headline clearly indicated a story about campaign finance information drew the least interest. 95 On this basis, Primo concluded that “campaign finance information, in particular, is not of much interest to respondents.” 96



Moreover, the voters who chose to read the articles containing campaign finance disclosure information also read three times more articles in total than those who ignored the campaign finance articles. 97 Primo interpreted this as “suggesting that voters who access campaign finance information are the least likely to need it to make informed choices.” 98 Put another way, this finding corroborates Judge Easterbrook’s observation (discussed earlier) that the campaign finance disclosure jurisprudence reflects a bias of the “social class from which judges are drawn.” 99 To wit, those who are the most informed about political issues are the ones who find campaign finance disclosure information to be the most meaningful, while most Americans appear to be indifferent to such information.



Primo’s study is consistent with La Raja’s earlier study, in which La Raja analyzed newspaper articles about state politics in states with campaign finance laws of varying robustness. La Raja found only a “slight” increase in the number of articles about campaign finance in states with “good disclosure regimes.” La Raja attributed this finding to the “inelastic” public demand for articles containing campaign finance information, and thus newspapers’ reluctance to provide more coverage on the issue. 100



Moreover, many of the newspaper articles La Raja analyzed only provided superficial “horserace” coverage of where candidates stood relative to each other in terms of their campaign funds, or focused on discussions of general “campaign finance policy” 101—not the type of heuristic information that the Buckley __court postulated would “allow[] voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely” or “alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate predictions of future performance in office.” 102



Both the Primo and LaRaja studies are consistent with a self-assessment the National Institute on Money in State Politics (NIMSP) commissioned the RAND Corporation to perform in 2014. 103 As NIMSP’s report pointed out, the Court’s _McCutcheon_ decision cited NIMSP’s website, FollowTheMoney.org, as an example of the “massive quantities of information [that] can be accessed at the click of a mouse,” thus making “disclosure[] effective to a degree not possible at the time _Buckley_ , or even _McConnell_ , was decided.” 104 However, the NIMSP report cited almost no examples of how its donor disclosure data, which it compiles from state records, is actually used in a way that advances the heuristic theory postulated in _Buckley_ of “aid[ing] the voters in evaluating those who seek [public] office.”



Conceding that “the actual impact” of donor disclosure data on the general public likely “is rather low,” the NIMSP report begins by arguing that the “value” of donor disclosure data “can ... be found in the writings of [Supreme Court Justice Louis] Brandeis; the past opinions of the Supreme Court; and in the public campaigns toward greater electoral transparency, as evinced by the creation and operations of the [Federal Election Commission].” 105 This places the cart before the horse, though. Legal regimes requiring disclosure are not, in and of themselves, evidence of the efficacy of disclosure; rather, empirical evidence should be required to justify the existence of such legal regimes.



The NIMSP report then goes on to provide a vague account of how journalists use disclosure data, and little can be concluded from this section of the report about the social value of disclosure. 106 The report’s discussion of how advocacy groups use the disclosure data is quite telling, however. With the exception of one group that purported to use disclosure data to draw a link between campaign funding and elected officials’ positions on criminal justice reform, all other advocacy groups cited appeared to use the disclosure information to advocate on campaign finance disclosure policy, and the list of groups themselves is a who’s who of campaign finance policy lobbying outfits ranging from Americans for Campaign Reform to Transparency International. 107 In short, the NIMSP report suggests that donor disclosure data is being used primarily as the main ingredient in a “self-licking ice cream cone” 108 to advocate for more disclosure, rather than to provide meaningful information to voters.



Real-world examples also suggest that campaign donor information often does not accurately “predict[] future performance in office.” During the 2013 federal government shutdown, the _New York Times_ and the Washington _Post_ both ran articles remarking on how business interests, which had financially supported Republicans and opposed the shutdown, had been “spurned” by or had “los[t] sway” over congressional Republicans who backed the shutdown. 109 Perhaps if the “social class” that finds campaign finance donor disclosure so alluring had focused more on the substance of what certain congressional members and candidates had actually campaigned on, rather than who their financial supporters were, the result would have made more sense to the _Times_ and _Post_.



Another example of the lack of correlation between the sources of candidates’ financial support and their policy positions is the controversy over the Target Corporation’s 2010 contribution to a Minnesota state super PAC that supported gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer. 110 Although Target maintained that the contribution was made to support the super PAC’s economic policy positions, the disclosure of the retailer’s contribution was met with a wave of protests and a petition signed by more than 240,000 individuals threatening to boycott Target because of Emmer’s opposition to same-sex marriage. 111 (Hypocritically, the protest was orchestrated by MoveOn.org, an organization comprised in large part of a 501(c)(4) “dark money” arm that is not required to disclose its own donors. 112)



In fact, Target had a strong record of supporting gay rights 113 and likely did not support Emmer’s position on the issue. Had the disclosure of Target’s political contribution worked the way the Court’s jurisprudence postulated, one would have drawn the wrong conclusion about Emmer’s position on same-sex marriage based on Target’s position on the issue. However, no protesters opposing Target’s contribution likely were laboring under the Court’s misimpression that the disclosure of this information had any heuristic value in determining the candidate’s position on social issues. In fact, the protesters were using disclosure for the opposite purpose: to pressure _the contributor_ to distance itself _from the candidate based on positions of the candidate already known to the protestors_. Regardless of whether one believes this is a legitimate or socially valuable use of disclosure data, it is important to recognize that this is a use of disclosure that is far afield from the justifications the Court has endorsed for compulsory disclosure.



If one goes in search of better justifications for compulsory donor disclosure beyond the Supreme Court’s holdings, the landscape is still rather bleak. The arguments put forward for disclosure often are illogical on their face, contrary to actual experience, inconsistent with other First Amendment precepts, or downright invidious.



For example, former state senator Larry Martin (R-SC), who had been the subject of advertisements criticizing his legislative record during his failed primary bid for reelection, recently explained his support for compulsory disclosure as follows: “They’re able to put a spin on things that you can’t really refute because you don’t know who they are.” 114



U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) makes a similar case for disclosure: “When it’s clear who’s behind an ad ... [w]e can take the sales pitch with a grain of salt, and make an informed decision about whether or not to buy it. The same is true with political ads—to understand them, we need to know who’s behind them.” 115



But readers of the pseudonymous Federalist _Papers_ seemed to have no trouble understanding the arguments presented therein without knowing who “Publius” was. 116 And Anti-Federalists writing as “Cato,” “Centinel,” “The Federal Farmer,” and “Brutus” also apparently faced no impediment in rebutting “Publius” without knowing the latter’s identity. 117 If these examples come across as antiquated, consider the ubiquity of anonymous sources in news reporting in the modern age. Notwithstanding that “Deep Throat’s” identity remained secret for more than 30 years after the Watergate scandal, no one ever claimed an inability to understand the substance of his allegations, which helped bring down a president. 118



Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) made a somewhat more cogent and perhaps more candid—although no more persuasive—argument for disclosure in his (unsuccessful) lawsuit challenging what he alleged to be the FEC’s insufficient disclosure regulations for so-called electioneering communications. Because, according to Van Hollen, the FEC’s rules permit sponsors of such ads to be funded by “anonymous donors,” he claimed injury because he would “not be able to respond by, _inter alia_ , drawing to the attention of the voters in his district the identity of persons whose donations are used to fund” such ads. 119



In other words, unlike his colleague Senator Heitkamp and former state senator Martin, Senator Van Hollen (wisely) did not make the fanciful claim that he would literally be unable to respond to substantive criticism of his public record without knowing the sources of funding for such speech. Rather, what Van Hollen appears to have meant is that he could not refute his critics’ speech by resorting to responses about “the[ir] identity.” For those yearning for more substantive debates in our politics, this argument for ad hominem attacks is hardly a ringing endorsement for compulsory disclosure. Under the framework of our First Amendment jurisprudence, this justification would require a finding that there is a legitimate governmental interest in facilitating the logical fallacy of the argumentum ad hominem. 120



Senator Heitkamp also claimed that “undisclosed money ... makes our democratic process nastier and more divisive.” 121 Likewise, Connecticut state representative Livvy Floren has pointed to a laundry list of “dirty politics and divisiveness, bombast and blasphemy, lies and libel, negativity and nastiness, anger and animosity—all paid for with millions of dollars from anonymous donors” as justification for more compulsory donor disclosure laws. 122 As a counterpoint to this, Professor Charles Kesler of Claremont McKenna College has called the pseudonymously written Federalist Papers a “model of candor, civility, and deliberation for future American political disputes.” 123 And it is not as if candidates have any trouble coarsening the political debate entirely on their own without any anonymous outside help. 124 Moreover, if anything has made our politics “nastier and more divisive,” certainly compulsory disclosure laws are partially responsible, as evidenced by those instances discussed earlier of donors being threatened and harassed as a result of their political contributions having been disclosed. 125



West Virginia state senator Mike Romano has argued for passing a state campaign finance disclosure bill on the grounds that “[p]eople have a harder time lying when they can’t hide behind their checkbooks.” 126 However, speech laws that seek to root out false speech are generally frowned upon as a form of content-based speech regulation, and the Court has endorsed “the common understanding that some false statements are inevitable if there is to be an open and vigorous expression of views in public and private conversation,” as well as the notion that “[t]he remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true.” 127 But this may not matter much; as demonstrated previously, the jurisprudence on campaign finance disclosure laws does not appear to be particularly concerned about consistency with other areas of First Amendment law.



Every so often, compulsory disclosure supporters reveal their true intention of deterring speech. In introducing the DISCLOSE Act in 2010, Sen. Chuck Schumer warned that the bill’s “deterrent effect should not be underestimated.” 128 And just to be clear that Senator Schumer was not quoted out of context, when confronted with his quote in 2014, he not only didn’t disavow it, but he doubled down and reiterated his belief that “when somebody is trying to influence government for their purposes, directly with ads and everything else [in other words, engage in political speech], it’s good to have a deterrent effect.” 129 Senator Heitkamp, somewhat more circumspect than her colleague, has argued that “there’s too much money in politics” (in other words, too much spending on political speech) as a reason for cosponsoring the SUN Act disclosure legislation, which is presumably designed to reduce the amount of speech. 130



This sometimes not-so-subtle effort to use compulsory donor disclosure laws to limit speech runs head-on, however, into what the Court has long held to be our “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” 131 Not only that, but the deterrence of speech diminishes the public’s “right to hear, to learn, to know” 132—a right that also has been held to be fundamental. 133



Moreover, as the Court recognized in _McIntyre_ , compulsory disclosure laws tend to “place[] a more significant burden on advocates of unpopular causes than on defenders of the status quo.” 134 Thus, the deterrent effect that Senator Schumer touts also functions as a de facto content regulation of speech. 135 As Justice Scalia noted in the _McConnell_ case, “[T]his is an area in which evenhandedness is not fairness... . _any_ restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to favor incumbents.” 136 Certainly, Justice Scalia was writing in _McConnell_ about a categorical prohibition of certain “electioneering” speech, and he was elsewhere a full-throated supporter of campaign finance disclosure laws. 137 However, to the extent that the Court has recognized the significant burden disclosure requirements impose on political speech, Scalia’s suspicions about an incumbency protection scheme should apply equally against disclosure laws that all too often are touted by incumbents (as evidenced by the comments of the various federal and state legislators discussed earlier).



Even if these miscellaneous justifications for disclosure were remotely cogent or persuasive, none of these rationales fits within the “informational interest” in helping “voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum” that the Court has endorsed in upholding disclosure laws. Thus, if legislators are designing disclosure laws to further one of these other interests, they should not count on those laws being upheld in litigation.



Nor do these justifications fit within the anti-corruption rationale for disclosure that the Court has endorsed for disclosure of contributions to candidates, and which I have argued no longer justifies disclosure requirements for independent speech in light of recent jurisprudence. However, to the extent advocates of disclosure continue to press the anti-corruption rationale even for disclosure related to independent speech, this point merits a brief response. 138



To reiterate: Under the “exacting scrutiny” standard for judicial review of disclosure laws, the government bears the burden of demonstrating that disclosure of the funding sources of independent political speech helps prevent corruption. 139 Not only does it not appear that the government has met this burden, but it also seems that disclosure could just as easily have the opposite effect. As Judge Easterbrook has observed, disclosure laws “make[] it easier to see who has not done his bit for the incumbents, so that arms may be twisted and pockets tapped.” 140



Similarly, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit opinion noted that when a contribution made to a candidate is disclosed, “the recipient’s competitor will notice, and if the competitor should win the spender will not be among his favorite constituents.” 141 This logic applies equally to a contribution made to an independent super PAC supporting a particular candidate. For example, in 2013, when former New York governor Eliot Spitzer was trying to make a political comeback from his prostitution scandal by running for New York City comptroller, donors reportedly were terrified of contributing to a super PAC supporting his opponent, for fear that the disclosure of their contributions would result in retribution if the famously vindictive Spitzer were elected. 142 The flip side of disclosure’s deterrent effect is that donors seeking to ingratiate themselves with a candidate will have greater incentive to contribute to an independent expenditure effort if their contributions will be disclosed.



Alabama state senator Arthur Orr cited “‘mischievous situations,’ such as a donor contributing to a candidate as an individual and then anonymously giving to a group running ads against that same candidate,” as a reason to require additional disclosure. 143 This is mischievous indeed, since the contribution to the candidate (which is disclosed) would help the donor ingratiate himself or herself with an elected official, while the undisclosed contribution would allow the donor to speak his or her conscience. If a compulsory disclosure law were to close the door on donor privacy in Orr’s example, then the only door left for the donor would be ingratiation.



Although the Democratic Party in recent years generally has supported disclosure laws more than the Republican Party has, several Democrats opposed President Obama’s proposed government contractor disclosure executive order out of concerns that it would facilitate corruption. “We are concerned that requiring businesses to disclose their political activity when making an offer risks injecting politics into the contracting process,” Sen. Claire McCaskill and then-senator Joe Lieberman wrote in a letter to the president. 144



These consequences of disclosure, even if they do not necessarily fall within the definition of quid pro quo corruption that the Court articulated in _Citizens United_ , certainly fit within the broader concept of “corruption” that opponents of _Citizens United_ subscribe to. 145 And they are all counterpoints to the anti-corruption rationale for expanded disclosure laws.



Much of the modern campaign finance disclosure regime presupposes the verity of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis’s famous maxim that “[s]unlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” 146 But just as excessive sunlight also may cause damage, such as blinding, cataracts, and melanoma, 147 the key point that readers should take away from this paper is that there are proper and improper ways to implement disclosure, and a balanced approach is required.



Disclosure’s purpose should be to “allow[] citizens to keep tabs on their elected officials”—not for “the government to monitor its constituents.” 148 The legitimacy of disclosure laws is at its zenith when they focus on government transparency. Open government is essential to representative government and holding officials accountable and responsive to the public. When disclosure laws’ purpose is to monitor private individuals and groups exercising their First Amendment rights, however, such laws become an authoritarian tool for intimidation, retribution, and the suppression of democratic debate.



Thus, if we were to diagram a hierarchy of disclosure laws in decreasing order of legitimacy, it might look something like Figure 1.



With these principles in mind, I recommend the following for how disclosure laws should be amended or implemented:



 **Retain Disclosure of Contributors to Candidates’ Campaign Committees, Political Party Committees, and Traditional PACs, But Raise Disclosure Thresholds.** The anti-corruption rationale is much stronger for requiring donor disclosure for campaign contributions made directly to candidates and elected officials than it is for requiring disclosure of donors to independent groups. Politicians exercise complete or ultimate control over the funds that are given directly to their campaign committees. Although most jurisdictions now prohibit campaign funds from being used for personal expenses, 149 such funds are still highly valuable to politicians, most of whom seem to be motivated by getting elected or reelected as much as (or more than) anything else in life. 150 To the extent that political party committees and traditional PACs (i.e., those that are not super PACs) coordinate with and make contributions directly to candidates, requiring such entities to report their donors also is appropriate. 151



 **Figure 1**  
Legitimacy of disclosure laws  




Nonetheless, the existing law requires excessive disclosure of small donors. The current threshold for disclosure of donors applies to anyone who gives more than $200 during a calendar year to a federal candidate, political party committee, or PAC, 152 and some states even purport to require disclosure of donors who give so much as a penny. 153 These days, no one believes that giving $201 (much less a penny) to a congressional or presidential candidate is going to get donors more than a thank you note signed by an autopen (if even that). Relatedly, an organization that merely accepts contributions or makes expenditures totaling more than $1,000 could be required to register as a federal PAC, which in turn triggers broad donor disclosure requirements. 154 Most disclosure thresholds are not adjusted for inflation. Even ardent supporters of more compulsory disclosure laws agree that the donor disclosure thresholds should be raised so that small donors are not unnecessarily disclosed. 155 These thresholds also should be pegged to inflation so that they are not eroded over time.



 **Limit Disclosure Requirements for Independent Speech.** As the Court has postulated of independent political speech: “The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.” 156 Real-world examples corroborate this assessment. Individuals have long been permitted to make independent expenditures in unlimited amounts urging the election or defeat of candidates, 157 and since 2010 have been permitted to contribute unlimited amounts to super PACs. 158 Nonetheless, we have seen donors regularly risking and incurring serious criminal penalties to make “straw contributions” to candidates (i.e., reimbursing others for making contributions to circumvent per-individual contribution limits). 159 This is strong evidence that donors agree with the Court’s view that contributions given directly to candidates’ campaign coffers may have more ingratiation value than independent spending.



Relatedly, absent compulsory disclosure requirements, there is an inherent information asymmetry between direct contributions to candidates and funds given to and spent by independent speakers. Regardless of any disclosure laws, politicians certainly know who is contributing to their campaign accounts. However, without campaign finance reports, politicians generally would not know, and would have difficulty verifying, whether donors are giving to independent groups unless they were looking at the groups’ bank statements and canceled checks. Given concerns about running afoul of coordination laws, this seems unlikely.



In short, when applied to independent speech, disclosure laws serve, at best, an attenuated societal interest in preventing corruption, and may even facilitate corruption by enabling politicians to verify who is and is not contributing to independent efforts to support their campaigns. 160 As explained earlier, there also does not appear to be any evidentiary support for the heuristic or “informational interest” in disclosure. Thus, compulsory donor disclosure laws should be applied as sparingly as possible to independent political speech.



If disclosure requirements for independent speech must be enacted:



The use of “census or other standard government occupation categories” on disclosure reports in lieu of a donor’s name and other personal information, as Stanford professor Bruce E. Cain has suggested, also warrants further consideration. 164 This may better serve the purported heuristic or “informational interest” in disclosure (to the extent that real-world evidence shows this interest exists), while shielding individual donors from the threat of harassment and retaliation.



We live in an age in which support for free speech is under siege. The very idea of free speech has come to be associated with white supremacists and other odious causes. 165 Hundreds of speakers have been disinvited from institutions of higher education because of disagreements with their viewpoints. 166 Beating opponents in debate is no longer enough; instead, they have to be physically beaten—or even killed—if we don’t like what they have to say. 167 Objectionable speech must be preceded by “trigger warnings,” 168 and the liberty to speak is banished to designated “free speech zones.” 169 Forty percent of millennials support laws to prohibit certain offensive speech—far more than any other generation polled. 170 Both sides of the ideological spectrum denounce the other side’s news sources as “fake news.” 171



In this environment, it is more important than ever for individuals to have the option to speak collectively without the fear of reprisals and threats that too frequently result from having their names, addresses, and employer information posted on the Internet as a result of compulsory donor disclosure laws. Unfortunately, the debate over disclosure and donor privacy has become just as polarized as the debates over the substantive issues that donors wish to engage in. The FEC, for example, for more than 20 years used to routinely approve exempting the Socialist Workers Party from donor disclosure requirements. 172 But lately, certain commissioners at the agency caught in the disclosure fever have deadlocked on renewing this exemption for the Socialist Workers. 173



Such an absolutist stance in favor of disclosure is unwarranted. Disclosure is not an unalloyed good. Rather, it is a policy prescription that must be approached with more nuance, especially in light of the serious constitutional concerns and tangible harms that are implicated. Judicial holdings underpinning the present-day push for more compulsory disclosure laws should be examined more critically, especially for outdated or unsupported assumptions. And policy justifications for disclosure should be viewed with more skepticism, especially when they are advanced by incumbent lawmakers who have a conflict of interest in passing laws that hinder speech unfavorable to them.

From the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres a clear indication for those “CO2 is plant food” scoffers that the plants don’t care what they think.
Productivity of land plants may be greater than previously thought
Researchers recommend the reworking of global carbon models in Nature
This press release is available in German.
For the news study the reseachers analyzed also datas of the Cape Grim air archive at CSIRO's Aspendale laboratories. The Air Archive is an irreplaceable collection of air samples from Cape Grim, northwest Tasmania. It is like a library or museum of air that provides valuable information about greenhouse and ozone depleting gases. Every three months, researchers have filled stainless steel flasks with about 1 000 litres of pristine air, which is then stored in the Cape Grim Air Archive at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research in Aspendale, Victoria. The Cape Grim Air Archive was initiated by Dr Paul Fraser in 1978, knowing that one day scientists might be interested in measuring gases that at the time were not being (or could not be) measured. CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research near Melbourne in Australia undertakes research into the atmospheric environment and belongs to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

London – The global uptake of carbon by land plants may be up to 45 per cent more than previously thought. This is the conclusion of an international team of scientists, based on the variability of heavy oxygen atoms in the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere driven by the El Niño effect. As the oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide were converted faster than expected during the El Niño years, current estimates for the uptake of carbon by plants are probably too low. These should be corrected upwards, say the researchers in the current issue of the scientific journal NATURE. Instead of 120 petagrams of carbon, the annual global vegetation uptake probably lies between 150 and 175 petagrams of carbon. This value is a kind of gross national product for land plants and indicates how productive the biosphere of the Earth is. The reworking of this so-called global primary productivity would have significant consequences for the coupled carbon cycle-climate model used in climate research to predict future climate change.
Lisa Welp of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego and her colleagues evaluated the data for the global isotopic composition of the greenhouse gas CO2 over the last 30 years. This analysis indicated regular fluctuations between years and a connection with the El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific. Overall, El Niño years are warmer. They are also characterised by greater precipitation in South America and less intensive monsoons in Southeast Asia.

The researchers found a more rapid recovery of the

isotopic ratios following the El Niño events than assumed, indicating a shorter conversion time for CO2 in the terrestrial biosphere. On the basis of these data, the authors calculate the so-called global primary productivity (GPP). They now propose correcting this in the global models from 120 to 150-175 petagrams) of carbon annually.
Since 1977 the isotopic ratios in the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere (18O/16O und 13C/12C) have been measured in order to better understand the global carbon cycle, as the exchange processes between the biosphere, the atmosphere and the oceans are reflected in these values. “We assume that the redistribution of moisture and rain in the tropics during El Niño raises the 18O/16O ratio in precipitation and plant water and then signals this to the atmospheric carbon dioxide”, explains Lisa Welp the new approach of the researchers.
“Our atmosphere is a perfect blender. Changes in its levels of trace gases – such as carbon dioxide – reflect the overall release and uptake of trace gases from all sources. So if you measure the carbon exchange of a forest ecosystem, for example, you “only” get the net exchange of all the carbon taken up by the trees for photosynthesis and all the carbon released by the trees and soil “, writes Dr. Matthias Cuntz of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in his commentary in the same issue of NATURE. The gross-exchange fluxes, such as photosynthesis, are however accessible only with difficulty. “Global estimates therefore depend upon a number of assumptions. This includes, for example, how many of the CO2 molecules entering a plant are actually fixed by photosynthesis. The researchers of Lisa Welp’s team assume that around 43 per cent of all CO2 molecules entering a plant are taken up by the plant. If this were only 34%, the estimate would fall to about 120 billion tons of carbon – that is, to the currently accepted value”, for Matthias Cuntz reason of thought. In his opinion, the new findings do not completely upset the research to date. Nevertheless, they demonstrate an interesting new method for the determination of plant productivity over large areas. In future, the combination of several isotopic methods with conventional measurements represents a promising approach.
The now published study was carried out under the direction of Ralph F. Keeling, a professor of oceanography and the son of the late Charles David Keeling, after whom the so-called Keeling curve was named. This graph shows the concentration of CO2 of the volcano Mauna Loa on Hawaii since the year 1957. In the 1950s the CO2 fraction in the earth’s atmosphere was still around 315 ppm. In 2011, by comparison, it has already increased to 390 ppm. With his measurements Keeling was able to show for the first time that the concentration of the greenhouse gas increases in relation to changing land use and the combustion of fossil fuels. This new study underscores the importance of long-term measurements of the isotope 18O in the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere from the scientific point of view, as this occupies a key position between the carbon cycle and the hydrogen cycle.

From the December 2010 big snow
It seem airport operator BAA has realized that Global warming has really dumped on them the last two years and rather than be caught with their pants down again, they 3x increased their equipment and staff ready to clear snow.
From BBC: Heathrow airport triples snow clearance fleet
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15105627
Heathrow airport has tripled the number of snow clearance vehicles to tackle severe winter weather.
Operator BAA also has three times as many staff ready to clear snow compared with last year.
Thousands of passengers were left stranded at the airport as 4,000 flights were cancelled over five days for heavy snow before Christmas. 

But BAA said it now has 185 snow clearance vehicles and has 468 staff per shift, compared to 117 last year.
The operator said it has invested £32.4m so far to tackle severe weather.
BAA had been criticised following last year’s disruptions and a report accused the operator of a breakdown in communication and lack of “preparedness” for the bad weather.
After the publication of the Winter Resilience Enquiry Report, BAA promised to invest £50m to avoid facing disruptions on a similar scale.
Announcing its “winter resilience programme”, the airports operator said it has introduced a new “reservist” role whereby up to 950 staff will be deployed to the terminals to help passengers during disruption.

 _ **One Nation Under Contract: The Outsourcing of American Power and the Future of Foreign Policy**_  
By Allison Stanger  
Yale University Press, 256 pages



Of all the books published about private military and security contractors in recent years, with more coming out all the time, few really understand the phenomenon of outsourcing roles that were formerly the preserve of government.



Either they are academic theses and dissertations rewritten for public consumption, such as Peter Singer’s _Corporate Warriors_ , a rare useful book on the subject; ill‐​concealed hysterical jeremiads masquerading as dispassionate journalism, such as Jeremy Scahill’s over‐​the‐​top fulminations against Blackwater; or breathless “I was there taking fire in the sandbox” memoirs from conflict zones.



Not many authors have paused to consider exactly what is going on. To paraphrase what was said about the US intelligence community after the September 11, 2001, attacks, they don’t connect the dots. Finally someone has.



That someone is Allison Stanger, professor of international politics and economics at Middlebury College in the United States.



Stanger points out firstly that private contractors are working for more parts of the US government than just the Pentagon or State Department. Secondly, contrary to popular assumptions, most private contractors working in areas that used to be the exclusive preserves of government, such as foreign policy, military and intelligence sectors, homeland security, or foreign aid, are not a bunch of unscrupulous greed heads, although they are certainly in pursuit of profit.



Stanger does not only focus on the for‐​profit private contractors doing military and security work. She also looks at the Department of Homeland Security, and the non‐​profit players working in the development field. When foreign aid contributions by the private sector dwarf those of the US Agency for International Development, and in any case most of USAID’s work is done by contractors, one wonders what the point of it is.



The ubiquitousness of such contractors is a sign that something both revolutionary and global in scope is happening that can only become more prevalent.



As Stanger recognizes, what is going on is essentially a manifestation of globalization. She notes:



Globalization and our penchant for privatization have transformed power itself, expanding the range of options for individuals to make a difference. When Washington outsources so much of its work in the private sector, the old debate about the size of government is rendered moot. We don’t need big government or small government. We need good government. And good government in the information age will harness all the networks at its disposal to advance the public interest.



Since privatization is intimately connected to globalization, one can’t do away with the former without damaging the latter.



The problem of most commentators, regardless of whether they are supporters or critics of outsourcing and privatization, is outmoded thinking. They are like the old war planners who used to worry about the Soviet Union overrunning Western Europe and not having a clue that the real threat was non‐​governmental groups like al‐​Qaeda.



The very definition of power in the 21st century has changed. While outsourcing has its problems, it can also be a source of creative bottom‐​up initiatives with an undeniable foreign policy impact. With Bono of the rock group U2 fighting AIDS in Africa, Walmart promoting energy efficiency, and Al Gore moving forward the global debate over climate change, foreign policy isn’t just for diplomats anymore.



This post‐​Cold War collection of actors constitutes a new kind of empire, one that has no ruler or subjects. It is truly a coalition of the willing. While it would not exist without the American contribution, the US does not control it. That makes outsourcing both inviting and unpredictable. It advances its interests through the power of ideals: economic freedom, equality of opportunity and sustainability.



This global empire could, in Stanger’s view, work for the benefit of all. But doing so would have to first acknowledge that the current practice of unenlightened outsourcing creates an enormous accountability vacuum that has enabled gross fiscal irresponsibility, dangerous apathy among the public, and the “inadvertent” militarization of foreign policy. “Inadvertent” likely gives too much the benefit of the doubt to American policymakers, but that is secondary to Stanger’s thesis.



It is a sign of how ideologues have dominated the debate over the role of government in society in the past few decades that her diagnosis of the pros and cons is really quite unsurprising. To argue, as she does, that “outsourcing as presently practiced is scandalous, but turning the clock back and reasserting top‐​down government control though it is no solution”, something that Ronald Reagan and Al Gore could agree on.



Essentially, Stanger is not just calling for limits on what contractors can do, as do many critics. She is also calling for government to step up to the plate to resume its role as the irreplaceable “chief custodian of the public interest”. Anybody who has even cursorily studied this issue in recent years and read the reports from auditing agencies such as the US Government Accountability Office, the Defense Contracting Audit Agency, the Defense Contracting Management Agency, various agency inspector generals and listened to congressional hearings understands that government has been missing in action.



Stanger correctly notes that it is easy to point fingers. But that risks missing the forest for the trees. She writes:



It is easy to see things gone awry and to scapegoat contractors. But contractors aren’t the problem; the problem is the loss of good government. If the contractors in Iraq seem wildly expensive, it is not because corporate greed has dictated outcomes but because government’s aspirations there have been far too ambitious and its controls far too few. When private security forces overstep moral bounds it is ultimately government’s responsibility for having deployed them in a conflict zone with too little legal recourse if they misbehaved.



None of the above is to say that Stanger thinks outsourcing is without problems. While she recognizes it is here to stay, she is not reluctant to list its shortcomings. In that regard, a section in chapter two detailing the US government’s feeble attempts to keep track of what it is outsourcing and paying for it is revelatory.



Likewise, chapter five, where she demolishes the cost‐​savings arguments made by advocates of defense privatization, which have been meekly accepted as true without empirical proof for far too long, is worth the price of the book alone.



She also notes numerous examples of contracting run amuck, the difficulties of oversight due to the web of subcontracting (which the government has only recently started tracking) and the way that state secrecy, aided by contractors’ frequent excuse that proprietary business information cannot be released, compounds the problem.



The bottom line for Stanger is that the laissez‐​faire ideology where government forks money out to the private sector and gets out of the way — so popular among free marketers and recent Republican and Democrat administrations — is not acceptable.



While the private sector is both integrated into and crucial to American foreign policy, it is not entitled to a blank check or a blind eye. Government has a rightful role to play. It can start by not assigning tasks, such as reconstruction, that should belong to other agencies, to the Pentagon. Such actions only further strengthen an already grotesquely militarized US foreign policy. Such a policy plays to American weakness, not American strength, because it is economically unsustainable, alienates allies and denudes the universal values that made America popular in the world to begin with.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European media are just too embarrassed about having gotten it completely wrong when it comes to global warming. So they just continue pretending that the cold isn’t really happening. As people are freezing to death all around them this winter, they keep telling themselves (and us) it’s getting warmer! I’ve never witnessed such an astonishingly surreal situation.

Death toll due to cold keeps climbing in Eastern Europe. Photo credit: NOAA public domain photo.
As hundreds of lives are being lost this winter, the media refuse to see it, talk about it, to believe it. Instead they keep telling the people something has to be done about the warming. They tell us about Australia 20,000 km away. This is like watching a weird Star Trek episode of a planet where people are walking around like zombies. Can someone send a doctor over to declare this media brain dead?
To get the news about the deadly cold that is gripping Europe, Russia, Siberia and a large part of Asia, you really have to search beyond the flat-line mainstream media.
For example, Blick website today has the story on how so far this winter over 300 people have frozen to death in Eastern Europe:

Many cold deaths in Poland and Russia
Because of the cold, many persons in Poland, Russia and Lithuania have died. because of the forecast temperature fall to -20°C in the coming days, the Ministry of Interior in Warsaw on Tuesday has reminded the public to be more cautious. […]
19 people have frozen since the beginning of the year in Poland, 3 on Sunday alone. So far this winter more than 100 people have died. After water pipes had burst because of freezing, tens of thousands of Poles are now cut off from electricity.
In Russia the number of deaths due to the cold has climbed to about 190, this according to authorities in Moscow via Interfax news agency. Just in the last few days alone 7 people died of hypothermia.”

The death toll does not include the dozens that have died in Belarus, Ukraine and the rest of Eastern Europe, and so it is likely much higher.
Photo above is actually of the North Pole, and is to convey that it’s cold out.

Environment Southland who recently [voted against declaring a ‘climate emergency’. ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/113951238/southland-climate-emergency-motion-voted-down)The only other council to do so in New Zealand so far is Thames-Coromandel.



[…] It’s a relief to see some common sense after so many councils have jumped on the climate emergency bandwagon. The trend doesn’t seem likely to let up soon, so expect your council to vote on a declaration soon (if it hasn’t already).

"Nearly a third of all the food produced in the world is lost or wasted, according to the UN’s World Resources Institute. If we convert this mass into calories, it constitutes nearly a quarter of all food produced, which could have fed hungry and malnourished people around the world. But new technology that prolongs the life of fresh fruit and vegetables can help minimise this huge amount of waste. It is a sad irony that we waste so much food – especially fruit and vegetables – but still fail to feed the world’s ever increasing population. Clearly, our ability to produce larger quantities of fruit and vegetables is not the only guarantee for global food security. We need to start minimising the amount of food that is produced and then lost. Loss happens when food is spilt in transit or spoilt from heavy bruising or wilting. It is the unplanned result of an agricultural process gone wrong or technical limitations in storage, infrastructure, packaging or marketing. Good food is also wasted when it is simply thrown away before or after it spoils. A key way to minimise the amount of food lost is through postharvest technology, which can help make food last longer without losing nutrients. Once developed, it needs to be integrated into the global supply chain of food production. We need to optimise the food we already produce, especially in developing countries. This can be done by significantly improving the way food is handled after harvesting, particularly to make the process more hygienic. We should make sure postharvest techniques are environmentally friendly and, of course, non-toxic to humans when applied to food. The use of natural biodegradable products as an alternative to synthetic chemicals has shown remarkable improvements in maintaining fruit quality and extending shelf life. These natural products are non-toxic to humans and safe. Chitosan, for example, is a natural product obtained from crustacean shells. It has been shown to significantly maintain papaya fruit when applied to it. In combination with Gum Arabic (hardened sap obtained from the acacia tree) it can also delay the ripening of bananas. Gum Arabic can also be used on its own to enhance the shelf life and postharvest quality of tomatoes. Cinnamon oil is another natural product that has been shown to delay postharvest rotting in bananas and extending their storage life for up to 28 days. Our research at the Centre of Excellence for Post-harvest Biotechnology at Nottingham University’s Malaysia Campus is making these natural products into nano-forms or submicron particles to control postharvest diseases. This technology has so far been used to delay ripening in tomatoes and enhance their phenolic content, as well as extending the life of dragon fruit for up to 28 days. These are just a few examples, with many more being developed to improve the quality and shelf life of fresh fruit to help stop it going to waste. The way that fresh food is packaged is crucial to how long it can last. Synthetic chemicals are currently used to control postharvest diseases but consumers worry about the chemical residues they leave on fruit, their environmental impact and the potential for pathogens to become resistant to them. Our research is a response to this,  developing more environmentally friendly and non-chemical approaches.  This includes packing food in containers that modify the atmosphere to prevent decay, hot water treatment or blanching and most importantly using natural biodegradable products as an alternative to synthetic chemicals. Once proper postharvest technologies are used efficiently, food losses can be minimised and the problem of food insecurity alleviated. We believe that developing postharvest management techniques using natural products is the way forward, especially since these natural biodegradable products we are researching can also contribute to traditional medicine and pharmacology as we learn more about our natural environment. Hopefully too, we can develop better ways of reducing the huge amount of food loss that takes place and focus on getting food to those who need it."

I was out today for a walk. Although here the temperature read -2°C, the strong wind from the Northeast cut into you like a knife – it’s horrendous. To me it felt like -20°C. It’s going to get worse before better. RTL reports it’s going to get even colder in the days ahead:
Tonight in some cities again new cold records will be set for March. While the Brocken has already shattered the old record of -13.9°C  (21 March 1980) with a reading of -14,5°C, in other cities like Berlin it could be the coldest night in over 100 years.”
To be fair, they mean the coldest March temperatures in a 100 years.
RTL also writes that also Great Britain “has been transformed into a winter wonderland” with “thousands of schools closing in Ireland on Friday.”
Motorists had to be rescued from highways as cars were trapped in drifting snow.
In the city of Kiev in Ukraine a half meter of snow fell during a snow storm that hit Friday night. Officials have declared a state of emergency for the city’s 3 million inhabitants.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Saturday. We'll have another update for you on Sunday.**
If MPs do not back the government's tougher three-tier system when lockdown in England ends, hospitals could become ""overwhelmed"", Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has warned. The government is facing opposition from Tory MPs over the new restrictions, which begin on 2 December. MPs are due to vote on the new measures ahead of their introduction. Labour is yet to decide whether it will support the restrictions. It has warned, however, that areas in tier three will be stretched to ""breaking point"" without further financial support from the Treasury.
Drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions in England will have to leave when they finish eating, No 10 has confirmed. Pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant, with alcohol only being served as part of a ""substantial meal"". The PM's spokesman said: ""We've been clear that, in tier two I believe, that you need to have a substantial meal if ordering any alcohol and it remains the case that the guidance says that once the meal is finished, it is at that point [you have to leave]."" So, what exactly are you allowed to do in each tier?
Mass testing plans in England could become a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine, health leaders have warned. Boris Johnson said that mass community testing, as seen in Liverpool, will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends. But experts said it requires ""enormous"" resources. In a joint statement, the Faculty of Public Health and the Association of Directors of Public Health said improving NHS Test and Trace must remain the top focus for testing. How does mass testing work?
Denmark's government has been urged to dig up millions of mink that were buried in mass graves. A mutated form of the virus on Danish fur farms prompted a cull of nearly 17 million of the animals. Two burial sites in Jutland are highly controversial, with one near a bathing lake and the other not far from a source of drinking water.
Recovery services have had to adapt in 2020, with some people using video-conferencing software to kick their drug and alcohol addictions. Jade Hargreaves, from Burnley, has been sober for three years and said losing face-to-face meetings was difficult. ""But people have got clean this year on Zoom and that's amazing. Hats off to them because it's hard,"" she said.

"There is a boom in renewable energy sources coming online worldwide, but the predominant types – solar and wind – are problematic due to their variable nature. For most regions of the world, the sun cannot be expected to shine nor the wind blow when required. What is needed is a way to capture that energy when available, perhaps in the middle of the night, when demand is low, and then store it until it can be used when demand rises. But this is not a trivial problem to solve. According to the European Wind Energy Association, at the end of 2013, the UK had 10.5GW of wind turbine capacity installed, with more in planning and construction. As the percentage of energy generated from renewables increases, the intermittency problem becomes more acute, as has been seen in countries like Germany or Ireland. Germany, the country with the highest renewable capacity in Europe, has faced major technical problems due to the intermittency of renewable energy. The main issue is maintaining sufficient supply in the face of fluctuating levels of wind or sunshine. Back-up supply in the form of conventional power plants is required to meet demand. But as different types of power plant take time to come online – 48 hours for nuclear, 12 hours for coal-fired, down to a few hours for modern gas power plants, or ten seconds for the water released from a dam to start the turbines – having a back-up always available means having power plants running most of the time, which is inefficient and expensive. Another problem is integrating renewable energy supplies into the high voltage electricity grid. For example, in Ireland given the fact that there is more wind at night when many businesses usage is low, a significant percentage of the energy produced may have been dumped, because the electricity produced cannot easily be transmitted across the grid. So a means of storing energy is a vital part of any future energy system that includes a substantial amount of variable and uncontrollable renewable energy. Energy storage provides flexibility and reduces the need to rely on fossil fuel back-up power. Current energy storage technologies in use include direct electrical storage in batteries, thermal storage as hot water or in the fabric of buildings, using compressed air energy storage, or chemical storage (hydrogen). But identifying which approach is best is complex.  The right storage mix has to match the nature of the renewable energy source, the demands asked of the power grid, and the physical nature of the landscape and geology – as well as political and public opinion too. A lack of clear vision for energy storage means governments fail to adopt a joined-up approach. So while wind turbines and solar panels are blossoming under government programmes to support them, few governments recognise the importance of storage as the missing piece. In Japan, for instance, 15% of supplied electricity has been cycled through a storage facility, whereas in Europe it is closer to 10%, with Germany being the leading nation. In Germany, authorities have opted for pumped hydro storage as an energy storage solution, and has built a regulatory framework around it. Current UK energy storage deployment consists of pumped hydro (3,000MW), batteries (10MW) and liquid air (0.3MW). The UK’s geography restricts the possibility for pumped hydro despite its appeal, and the same goes for compressed air storage. But the UK government’s current technology-neutral view runs the risk that some of the alternative technologies not yet ready for deployment will not have the support they need to develop in time to address the challenge they are required to meet. So the UK’s solutions could be limited to hydrogen storage, batteries, or liquid air.   An analysis in 2012 indicated storage would have the greatest effect when deployed closest to demand. There may be a case for installing energy storage at the building level, in blocks of flats or residential areas, industrial estates or commercial districts – far more widely than at it is at present. In Japan, for example, sodium-sulfur batteries have been installed widely and successfully at the electricity distribution level, something that could be replicated in the UK. The Japanese government has also provided support for installing residential fuel cells in order to drive down prices. Between 2004 and 2008 prices dropped by 73%, and the installed base is increasing year on year – Japanese investment that the UK and others could capitalise on, and indeed, more international collaboration is needed. With many storage technologies and varying applications, there is no single perfect storage technology that will suit all. But if we are to hang our low-carbon future on renewables like wind and solar, then governments need to focus on supporting industry to develop energy storage tech – or risk fossil fuel dependence for many decades hence."
"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday. We'll have another update for you on Monday morning.**
Boris Johnson has written to Conservative MPs telling them tier restrictions will be reviewed every two weeks and promising them a new vote on the measures in January, in an attempt to avert a rebellion in the Commons this week. The prime minister also appealed to the nation in a separate letter to support the tiered system and not to ""blow"" the sacrifices that had already been made. He said: ""We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus.""
More than 150 people have been arrested during anti-lockdown protests in London's West End. Some protesters brandished signs reading ""All I want for Christmas is my freedom back"", ""Ditch the face masks"" and ""Stop controlling us"". The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday evening it had been a ""challenging day"". It said it made arrests for a number of different offences, including breaching coronavirus restrictions, assaulting a police officer and illegal drugs.
Peak rail fares should be suspended over Christmas and mass testing should be provided for transport workers to avoid travel ""chaos"" when restrictions ease, Labour has said. From 23-27 December, three households in the UK will be able to form a ""bubble"", with a surge in travel expected. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is too important for the government to ignore or leave until to the last minute. This is about protecting lives and livelihoods."" Here's what you need to know if you're travelling this Christmas.
The government has secured a further two million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from US firm Moderna, which has shown to be 95% effective in trials. This brings the UK's Moderna order to seven million - enough for around 3.5 million people. Meanwhile, Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed to oversee the rollout of the jabs in England. And we look at how memes are presenting disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.
Teachers have warned of a ""collapse"" in secondary school attendance after the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn.
Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate.
What impact is that having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams?

"Changing the rules by which nuclear power stations are judged to be safe or not may sound unpalatable to some, even outright dangerous. But this is what the Office of Nuclear Regulation is considering in order to extend the life of Britain’s ageing reactor fleet. Rest assured, however, such things are done carefully.  The adjustment would alter the level of graphite loss in the reactor core that is deemed safe. Several of the UK’s second generation Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) power stations are due to close in the next few years. Graphite is a moderator and it is fundamental to the nuclear reaction in an AGR power station. Allowing those AGR plants with higher rates of graphite loss to continue generating power could cover the looming energy gap between supply and demand over the next ten years. The regulator insists it “would not allow continued operation of any nuclear reactor unless it was safe to do so”.  The AGR is a unique British concept. The 14 reactors provide roughly 15% of Britain’s electricity, but were built in the 1970s and 1980s and some are approaching 40 years old. While the UK has embarked on a process to construct new nuclear power stations, starting at Hinkley Point C near Bristol, these are still at least a decade away from being connected to the grid. In the absence of life extensions for the ageing AGRs, and possibly even with them, there are real concerns as to whether our electricity security can be assured.  Right now the UK has more than enough power stations, but as coal-fired plants close due to age or as emissions restrictions bite, this comfort is expected to erode unless for example new, gas-fuelled plants can fill the gap. Most renewables, such as wind or solar power, are not sufficiently reliable to ensure electricity supply at all times of high demand. This reveals extending the supply of nuclear power from existing sources to be both economically and socially important. It is also potentially highly profitable for the operator EDF, whose experts have argued that life extension is safe, but that is another story.  Graphite is a key component of the British AGR power stations. The age-related erosion and cracking of graphite in the reactor core represents a potentially life-limiting issue. Expert assessment and conservative judgement is required to determine whether allowing the reactors to keep running is a safe option for a nuclear power station beyond its licensed lifetime. Extending the life of a 40-year-old nuclear power station is not something that is done lightly.  Clearly graphite is not the only issue, it is merely one of many.    The US has benefited from extending its own ageing reactor fleet, but its light water reactor technology replaces the graphite moderator and carbon dioxide gas coolant of the AGR design with ordinary (“light”) water. So while the experience in the US shows the potential benefits of life extensions, the UK effort to extend the life of AGR reactors involves the exploration of much new territory. It is well known that the AGR fleet has had its difficulties – notoriously, Dungeness B took more than 23 years to complete. Nevertheless these machines are technologically impressive: operating at more than 600°C they are the highest temperature nuclear power stations in the world, making them (in a thermodynamic sense) among the most efficient generators of electricity.  The regulator is proud of its independence. In the face of nuclear anxieties after the disaster at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, and conversely in the face of political pressure to help keep the lights on, it has a steady mission “to provide efficient and effective regulation of the nuclear industry, holding it to account on behalf of the public”. It is a most important role.  Amidst all the talk of graphite one risks missing another story from recent days concerning nuclear safety regulation. This other news concerns claims of conflicts of interest, with the same nuclear companies it regulates also providing the Office of Nuclear Regulation with technical advice. Given that public trust is so often an issue of trust in institutions and people, rather than in technologies or science, it is this other story that perhaps deserves to be getting more attention.  If the life extension of Dungeness B and other power stations are approved, then as electricity consumers, we should be pleased. What is vital to public confidence is honest and professional action by EDF as the operator and the Office of Nuclear Regulation as the independent safety regulator. If that is in hand, then there’s nothing in the recent talk of graphite that should give us particular cause to worry. "
