"NILES, Mich.  —   When Jennifer Purucker, 31, was asked on Saturday morning what she thought of the Women’s March on Washington, she took a sip of coffee and shook her head. “Never heard of it,” she said. Crystal Mangold, 38, paused as she carried her young daughter down Main Street. “No idea what it is,” she said. Angie Searles, 45, perked up at the mention. “Oh, I just saw that on the news,” she said. “I don’t know anyone who’s going. ” The march galvanized hundreds of thousands of women across the country who packed buses and airplanes to flock to the nation’s capital to fight for reproductive and civil rights under the Trump administration. Across the country, they rallied en masse on Saturday in downtowns, wearing pink   knit “pussy hats,” waving handmade signs and sharing pictures on social media with the hashtag #WomensMarch. But as conversations unfolded in Niles, a riverfront town of 11, 000 in southwest Michigan, it was a reminder of how the country has become a split screen on issue after issue. “Those women don’t represent me or my viewpoints,” said Leta Nielsen, 66, a retired teacher, who added that she hoped that demonstrators would not start fires like the ones she saw on the news from the protests surrounding the inauguration on Friday. In Niles, the biggest draw of the weekend was the annual ice festival, which attracted people from all over the region to admire elaborate ice sculptures lining the sidewalks, participate in a 5K race and sample the tall, spicy bloody marys at the Brass Eye cocktail lounge. “I don’t think my husband would support me going,” said Stephanie Palmisano, 26, a medical worker who supported Hillary Clinton but whose husband voted for President Trump. “Trump winning has caused a lot of tough conversations in our marriage. I have two little girls. For a president who thinks so low of women, it just breaks my heart. ” Lucy VandenHeede, 79, said that her    and two granddaughters had taken a bus to Washington from Kalamazoo, Mich. to attend the march and that she was cheering them on from afar. Women’s rights have come a long way, she said, recalling the days when she worked in the newspaper business selling advertising and was paid far less than her male colleagues. “They earned commission, and I didn’t,” she said. “And I was always called ‘Mrs. John VandenHeede.’ I didn’t even have a name. ” “She was the best salesman in the bunch, too,” said her husband, Mr. VandenHeede. Other women sharply questioned the notion of protesting a president whose administration had begun only the day before. “It’s kind of offensive,” said Linda Hine, 56, an accounting manager who voted for Mr. Trump. “People are just criticizing because they didn’t get their way. All it did was force another reason for people to be divided. ” Ms. Hine interpreted Mr. Trump’s inaugural speech on Friday as a generous, uplifting call to bring people together, contradicting the belief of others that it had painted an overly dark and gloomy picture of the country. “It was about unity,” she said. Her friend Kim Redman, 48, said that as opponents of abortion, they would not have felt welcome at the march anyway, echoing a frequent complaint that only women who favor abortion rights were encouraged to attend. If women would just give Mr. Trump a chance, he might not be as bad as they expect, she said. “He’s our president no matter what,” she said. Why do women need a march at all, some people asked, when they have made so many gains in the past few decades? “Women have equal opportunities in the workplace now. We’ve got minorities in jobs. The glass ceilings have opened up all across the nation,” said Tammy Chesney, 53, a carpenter, adding that she had never experienced discrimination on the job. She shrugged off Mr. Trump’s comments that he had grabbed women’s genitals without asking permission. “It wasn’t nice,” she said. “But he apologized, and it was in the past. It was blown all out of proportion. ” There are bigger concerns in Niles than expanding the rights of women, many people said. They worry about the state of local schools, the cost of health care and the town’s economy, which has struggled with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to “Make America Great Again” had special resonance in Rust Belt towns like Niles, said Tracy Guetterman, 49, a retail manager, as she stopped to show her    granddaughter Melanie an ice sculpture in the shape of “U. S. A. ” “Personally, I’d love to see our country go back to one parent working, like the good old days,” she said. “I want to be able to quit my job. ” Ms. Guetterman saw the marches as nothing more than complaining from liberals. “Quit blaming everybody for your problems,” she said. “Get out there and do it yourself. ” Yet many of the sentiments from the Women’s March were echoed in the voices of people in Niles, about 600 miles from Washington. Diane Kellenburger, 69, a retired executive for a nonprofit organization who had purple streaks in her gray hair, showed off a gold medal from the 5K race, where she had the fastest finish in her age group. She had friends who went to a nearby march in Valparaiso, Ind. and she shared their disgust at Mr. Trump’s attitude toward women. “Personally, that’s why I didn’t vote for him,” she said. “We’ve come so far with women’s rights. I have a high level of concern that we’re stepping backward. ” Kim Shelton sat behind the counter of her memorabilia shop downtown, a business that she said is dependent on tourists, as local people have so little to spend these days. Michigan flipped to Mr. Trump, she insisted, because its residents believe he is a successful businessman who can turn things around. Ms. Shelton is not so sure whether he will pull that off, she said, but she is convinced that he does not respect women like her. “I keep hoping, but I don’t think he’s going to change,” she said. “I think women are going to take a few steps back with Trump. ”"

 **Matt Ridley** ’s reputation is dichotomous: on the one hand, he is indelibly stained in the minds of many with the failure of Northern Rock bank – one of the first rumbles of the Global Financial Crisis.



On the other hand, Ridley has a well-deserved reputation as a journalist: science journalist especially. His _The Red Queen_ is standard reading in philosophy of science courses. Ridley’s books like _The Rational Optimist_ also stand as a counterbalance to the alarmism of the likes of the _Guardian_ ’s George Monbiot. Ridley is also a trenchant critic of statist bureacracies. When asked for his “dangerous idea”, he suggested: **“Government is the problem not the solution”**.



It’s no surprise, then, that Ridley has a low opinion of the World Health Organisation. So when **Dominic Raab** , Britain’s foreign secretary, suggests that the WHO should be at the forefront of an inquiry into the Xi virus, Ridley is not exactly enthusiastic.



This is a terrible idea. WHO is full of good people with good intentions, but as a body it has very serious questions to answer about its own conduct before we trust it with looking at that of others.



That’s putting it mildly. US **President** Trump has a better idea: [defund the WHO](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/04/09/where-are-the-globalists-now/). Let it wither and die.



 **After all, the WHO is almost as complicit in this pandemic as the ghastly Xi regime.**



There are three charges against WHO. First, it failed to prepare the world for a pandemic, spending the years since the Sars and ebola alarms talking more about climate change, obesity and tobacco[…]



Second, once the epidemic began in China, WHO downplayed its significance, tweeting as late as January 14 that “preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus”, when it had already been warned by the Taiwanese health authorities among others of strong evidence for medical staff in Wuhan becoming ill.



The Chinese government at this stage had known for weeks that the virus was spreading, probably person to person, yet WHO then sycophantically praised the Chinese government. “China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response,” said WHO’s director-general, **Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus** , a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, a country run by a repressive regime heavily dependent on China. “China is really good at keeping people alive,” echoed the assistant director-general, Bruce Aylward, on 3 March.



The WHO’s bootlicking of the Chinese communists should hardly be a surprise. They’re dancing to the tune of their paymasters.



China is a big funder of WHO and insists that Taiwan be excluded from the organisation since it does not recognise Taiwan’s existence as a separate country. Taiwan banned travel from China very early in the pandemic.



This is not the first time the WHO has abjectly failed the world which pours billions into its coffers.



The third charge against WHO is that it has failed before. When the ebola outbreak in West Africa that was to kill 11,000 people began in late 2013, on its own admission WHO hindered the fight against the virus, obsessed with not letting others find out what was happening. In April 2014, the charity **Medecins Sans Frontieres** announced that the outbreak was out of control. They were promptly slapped down by a WHO spokesman. Others tried again in June to alert WHO. It was not until August that WHO admitted the gravity of the situation.



So, the WHO couldn’t care less about deadly epidemics and panders to murderous communists. But it does have **some** priorities…



[A]t the height of the ebola epidemic, **Margaret Chan** , the then director-general wrote an article in which she called climate change the “defining issue of the 21st century[…]



WHO gives the impression it would rather reprimand rich countries for climate change or bad eating habits than worry about epidemics. It’s also a bit obsessed with celebrities.



So it’s in the image of its parent body, the UN.



Like the UN, the WHO should be defunded, kicked to the curb and abandoned by any and all nations committed to freedom and democracy.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s cabinet continued to take shape on Monday, as Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas earned approval to lead the Central Intelligence Agency and Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, cleared a key Senate hurdle to all but assure his own confirmation. Despite some shaky appearances from his nominees on Capitol Hill and often blistering Democratic opposition, Mr. Trump has thus far faced few meaningful obstacles in installing the team of his choice  —   aided by Senate Republicans who are eager to expedite the confirmation process. Mr. Tillerson had been the only nominee to attract notable doubts from within the Republican Senate majority, briefly imperiling his prospects amid concerns over his ties to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, during Mr. Tillerson’s tenure at Exxon Mobil. But on Monday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had emerged as a critical vote on Mr. Tillerson’s fate, announced his support. Mr. Rubio had sharply questioned Mr. Tillerson at a hearing this month, chastising him in a series of interrogations over Mr. Tillerson’s equivocating testimony on human rights issues. Mr. Rubio also had left open the possibility of opposing him on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Republicans hold a   majority. But in a statement posted to Facebook on Monday morning, Mr. Rubio said that despite his “reservations” about the pick, the president was “entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet. ” Several hours later, by a   vote of   Mr. Tillerson won the committee’s recommendation. As Mr. Rubio explained his vote to reporters after the hearing, a heckler sidled up beside him with a teasing prop: a model of a spine. Mr. Tillerson must still clear a full Senate vote in order to join the administration. Mr. Trump’s aides and Senate allies had hoped to win approval on several nominees on Inauguration Day, but only two national security posts  —   the defense secretary, James N. Mattis, and the homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly  —   were filled. On Monday, Mr. Pompeo joined them, with the Senate convening to approve his selection, 66 to 32, after a debate that stretched into the evening. In their bid to confirm cabinet picks quickly, Republicans have been hamstrung at times by lax preparation from Mr. Trump’s team and the sprawling financial holdings of many of his nominees, which have produced reams of ethics paperwork. Still, Democrats are powerless to stop any nominees on their own. They have sought to use the confirmation process as a showcase for what they call the extreme positions of the prospective Trump cabinet and the ethical lapses that have dogged some of his selections. “I know why our Republican colleagues want to rush these nominees through,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, who has taken to calling Mr. Trump’s team a “swamp cabinet. ” “We’re not stalling nominations,” he added. “This isn’t sport. This is serious stuff. ” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, urged Democrats to stand down. “Let’s join hands and move forward,” he said. Earlier, a group of Democratic senators formally requested a second hearing for Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, after an initial review of her ethics papers. They cited potential conflicts of interest and efforts by Republicans to limit questions at her hearing last week. Ms. DeVos struggled through the hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, appearing uncertain on some basics of federal education policy. In response to the Democrats’ letter, the office of Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the committee’s chairman, said there would be no second hearing, adding that Ms. DeVos had already spent more time and answered more questions than former President Barack Obama’s nominees for education secretary had. Ms. DeVos is scheduled for a committee vote next week. Several other nominees are expected to be considered by other Senate committees this week, clearing the path for their confirmations. They include Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump’s choice for attorney general Ben Carson, his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development Wilbur L. Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary and Elaine Chao, the nominee for transportation secretary. Hearings are scheduled on Tuesday for Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, his choice for White House budget director and Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the Small Business Administration. On Monday, the chamber’s focus was on Mr. Pompeo. Though Republicans had hoped to hold the vote just after the inauguration, some Democrats objected to what they viewed as an effort to curb debate on intelligence issues. “We ought to have a debate in broad daylight, not when senators are trying to figure out if their tux is going to fit,” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said at the time. Mr. Wyden continued his push on Monday, suggesting Mr. Pompeo’s record conveyed “enthusiasm for sweeping new surveillance programs targeting Americans,” among other concerns. But Mr. Pompeo did earn the support of some Democrats, limiting drama on the floor. The most highly anticipated vote of the day had been Mr. Rubio’s, on another Trump selection. With his explosive questioning of Mr. Tillerson at the hearing two weeks ago, the former 2016 presidential hopeful had once again seized an outsize spotlight. But Mr. Rubio also seemed to feed critics’ perception of him as squishy on matters of conviction, reinforcing his history of public vacillating and backtracking. He worked on immigration reform in 2013, before distancing himself from the legislation during last year’s Republican primaries. He sold “#NeverTrump” bumper stickers on his campaign website, before announcing his support for Mr. Trump once he dropped out. He said he would not run for   to the Senate, weeks before revealing a change of heart. “The only thing you can consistently count on when it comes to Marco Rubio is his capacity to cave,” said Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online publication. In his statement on Facebook, Mr. Rubio concluded with a warning: “Upcoming appointments to critical posts in the Department of State are not entitled to, and will not receive from me, the same level of deference I have given this nomination. ”"
"**Until recently, Hong Kong was considered a poster child in its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.**
Despite sharing a border with mainland China, where the first cases were reported, Hong Kong kept its infection numbers down and was able to avoid the extreme lockdown measures introduced in parts of China, Europe and the US.
But now, it's been hit by not even a second, but a third, wave of infections. The government has warned its hospital system could face collapse, and it's just had a record high number of new infections in a day.
What went wrong, and what lessons are there for countries juggling both the pandemic, and the economic pain caused by lockdown?
Hong Kong had its first Covid-19 cases in late January, leading to widespread concern and panic buying, but infection numbers remained relatively low and the spread was controlled quite quickly.
It experienced what became known as its ""second wave"" in March, after overseas students and residents started returning to the territory, leading to a spike in imported infections.
As a result, Hong Kong introduced strict border controls, banning all non-residents from entering its borders from overseas, and everyone who returned was required to undergo a Covid-19 test and 14-day quarantine.
It even used electronic bracelets to track new arrivals and make sure they stayed at home.
That, combined with the widespread use of masks and social distancing measures, worked - Hong Kong went for weeks without a locally transmitted case, and life seemed to be heading back to normal.
So how did the ""third wave"" - that has led to more than 100 new cases for nine days in a row - arrive?
""It's quite disappointing and frustrating because Hong Kong had really got things very much under control,"" says Malik Peiris, Chair of Virology at the University of Hong Kong.
He believes there were two flaws in the system.
First, many returnees opted to quarantine for 14 days at home - an arrangement that's common in many countries including the UK - rather than in quarantine camps.
""There is a weakness there because other people in the home are not under any form of restriction, and will still be coming and going,"" says Prof Peiris.
However, he believes the more serious problem came from the government's decision to exempt several groups of people from testing and quarantine when they entered Hong Kong.
Hong Kong had exempted about 200,000 people, including seafarers, aircrew and executives of companies listed on the stock exchange, from quarantine.
It said the exceptions were needed to ensure normal daily operations continued in Hong Kong, or because their travel was necessary to the city's economic development.
As an international city and trading port, Hong Kong has a high number of air links, and many ships change crews there. The territory also depends on imports from mainland China and elsewhere for food and essential goods.
Joseph Tsang, an infectious diseases specialist and doctor, describes the exemptions as a significant ""loophole"" that increased the risk of infection, particularly from seafarers and air crew who also visited tourist spots and used public transport.
The government initially said that the quarantine exemptions were not to blame, but later admitted there was evidence that the exemptions were behind the latest outbreak.
They have now tightened rules for air and sea crews - but it can be difficult to enforce. There was alarm earlier this week when a foreign pilot was reportedly spotted sightseeing while awaiting Covid-19 test results.
And balancing public health, practical concerns and the economy can be hard - a union representing pilots at FedEx has asked the company to stop flights to Hong Kong because it says the stricter Covid-19 measures, including mandatory hospital stays for pilots who test positive, create ""unacceptable conditions for pilots"".
Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, says Hong Kong's experience with quarantine problems could also happen in other countries.
""In the UK, you also have a 14-day quarantine at home, so you would have the same potential issue with leakage.""
Meanwhile, New Zealand and Australia have a mandatory hotel quarantine policy, which is ""a good conceptâ¦ although there's the issue of who pays for it"", he adds.
Like Hong Kong, the UK also exempts certain travellers from border rules, including drivers of goods vehicles, seafarers and aircrew.
Hong Kong's quarantine exemptions have been around for months, but the third wave didn't hit until July.
Prof Peiris believes this is because of a second crucial factor - social distancing measures were significantly rolled back in June.
""As long as social distancing measures were in place the system could cope - but once measures were relaxed"" the imported infections spread rapidly, he says. ""It's a lesson for everybody.""
Dr Tsang recalls that by late June the government had allowed public gatherings of up to 50 people, while there were celebrations for Fathers' Day and Hong Kong's handover anniversary.
""Many citizens were fatigued after months of social distancing, so when the government said things seemed fine and relaxed restrictions, they started meeting with friends and family.
""I think it's very unfortunate - many factors combined at the same time.""
However, Prof Peiris stresses that Hong Kongers had been ""extremely compliant"" with social distancing and hygiene measures during in the first and second waves - ""in fact, they were even a step ahead of government instructions, wearing face masks before they were compulsory.""
He believes the reintroduction of social distancing measures now are already having an effect, and hopes that Hong Kong will be back to close to zero local infections within four to six weeks.
At that point, he adds, the challenge will be to stop imported infections - particularly once social distancing measures are lifted.
It's a challenge other countries will also face once they are successful in containing the virus within their borders, because ""when you get to low levels of transmission within your population, having unregulated introductions from outside can lead to disaster.""
Many of Hong Kong's pandemic struggles will apply to other cities, but the territory has also experienced another crisis - a political one - over the past year.
On 1 July, thousands of people took part in a pro-democracy rally, despite the march being banned by authorities who said it broke social distancing guidelines. Hundreds of thousands also voted in opposition primaries in mid-July, despite the government warning that the primaries could breach a new security law.
Since then, Chinese state media have blamed both events for triggering the third wave of infections, while one politician called it ""absolutely irresponsible behaviour"".
However, health experts say there is no evidence of them causing the spike in infections.
Prof Cowling says scientists ""are able to link together cases to identify chains of transmission, and there are no clusters attributed to those events,"" while Prof Peiris argues that the events ""may have aggravated things slightly, but I don't think it was a major determinant one way or the other"".
Meanwhile, Dr Tsang says research has shown that ""the strain of coronavirus in the third wave is different from those in previous waves"" - in particular, it has type of mutation seen in aircrew and seafarers from the Philippines and Kazakhstan, so he believes the strain was imported.
There have been similar discussions around the world - particularly in light of anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd - over whether demonstrations can lead to a spike in infections, with some experts suggesting that outdoor events where participants wear masks and take precautions could be lower risk than initially expected.
There is widespread speculation that Hong Kong's government could postpone September's elections to Hong Kong's parliament - the Legislative Council - citing the spike in infections.
Several local media reports, quoting anonymous sources, say the government is set to postpone elections by a year.
Opposition politicians have accused the government of using the pandemic as an excuse to delay elections, especially as the opposition had performed strongly in local elections late last year.
However the move has been welcomed by some, including former Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang, who told local media: ""The government won't be able to absolve itself of blame if polling stations turn into hotbeds for spreading the virus.
""It's also nearly impossible for candidates to canvass votes given the social distancing rules.""
Prof Cowling says that social distancing measures reintroduced by the government have already stopped case numbers from accelerating over the past week.
""I'm not sure it's necessary to delay the elections - certainly not for a year. You could consider delaying them for two weeks or a month, because by then we'd almost certainly have [local infection] numbers back down to zero.""
He adds that there are many ways to make elections safer, including increasing the number of polling stations and staff to reduce wait times, ensuring polling stations are well-ventilated, and testing all polling station staff two days before the election.
Governments have taken very different approaches to this - at least 68 countries or territories postponed elections due to Covid-19, while 49 places held elections as planned, says the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.
Singapore held its general elections earlier this month - and had its highest turnout in recent years, says Eugene Tan, a law professor and political commentator at Singapore Management University.
""There is never a good time for an election during a pandemic,"" he says, but the vote went ahead with several safety measures in place and ""demonstrates that it is possible to protect public health even as people go about exercising their democratic right to vote.""
However, he believes that making a decision on whether to proceed with elections is a tough judgement call for governments, particularly if public trust is low.
""If you delay elections you could be accused of waiting for a more favourable time [for the government] - but if you go ahead you could be accused of playing fast and loose with people's lives. The worst thing would be to have an election, and then have a spike in the number of cases."""
"HOLTVILLE, Ala.  —   In an airy,   house here on Jordan Lake about 25 miles north of Montgomery and around the corner from cotton farms, there is a     television on the living room wall. The TV belongs to Myra and Raymond Turner, the parents of Kevin Turner, a former Alabama fullback who played eight seasons in the N. F. L. This Sunday, that TV will be tuned to the N. F. L. playoffs, to the game that killed their son. “I know a lot of people are going to say, ‘How do you watch football knowing football had taken your son’s own life? ’” Raymond Turner said. “But it’s hard to explain, really. It’s just all so hard to explain. ” I traveled to Alabama to hear an explanation and try to understand it  —   and maybe even understand why they allow their two teenage grandsons to play football after Kevin, the boys’ father, suffered for six long years with a brain disease that research has linked to head trauma in football. He died last March at 46. There was no clear answer to my question, only compartmentalized memories. In the house on the lake, which Kevin helped his parents buy, reminders of him appear at every turn. On the desk in his old bedroom is one of his Alabama playbooks in the rec room are seven of his jerseys, framed in the living room, there is his Philadelphia Eagles helmet and, of course, the giant   TV, which used to be his. Kevin, who played for the New England Patriots as well as the Eagles, died after being treated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as A. L. S. and Lou Gehrig’s disease. Kevin donated his brain to researchers in Boston who have examined the brains of more than 200 former football players after they died. The researchers said Kevin Turner’s brain was “riddled” with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C. T. E. which has been tied to repeated blows to the head. When watching Sunday’s playoff games, you probably won’t think about Turner. But you should. In a life that was shortened by football, he made a wide and lasting impact on the sport. After the diagnosis in 2010, Turner became one of the main plaintiffs in a   lawsuit former players brought against the N. F. L. claiming that the league hid the   cognitive dangers of the game. The league agreed to a settlement for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, and the first payouts from that litigation are expected in the coming months. Turner didn’t live to see a penny of that settlement money. The cash could have helped him when his body deteriorated and his family had to care for him. The Turners remember their son, who once weighed 235 pounds, dwindling to 100. At first, he lost strength in his left hand. And his left arm. Then his right arm and hand. Then his neck. His mother had to learn how to thicken water so he wouldn’t choke while drinking it, and how to clean his breathing and feeding tubes. By the end, Kevin couldn’t eat, drink, swallow or talk, as he fought for each breath. “It’s all been really hard,” Myra said, as she started to cry. “It’s worse than you can imagine, having to be a nurse to your son and then losing your only son. ” With the family’s cooperation, HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” has chronicled the six years of Kevin’s decline for a segment that will be televised on Tuesday. His parents think it is important to tell their story, to raise awareness about C. T. E. They take no offense at questions about why they haven’t turned their backs on football. They still watch. They just watch differently. They pay a lot more attention to college games than to the N. F. L. and they are always interested in seeing how officials treat a player who might have a concussion. They have tuned into the N. F. L. playoffs, and they plan to watch the Super Bowl. Neither is ignoring the risk of C. T. E. but Raymond said, “It’s probably too late for those guys in the N. F. L. ” As Myra Turner watched the Dallas Cowboys play the Packers last weekend, she saw a TV camera stop on the former Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith, who was celebrating and grabbing his seatmate, Tony Dorsett, another Cowboys alumnus. Dorsett, who has said he has memory loss and other signs of C. T. E. didn’t look right. “He didn’t even crack a smile,” Myra said. “He was just sitting there and I thought, ‘Wow, how can he sit there with no emotion at all?’ Then I realized, oh, yeah, I do know why. ’” The Turners grew up in this state, where football is king, a rite passed from fathers to sons. Raymond played, then coached Kevin. “I’m a guy, so I love football  —   the hitting, the running, the scoring, the girls,” Raymond said, before Myra cut him off. “And I was a cheerleader!” she said. “I was the only girl you’re talking about, right?” By their smiles and giggles, you could tell football once brought them unquestionable joy, long before anyone had heard of C. T. E.  —   or even took concussions seriously. Today, their granddaughter, Natalie, 16, is a cheerleader dating a football player, just as her grandmother did. Myra won’t watch her grandsons play. Raymond watches every game. Nolan was a redshirt freshman at Clemson last season. Cole plays in middle school. “Their dad told them to think long and hard before playing football because of what it could possibly do to their brains,” Raymond said. “But the boys wanted to play. The game is much safer. What can you do? We make sure they are extra careful. ” He said: “If the boys said they didn’t want to play football anymore, I’d be pretty happy about that. But Nolan is 19 and can make his own decisions now. I can’t convince him of anything. ” As the couple talked about their bittersweet relationship with football, Raymond twisted a napkin so many times and so tightly that it became a hard, tiny paper sculpture. Myra’s eyes filled with tears. “I can’t believe my son is gone,” she said. Kevin was buried last Easter in Prattville, Ala. about four miles from his high school football field, which is now named after him. On Thursday, his grave was marked with a small white metal cross and a vase of white artificial flowers, which had fallen onto its side. The squares of sod atop his plot had yet to grow together. His bronze grave marker  —   which will be finished any day now  —   will have his name, Paul Kevin Turner, and two etchings of him in a football uniform  —   one from his days at Alabama, the other from when he was with the Eagles. Between his dates of birth and death, there will be a raised image of a golden football. “I didn’t think twice about putting football on there,” Myra said. “Because that was his life, our life. ”"
"With hundreds of thousands of Americans forced to evacuate their homes in the western US, Donald Trump hasn’t said a word about the wildfires blazing across multiple states in nearly three weeks.  But some national Democratic leaders also have been slow to call attention to the fires in California, Oregon and Washington which have killed more than 20, forced millions to breathe ash from orange-tinted skies that are blocking out the sun, and seen hundreds of thousands of people flee their homes. Climate activists say the tepid political response, particularly from the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is yet another sign that US politicians are far from ready to take concrete steps to deal with the realities of climate change, let alone write laws to stop burning fossil fuels in order to slow its effects. Another four years of Trump in office would devastate the international climate movement, but even a Democratic-controlled government is not guaranteed to substantially address the crisis. Last week, Pelosi barely mentioned the fires, which are ravaging her own home state of California, until Thursday, when she was asked about them on MSNBC and in a weekly press conference. In a 17-minute update for reporters, she spoke of the fires – which are being made worse by human-induced climate change – just briefly before speaking at length about what she sees as Republicans’ failed response to the coronavirus . When asked if Democrats would pursue major climate change legislation immediately if they win control of Congress and the White House, Pelosi gave a jumbled answer. “Well, we will have … we will have, obviously, hopefully, the Covid pandemic will have subsided – if there’s any thought that the Republicans in Congress will pay attention to science,” she said. “Right now they’re in a place where they don’t believe in science and they don’t like governance. So they don’t want any reason to have to govern, to call for standards to defeat the virus … but the virus, of course – in other words, to open up our schools and our economy – has to be first and foremost. But yes, it will be an early part of the agenda.” Pelosi added that climate change has long been her “flagship issue”, spoke of a 2005 energy law she helped pass, and noted House Democrats have drafted a climate report. Pelosi’s spokesman, Henry Connelly, pointed to Pelosi’s comments about the wildfires and climate change in interviews and press conferences two weeks ago, on 26 and 27 August. He said under her leadership the House had made it a priority to pass climate-focused legislation and noted she was convening the heads of parliament of G7 nations this weekend on the climate crisis and economic and environmental justice. However, Pelosi has previously mocked the Green New Deal – a progressive proposal for large-scale spending to fight inequity and the climate crisis simultaneously – calling it the “green dream”. So has Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democratic senator for California, who last year told children who came to her office to ask her to commit to a Green New Deal that she disagreed with the plan, including because there was “no way to pay for it”. Feinstein, in a recent op-ed, linked the more intense fires to climate change and called for policy changes to help communities prepare for and fight fires. But she did not write about any policies to halt rising emissions. “You look up at the sky and you wonder. It’s not just the Republicans who are letting us down. It’s the Democrats who aren’t fighting for a better climate future either,” said Rebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant and founder of New Deal Strategies. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that climate delaying is the same as climate denial. And it’s hard not to see that point crystal clear on a morning like today.” Joe Biden has a $2tn plan to try to virtually eliminate climate emissions by 2050, but he reiterates frequently that he would not try to ban fracking – the process that has fueled a gas drilling boom in the US. In doing so, he has earned the support of some reticent labor unions. “The Biden campaign understands that a full embrace of an aggressive climate change agenda could create problems for them in the upper midwest,” said Dan Schnur, who served as an adviser to the former California governor Pete Wilson and Arizona senator John McCain. “Trump has shown no desire to talk about California beyond using it as a liberal punching bag to make his case to his conservative base.” On Thursday, Biden’s campaign tweeted a video of the destruction and said: “Make no mistake: climate change is already here – and we’re witnessing its devastating effects every single day. “We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is.” Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for Kamala Harris, said Biden and Harris “have been closely monitoring the wildfires raging across the state and highlighting the urgent need to address the threat of climate change”. Barack Obama also tweeted photos of a glowing, smoke-filled San Francisco and told followers to “vote like your life depends on it – because it does”. That’s compared to Trump, who has held 46 public events since 23 August where he could have addressed the wildfires but did not, according to a review by the group Climate Power 2020. Asked why he has not done so, the White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was “closely monitoring” the fires and had sent federal funding and personnel to help states fight them. Deere flagged a tweet noting Trump spoke with California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, to “express his condolences for the loss of life and reiterate the administration’s full support to help those on the frontlines of the fires”. The high-profile Democratic nods to the climate crisis are an improvement over just years ago, when the issue was barely touched upon in presidential debates. Yet activists say it is not enough. The planet is already 1C hotter than before industrialization. It is on track to become at least 3C hotter. The wildfire season is expanding, and climate-fueled drought is making the fires more dangerous. Stronger hurricanes are ripping apart Gulf coast communities. Iowa and other midwest states are still reeling from a derecho. “It’s unfortunate, given that the speaker’s own district is being impacted by what’s going on right now,” said Anthony Rogers-Wright, policy coordinator of the Climate Justice Alliance. “There are far too many in Democratic leadership who believe that climate change is a wedge issue. When what it really is is an issue that if articulated correctly could bring everyone together.” On Thursday, the Climate Justice Alliance joined “a coalition of grassroots groups, labor unions, Black, Brown and Indigenous leaders” to back a congressional resolution aimed at “creating nearly 16m good jobs, reviving our economy, and addressing the interlocking crises of climate change, racial injustice, public health, and economic inequity”. Without saying the words “Green New Deal”, the measure’s goals are closely aligned. The resolution has sponsors from across the Democrat political spectrum: senators Chuck Schumer, Ed Markey, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren; and Representatives Deb Haaland, Debbie Dingell, Donald McEachin, Sheila Jackson Lee, Raul Grijalva, Rosa DeLauro, Brendan Boyle, Barbara Lee, Ilhan Omar and Ro Khanna. In a virtual press conference on Thursday, the Democratic senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon spoke of the “almost apocalyptic moment” in his state. He blamed an influx of “dark money” from the fossil fuel industry in political campaigns, saying their contributions brought the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to power. “We are seeing the regular arrival of larger, more intense disasters that are absolutely consistent with what happens when you have a warmer planet,” Merkley said. “We have to now translate that into a determined, hopefully bipartisan, effort to have a bold, massive undertaking to address it.”"
"A decade ago, the writer and scientist James Lovelock despaired that the main obstruction to meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency was democracy itself. “Even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must be put on hold for the time being,” he told this newspaper. “I have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while”. China’s claim to leadership in global green debates is rooted in the idea that only enlightened dictators can take a long view, overcome entrenched interests and force the required changes in societies. However, eco-authoritarians see democracy through a glass, darkly. Dealing with humanity’s impact on the planet is not a war to be ended in a decisive victory. It is a constant struggle of adaptation and mitigation. The route lies not in suspending democracy but enhancing it. Time is short. Even reducing greenhouse gas emissions as fast as possible, we can barely keep temperatures below dangerous limits. The moment urgently requires the public to be instilled with a commitment to ecological values and a desire to act in the face of an existential challenge. That is why the UK’s first climate assembly is so important. It involved a group of 100 or so randomly selected UK citizens meeting and discussing with experts how the country should reach net zero emissions by 2050.  Significantly, the group was chosen to be representative of the public – 17% of participants were climate sceptics. The experiment showed that, given time, guidance and plenty of breathing space, ordinary people could get to grips with tough political questions and reach intelligent decisions. The recommendations from the climate assembly, published this week, were radical and plausible. It backed taxing polluters, state ownership to roll out green technology, and bans on climate-unfriendly consumer goods such as petrol cars and gas boilers. These are all good ideas that need attention, particularly from Boris Johnson’s administration, which, as the Institute for Government warns, has no plan to reach its own net zero climate target despite having written it into law last year. With a political leadership that crows about reneging on international deals, it is hard to see how the UK can play a leading role in global initiatives in the run-up to next year’s UN climate talks in Glasgow. As the atmosphere heats up, the climate is changing. The 10 warmest years in Britain since 1884 have occurred since 2002. Sunbathing in February feels like a canary in the climate coal mine. On the other side of the world, a series of environmental disasters have cascaded into each other, leaving a Californian dystopia smothered in toxic dust from forest fires. There’s an argument to say that the climate assembly played it safe and that it failed to get to grips with the spectacularly profitable industries which are founded on a fundamental climate injustice. That may be true. But the assembly presents a political foil to the prime minister. Mr Johnson’s shtick is to persuade people with hot feelings rather than hard facts, knowing that emotions shape an evaluation of rational argument. Whenever he is in trouble, he returns to this form of politics. Democracy must be about respectful discussion, not just voting. The climate assembly was set up by six parliamentary select committees in response to demands from the green campaign group Extinction Rebellion, which regrettably rejected its recommendations as “too timid”. Parliamentary sovereignty needs to be better grounded in the people and buttressed by deliberative debate. We need to slow down and understand more. Politics is becoming so complex, fast-paced and data-laden that voters facing difficult choices with little warning increasingly have to resort to rules of thumb to form their responses. Mr Johnson often counterfeits or misrepresents the evidence that cues these reactions, to harden positions and define compromise as defeat. With the climate emergency upon us, we need institutions like citizens’ assemblies, and a politics of mutual respect that can focus on insights and evidence to fit people together rather than pull them apart."
"When it comes to survival, it’s the local climate that matters most for the meadow pipit. Even if the broad scale climate warms significantly, meadow pipits will cling on for longer than previously thought, seeking out pockets in the landscape, such as the shady side of a hill, where they can still find food and shelter. Meadow pipits are small brown and buff songbirds with a distinctive high and piping call. They are widespread across the British uplands, but have been declining since the mid 1970s, and are now on the global red list of birds and classified as “near threatened”. Their penchant for craneflies means they rely on the cool, damp places where craneflies abound; places that may become scarce as climate warms and drys.  Using climate and meadow pipit data from the UK, scientists modelled how meadow pipits are likely to fare as climate changes. Their results, published in Landscape Ecology, clearly show that microclimates can provide refuges in largely inhospitable areas, buffering some of the most extreme impacts of climate change. Temperature can vary by as much as 20C between the shady and the exposed side of a hill, and focusing conservation efforts on these climate refuges will help to give meadow pipits the best chance. "

"For years, those on the left in Britain have been arguing that the government should be more aggressive in its use of state aid to revitalise those parts of the country affected by industrial blight. Now, at last, we have ministers prepared to have a bare-knuckled fight with the EU over their right to intervene on behalf of those living where the factories and the coalmines used to be, but they grew up as disciples of Margaret Thatcher, who insisted that tough state aid rules be included in the rules for the single market. Ah the irony of it! In the past six months Boris Johnson’s economic policy has owed more to Tony Benn’s alternative economic strategy than to free-market principles. A willingness to nationalise failing industries? Check. A bigger role for the state? Check. Help for businesses contingent on them agreeing to rules of conduct set by the government? Check. Treasury-backed loans to struggling companies? Check. A decade of austerity to repair the damage caused to the public finances? Forget it. Johnson has actually gone even further than Benn suggested in the 1970s and early 1980s. The AES did not suggest that the state should have the right to tell a family of five that they couldn’t invite two grandparents round for tea. It was all about intervention in the workplace, not telling people what they could do in their own homes. Governments everywhere are questioning whether globalisation is all it is cracked up to be The UK is by no means unique. At the end of August, Jerome Powell, the man who runs the US central bank, made it clear that controlling inflation would play second fiddle to securing full employment for all Americans. Governments everywhere are assessing their vulnerability to long supply chains and questioning whether globalisation is all it is cracked up to be. The rich are getting nervous that they will be hit with wealth taxes. So what’s going on here? Well, since the 1970s the management of economies has been guided by a number of core principles: allow market forces to work; enshrine low inflation as the key objective of policy; reduce the power of the state; keep taxes as low as possible; remove power from elected politicians and hand it to technocrats; keep borders open. Some called it neoliberalism. Others dubbed it the Washington consensus. These principles survived the first crisis of the 21st century – the financial crash of 2008 – but not the second. A global pandemic has forced governments – no matter where they come from on the political spectrum – to intervene in ways completely unprecedented in peacetime. Some governments have made a better fist of it than others. Free-marketeers in the UK say that it is a good job Johnson’s government – given its record on providing personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing – was not responsible for keeping the supermarket shelves stocked with food or we would have all starved. They have a point. That said, times have clearly changed. Last week, Gordon Brown said the constitution of the Bank of England should be changed so that it was obliged to pay as much attention to jobs as to inflation. This is the same Gordon Brown who in 1997 gave the Bank its independence in the first place. John McDonnell, who was shadow chancellor when Jeremy Corbyn led the Labour party, is calling for a green Marshall Plan that would pull the economy out of its slump by investing in decarbonisation projects. “As we deal with the Covid pandemic crisis we must not lose sight of the existential crisis of climate change that we also face,” he said. McDonnell was making the same argument during last year’s general election campaign but nobody was really listening then. Now they are. The International Monetary Fund is calling for a green, inclusive recovery. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will next week publish a report written by one of Brown’s former special advisers, Michael Jacobs, on behalf of an advisory panel including the chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane; Robert Skidelsky, the biographer of Keynes; and Mariana Mazzucato, a professor at University College London. The report will call for policymaking to be based around four objectives: environmental sustainability; rising wellbeing (rather than simply higher incomes); lower levels of inequality; and more resilient economies. It goes without saying that some new thinking is needed – and long overdue because since 2008 the world has experienced a near meltdown of the financial system, two severe recessions, a decade of flatlining productivity and an ever-rising threat from global heating. So what happens next? One option is to try to put the genie back in the bottle, which is what happened after the 2008 financial crash. But that didn’t work either, economically or politically. Austerity slowed growth and made voters angry. There is no appetite for another dose of the same, even on the right. As Brown says, they don’t even believe in the Washington consensus in Washington these days. A second option would be for policymakers to recognise the need to keep supporting their economies for as long as it takes to bring unemployment down to pre-crisis levels and avoid deflation, while at the same time persisting with structural reforms. This, broadly, is what Shinzo Abe, who recently stepped down as Japan’s prime minister, tried for eight years with little success. The alternative is to harness the best of the market – its ability to adapt and innovate – with the power of the state in order to bring about economic transformation of the sort Jacobs is suggesting. Carefully nurturing the technologies and industries of the future needs to be part of that mix. The question for the UK is whether it learns from its multiple crises or is overwhelmed by them."

‘Hockey Stick’ Temperature Graphs


Now Updated: 300 Non-Hockey Stick Graphs

“[W]hen it comes to disentangling natural variability from anthropogenically affected variability the vast majority of the instrumental record may be biased.”  — Büntgen et al., 2017


Last year there were at least 60 peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals demonstrating that Today’s Warming Isn’t Global, Unprecedented, Or Remarkable.
 .
Just within the last 5 months, 58 more papers and 80 new graphs have been published that continue to undermine the popularized conception of a slowly cooling Earth temperature history followed by a dramatic hockey-stick-shaped uptick, or an especially unusual global-scale warming during modern times.
.
Yes, some regions of the Earth have been warming in recent decades or at some point in the last 100 years.  Some regions have been cooling for decades at a time.  And many regions have shown no significant net changes or trends in either direction relative to the last few hundred to thousands of years.
 .
Succinctly, then, scientists publishing in peer-reviewed journals have increasingly affirmed that there is nothing historically unprecedented or remarkable about today’s climate when viewed in the context of long-term natural variability.







Büntgen et al., 2017
“Spanning the period 1186-2014 CE, the new reconstruction reveals overall warmer conditions around 1200 and 1400, and again after ~1850.
Little agreement is found with climate model simulations that consistently overestimate recent summer warming and underestimate pre-industrial temperature changes. … [W]hen it comes to disentangling natural variability from anthropogenically affected variability the vast majority of the instrumental record may be biased.






Parker and Ollier, 2017
“The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) v2 temperature time series (GISS Surface Temperature Analysis, 2012) in Alice Spring and all the 36 other stations located in a circle of 1,000 km from Alice Spring do not show any warming. There are stations covering different time windows having very close patterns of temperatures. In this circle of 3,141,593 km2 (roughly 50% of Australia) that is mostly underdeveloped, none of the stations […] has a warming trend.  … It is therefore only an artefact by BOM to produce the warming. Homogenization is supposed to be used to account for upwards biases such as Urban Heat Island, not to introduce upwards biases.  …  In the centre of Australia, all the stations available in a circle of radius 1,000 km were showing very little or no warming, as still acknowledged in the GHCN v2 data set up to October 2011 (Fig. 6). … Table 1 presents the warming trend for the 30 longest temperature records of Australia collected in a single location, with measurements started before 1900 and continued until after 1985.  … In the 30 locations, the monthly mean maximum temperature is warming 0.0004°C/year, or 0.04°C/century. That means there is no change within the limits of accuracy of the measurements. … The climate trend maps compiled by Bureau of Meteorology in their climate change section are completely unreliable, as the alleged increasing temperature is obtained by lowering temperatures of the past by “adjustments”. The longest of the Australian temperature records that were considered the most reliable by Bureau of Meteorology on February 2009 (BOM 2009) are still available as raw temperatures in the climate data online section and consistently show no warming and no increased extreme events within the limit of accuracy of measurements.”




Gennaretti et al., 2017


Abrantes et al., 2017
“The transition from warm to colder climatic conditions occurs around 1300 CE associated with the Wolf solar minimum. The coldest SSTs are detected between 1350 and 1850 CE, on Iberia during the well-known Little Ice Age (LIA) (Bradley and Jones, 1993), with the most intense cooling episodes related with other solar minima events, and major volcanic forcing and separated by intervals of relative warmth (e.g. (Crowley and Unterman, 2013; Solanki et al., 2004; Steinhilber et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2016; Usoskin et al., 2011). During the 20th century, the southern records show unusually large decadal scale SST oscillations in the context of the last 2 millennia, in particular after the mid 1970’s, within the Great Solar Maximum (1940 – 2000 (Usoskin et al., 2011)) and the “greater salinity anomaly” event in the northern Atlantic (Dickson et al., 1988), or yet the higher global temperatures of the last 1.4 ky detected by (Ahmed et al., 2013).”





Werner et al., 2017


Deng et al., 2017
“The results indicate that the climate of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, AD 900–1300) was similar to that of the Current Warm Period (CWP, AD 1850–present) … As for the Little Ice Age (LIA, AD 1550–1850), the results from this study, together with previous data from the Makassar Strait, indicate a cold and wet period compared with the CWP and the MCA in the western Pacific. The cold LIA period agrees with the timing of the Maunder sunspot minimum and is therefore associated with low solar activity.”


Chapanov et al., 2017
“A good agreement exists between the decadal cycles of LOD [length of day], MSL [mean sea level], climate and solar indices whose periods are between 12-13, 14-16, 16-18 and 28-33 years.”


Williams et al., 2017
“Reconstructed SSTs significantly warmed 1.1°C … from 1660s to 1800 (rate of change: 0.008°C/year), followed by a significant cooling of 0.8°C …  until 1840 (rate of change: 0.02°C/year), then a significant warming of 0.8°C from 1860 until the end of reconstruction in 2007 (rate of change: 0.005°C/year).” [The amplitude of sea surface temperature warming and cooling was higher and more rapid from the 1660s to 1800 than from 1860-2007.]
‘In fact, the SST reconstruction significantly co-varied with a reconstruction of solar irradiance [Lean, 2000] on the 11-year periodicity only from ~1745 to 1825. In addition, the reconstructed SSTs were cool during the period of lower than usual solar irradiance called the Maunder minimum (1645–1715) but then warmed and cooled during the Dalton minimum (1795–1830), a second period of reduced solar irradiance. … The Dalton solar minimum and increased volcanic activity in the early 1800s could explain the decreasing SSTs from 1800 to 1850.”


Stenni et al., 2017
“A recent effort to characterize Antarctic and sub-Antarctic climate variability during the last 200 years also concluded that most of the trends observed since satellite climate monitoring began in 1979 CE cannot yet be distinguished from natural (unforced) climate variability (Jones et al., 2016), and are of the opposite sign [cooling, not warming] to those produced by most forced climate model simulations over the same post-1979 CE interval. … (1) Temperatures over the Antarctic continent show an overall cooling trend during the period from 0 to 1900CE, which appears strongest in West Antarctica, and (2) no continent-scale warming of Antarctic temperature is evident in the last century.”

Kobashi et al., 2017
“After the 8.2 ka event, Greenland temperature reached the Holocene thermal maximum with the warmest decades occurring during the Holocene (2.9 ± 1.4 °C warmer than the recent decades) at 7960 ± 30 years B.P. … For the most recent 10 years (2005 to 2015), apart from the anomalously warm year of 2010, mean annual temperatures at the Summit exhibit a slightly decreasing trend in accordance with northern North Atlantic-wide cooling. The Summit temperatures are well correlated with southwest coastal records (Ilulissat, Kangerlussuaq, Nuuk, and Qaqortoq).”

Li et al., 2017
“The main driving forces behind the Holocene climatic changes in the LYR [Lower Yangtze Region, East China] area are likely summer solar insolation associated with tropical or subtropical macro-scale climatic circulations such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).”


Larsen et al., 2017
“[K]nowledge remains sparse of GICs [glaciers and ice caps] fluctuations in Greenland and whether they survived past warmer conditions than today, e.g. the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) ~8-5 cal. ka BP and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) ~1200-950 C.E. Only a few available studies have provided continuous records of Holocene glacier fluctuations in east Greenland (Lowell et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2014; Balascio et al., 2015) and west Greenland (Schweinsberg et al., 2017). These records show that local GICs [glaciers and ice caps] were significantly reduced and most likely completely absent during the HTM [Holocene Thermal Maximum].”


Zywiec et al., 2017


Ogurtsov et al., 2017
“Our analyses reveal appreciable and stable positive correlation between summer temperatures in Northern Fennoscandia and sea surface temperature in North Atlantic over AD 1567–1986. Thus a connection between climates of Northern Fennoscandia and North Atlantic basin is established for more than the last four centuries. Significant correlation was found between SST [sea surface temperatures] in NA [the North Atlantic] and solar activity (both instrumental data and proxies) during AD 1716–1986. … Thus, the connection between Northern Fennoscandian climate and solar activity, which has been previously established at century-scale (Ogurtsov et al., 2001, 2002, 2013) and millennial-scale (Helama et al., 2010), is confirmed for AD 1716–1986 over the entire frequency range using unfiltered records (with the exception for AMO reconstruction after Mann et al. (2009)).”


Arppe et al., 2017
“The highest δ18O [temperature proxy] value of the record occurs at ca. 1900–1800 cal. yr BP (~50–150 CE), coinciding with a period of general warmth referred to as the Roman Warm Period (RWP). In the North Atlantic Ocean, the RWP interval (ca. 2500–1500 cal. yr BP) is associated with, for example, increased temperatures and productivity, decreased evidence of ice … Northern Hemisphere terrestrial environments widely display evidence of elevated temperatures between 1 and 300 CE (Ljungqvist, 2010). … southern Spitsbergen experienced a significant late-Holocene cold spell prior to the onset of the LIA [Little Ice Age]. These negative shifts overlap with the latter part of a cooling known as the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP, ca. 1500–1000 cal. yr BP; Bianchi and McCave, 1999; McDermott et al., 2001). The event is directly preceded by a minimum in total solar irradiation (Renssen et al., 2006; Steinhilber et al., 2009) … A wealth of proxy evidence testifies to the LIA [Little Ice Age] cooling, thought to have been triggered by reduced solar irradiance, extended volcanism, and internal characteristics of the ocean–atmosphere system (Miller et al., 2010, 2012; Wanner et al., 2011). … Factoring in respective age-model uncertainties, it appears that all major negative shifts, that is, ‘cold’ periods, in the δ18Olw record are roughly synchronous with periods of major negative anomalies in total solar irradiation and high modeled probabilities for extremely cold years in the Nordic Seas (Renssen et al., 2006), and widespread evidence of North Atlantic ‘cold spells’ (Bond et al., 2001; Sarnthein et al., 2003; Solomina et al., 2015; Wanner et al., 2008) linked to solar forcing.”


Mayewski et al., 2017


Rydval et al., 2017
“[T]he recent summer-time warming in Scotland is likely not unique when compared to multi-decadal warm periods observed in the 1300s, 1500s, and 1730s“







Reynolds et al., 2017


Rosenthal et al., 2017
“Here we review proxy records of intermediate water temperatures from sediment cores and corals in the equatorial Pacific and northeastern Atlantic Oceans, spanning 10,000 years beyond the instrumental record. These records suggests that intermediate waters [0-700 m] were 1.5-2°C warmer during the Holocene Thermal Maximum than in the last century. Intermediate water masses cooled by 0.9°C from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age. These changes are significantly larger than the temperature anomalies documented in the instrumental record. The implied large perturbations in OHC and Earth’s energy budget are at odds with very small radiative forcing anomalies throughout the Holocene and Common Era. … The records suggest that dynamic processes provide an efficient mechanism to amplify small changes in insolation [surface solar radiation] into relatively large changes in OHC.”







Li et al., 2017
“We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations in NC [North China] during the last 22 centuries, with its quasi ∼100, 50, 23, or 22-year periodicity clearly identified in our climatic reconstructions. … It has been widely suggested from both climate modeling and observation data that solar activity plays a key role in driving late Holocene climatic fluctuations by triggering global temperature variability and atmospheric dynamical circulation“

“2003– 2009 was the warmest period in the reconstruction. 1970– 2000 was colder than the last stage of the Little Ice Age (LIA).”


Köse et al., 2017
“The reconstruction is punctuated by a temperature increase during the 20th century; yet extreme cold and warm events during the 19th century seem to eclipse conditions during the 20th century. We found significant correlations between our March–April spring temperature reconstruction and existing gridded spring temperature reconstructions for Europe over Turkey and southeastern Europe. … During the last 200 years, our reconstruction suggests that the coldest year was 1898 and the warmest year was 1873. The reconstructed extreme events also coincided with accounts from historical records. …  Further, the warming trends seen in our record agrees with data presented by Turkes and Sumer (2004), of which they attributed [20th century warming] to increased urbanization in Turkey.”



Flannery et al., 2017
“The early part of the reconstruction (1733–1850) coincides with the end of the Little Ice Age, and exhibits 3 of the 4 coolest decadal excursions in the record. However, the mean SST estimate from that interval during the LIA is not significantly different from the late 20th Century SST mean. The most prominent cooling event in the 20th Century is a decade centered around 1965. This corresponds to a basin-wide cooling in the North Atlantic and cool phase of the AMO.”


Steiger et al., 2017
“Through several idealized and real proxy experiments we assess the spatial and temporal extent to which isotope records can reconstruct surface temperature, 500 hPa geopotential height, and precipitation. We find local reconstruction skill to be most robust across the reconstructions, particularly for temperature and geopotential height, as well as limited non-local skill in the tropics.  These results are in agreement with long-held views that isotopes in ice cores have clear value as local climate proxies, particularly for temperature and atmospheric circulation.”

“Shallow marine molluscs that are today extinct close to Svalbard, because of the cold climate, are found in deposits there dating to the early Holocene. The most warmth-demanding species found, Zirfaea crispata, currently has a northern limit 1000 km farther south, indicating that August temperatures on Svalbard were 6°C warmer at around 10.2–9.2 cal. ka BP, when this species lived there. … After 8.2 cal. ka, the climate around Svalbard warmed again, and although it did not reach the same peak in temperatures as prior to 9 ka, it was nevertheless some 4°C warmer than present between 8.2 and 6 cal. ka BP. Thereafter, a gradual cooling brought temperatures to the present level at about 4.5 cal. ka BP. The warm early-Holocene climate around Svalbard was driven primarily by higher insolation and greater influx of warm Atlantic Water, but feedback processes further influenced the regional climate.”


Lasher et al., 2017
“This paper presents a multi proxy lake record of NW Greenland Holocene climate. … Summer temperatures (2.5–4 °C warmer than present) persisted until ∼4 ka [4,000 years ago] … Continual cooling after 4 ka led to coldest temperatures after 1.2 ka, with temperature anomalies 2-3°C below present.  Approximately 1000 km to the south, a 2-3°C July temperature anomaly (relative to [warmer than] present) between 6 and 5 ka was reported based upon chironomid assemblages near Illulisat and Jakobshavn (Axford et al., 2013). Across Baffin Bay on northeastern Baffin Island, HTM summer temperatures were an estimated ~5°C warmer than the pre-industrial late Holocene and 3.5°C warmer than present, based upon chironomid assemblages (Axford et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2007). … Following deglaciation, the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] retreated behind its present margins (by as much as 20-60 km in some parts of Greenland) during the HTM [Holocene Thermal Maximum] (Larsen et al., 2015; Young and Briner, 2015).”

Chang et al., 2017
“The chironomid-based record from Heihai Lake shows a summer temperature fluctuation within 2.4°C in the last c. 5000 years from the south-east margin of the QTP [Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau]. … The summer temperature changes in this region respond primarily to the variation in the Asian Summer Monsoon. The variability of solar activity is likely an important driver of summer temperatures, either directly or by modifying the strength and intensity of the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon. … We observed a relatively long-lasting summer cooling episode (c. 0.8°C lower than the 5000-year average) between c. 270 cal. BP and AD c. 1956. … The record shows cooling episodes occurred at c. 3100, 2600, 2100 and 1600 cal. BP.  This is likely related to the period defined as the Northern Hemisphere Little Ice Age (LIA; c. AD 1350–1850, equivalent to 600–100 cal. BP). These possibly relate to the 500-year quasi-periodic solar cycle. Cooling stages between c. 270 and 100 cal. BP were also recorded and these are possibly linked to the LIA suggesting a hemisphere-wide forcing mechanism for this event.”

Albot, 2017
“Growing paleoclimatic evidence suggests that the climatic signals of Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age events can be detected around the world (Mayewski et al., 2004; Bertler et al., 2011). … [T]he causes for these events are still debated between changes in solar output, increased volcanic activity, shifts in zonal wind distribution, and changes in the meridional overturning circulation (Crowley, 2000; Hunt, 2006).”

“Overall, the strong linkage between solar variability and summer SSTs is not only of regional significance, but is also consistent over the entire North Atlantic region.”

Woodson et al., 2017
“The last ca. 1000 years recorded the warmest SST averaging 28.5°C. We record, for the first time in this region, a cool interval, ca. 1000 years in duration, centered on 5000 cal years BP concomitant with a wet period recorded in Borneo. The record also reflects a warm interval from ca. 1000 to 500 cal years BP that may represent the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Variations in the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and solar activity are considered as potential drivers of SST trends. However, hydrology changes related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, ~ shifts of the Western Pacific Warm Pool and migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone are more likely to have impacted our SST temporal trend. …  The SA [solar activity] trends (Steinhilber et al., 2012) are in general agreement with the regional cooling of SST (Linsley et al., 2010) and the SA [solar activity] oscillations are roughly coincident with the major excursions in our SST data.”


Koutsodendris et al., 2017
“Representing one of the strongest global climate instabilities during the Holocene, the Little Ice Age (LIA) is marked by a multicentennial-long cooling (14-19th centuries AD) that preceded the recent ‘global warming’ of the 20th century. The cooling has been predominantly attributed to reduced solar activity and was particularly pronounced during the 1645-1715 AD and 1790-1830 AD solar minima, which are known as Maunder and Dalton Minima, respectively.”


Browne et al., 2017

Kawahata et al., 2017
“The SST [sea surface temperature] shows a broad maximum (~17.3 °C) in the mid-Holocene (5-7 cal kyr BP), which corresponds to the Jomon transgression. … The SST maximum continued for only a century and then the SST [sea surface temperatures] dropped by 3.5 °C [15.1 to 11.6 °C] within two centuries. Several peaks fluctuate by 2°C over a few centuries.”

Dechnik et al., 2017


Wu et al., 2017


Sun et al., 2017
“Our findings are generally consistent with other records from the ISM [Indian Summer Monsoon]  region, and suggest that the monsoon intensity is primarily controlled by solar irradiance on a centennial time scale. This external forcing may have been amplified by cooling events in the North Atlantic and by ENSO activity in the eastern tropical Pacific, which shifted the ITCZ further southwards.”


Wu et al., 2017
“The existence of depressed MAAT [mean annual temperatures] (1.3°C lower than the 3200-year average) between 1480 CE and 1860 CE (470–90 cal. yr BP) may reflect the manifestation of the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) in southern Costa Rica. Evidence of low-latitude cooling and drought during the ‘LIA’ has been documented at several sites in the circum-Caribbean and from the tropical Andes, where ice cores suggest marked cooling between 1400 CE and 1900 CE.  Lake and marine records recovered from study sites in the southern hemisphere also indicate the occurrence of ‘LIA’ cooling. High atmospheric aerosol concentrations, resulting from several large volcanic eruptions and sea-ice/ocean feedbacks, have been implicated as the drivers responsible for the ‘LIA’.”


Park, 2017
“Late Holocene climate change in coastal East Asia was likely driven by ENSO variation.   Our tree pollen index of warmness (TPIW) shows important late Holocene cold events associated with low sunspot periods such as Oort, Wolf, Spörer, and Maunder Minimum. Comparisons among standard Z-scores of filtered TPIW, ΔTSI, and other paleoclimate records from central and northeastern China, off the coast of northern Japan, southern Philippines, and Peru all demonstrate significant relationships [between solar activity and climate]. This suggests that solar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).”

Dong et al., 2017


Nazarova et al., 2017
“The application of transfer functions resulted in reconstructed T July fluctuations of approximately 3 °C over the last 2800 years. Low temperatures (11.0-12.0 °C) were reconstructed for the periods between ca 1700 and 1500 cal yr BP (corresponding to the Kofun cold stage) and between ca 1200 and 150 cal yr BP (partly corresponding to the Little Ice Age [LIA]). Warm periods (modern T[emperatures] July or higher) were reconstructed for the periods between ca 2700 and 1800 cal yr BP, 1500 and 1300 cal yr BP and after 150 cal yr BP.”


Samartin et al., 2017


Thienemann et al., 2017
“[P]roxy-inferred annual MATs[annual mean air temperatures] show the lowest value at 11,510 yr BP (7.6°C). Subsequently, temperatures rise to 10.7°C at 9540 yr BP followed by an overall decline of about 2.5°C until present (8.3°C).”


Li et al., 2017
“Contrary to the often-documented warming trend over the past few centuries, but consistent with temperature record from the northern Tibetan Plateau, our data show a gradual decreasing trend of 0.3 °C in mean annual air temperature from 1750 to 1970 CE. This result suggests a gradual cooling trend in some high altitude regions over this interval, which could provide a new explanation for the observed decreasing Asian summer monsoon. In addition, our data indicate an abruptly increased interannual-to decadal-scale temperature variations of 0.8 – 2.2 °C after 1970 CE, in terms of both magnitude and frequency, indicating that the climate system in high altitude regions would become more unstable under current global warming.”


Krawczyk et al., 2017




Pendea et al., 2017  (Russia)
“The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) was a relatively warm period that is commonly associated with the orbitally forced Holocene maximum summer insolation (e.g., Berger, 1978; Bartlein et al., 2011). Its timing varies widely from region to region but is generally detected in paleorecords between 11 and 5 cal ka BP (e.g., Kaufman et al., 2004; Bartlein et al., 2011; Renssen et al., 2012).  … In Kamchatka, the timing of the HTM varies. Dirksen et al. (2013) find warmer-than-present conditions between 9000 and 5000 cal yr BP in central Kamchatka and between 7000 and 5800 cal yr BP at coastal sites.”

Stivrins et al., 2017  (Latvia)
“Conclusion: Using a multi-proxy approach, we studied the dynamics of thermokarst characteristics in western Latvia, where thermokarst occurred exceptionally late at the Holocene Thermal Maximum. …  [A] thermokarst active phase … began 8500 cal. yr BP and lasted at least until 7400 cal. yr BP. Given that thermokarst arise when the mean summer air temperature gradually increased ca. 2°C beyond the modern day temperature, we can argue that before that point, the local geomorphological conditions at the study site must have been exceptional to secure ice-block from the surficial landscape transformation and environmental processes.”

Bañuls-Cardona et al., 2017  (Spain)
“During the Middle Holocene we detect important climatic events. From 7000 to 6800 [years before present] (MIR 23 and MIR22), we register climatic characteristics that could be related to the end of the African Humid Period, namely an increase in temperatures and a progressive reduction in arboreal cover as a result of a decrease in precipitation. The temperatures exceeded current levels by 1°C, especially in MIR23, where the most highly represented taxon is a thermo-Mediterranean species, M. (T.) duodecimcostatus.”

Reid, 2017 (Global)
“The small increase in global average temperature observed over the last 166 years is the random variation of a centrally biased random walk. It is a red noise fluctuation. It is not significant, it is not a trend and it is not likely to continue.”

Åkesson et al., 2017 (Norway)
“Reconstructions for southern Norway based on pollen and chironomids suggest that summer temperatures were up to 2 °C higher than present in the period between 8000 and 4000 BP, when solar insolation was higher (Nesje and Dahl, 1991; Bjune et al., 2005; Velle et al., 2005a).”

Molnár and Végvári, 2017 (SE Central Europe)
“Our study provides an estimate for the value of MAT of HTM of Pannon region with an interval of 0.4°C, relying on macroecological considerations. We calculate the temperature of the HTM [Holocene Thermal Maximum] 1.3–1.7°C warmer than the present temperature.”

Lusas et al., 2017 (East Greenland)
“The lack of glacio-lacustrine sediments throughout most of the record suggests that the ice cap was similar to or smaller than present throughout most of the Holocene. This restricted ice extent suggests that climate was similar to or warmer than present, in keeping with other records from Greenland that indicate a warm early and middle Holocene. Middle Holocene magnetic susceptibility oscillations, with a ~200-year frequency in one of the lakes, may relate to solar influence on local catchment processes. … Air temperatures in Milne Land, west of our study area, based on preliminary estimates from chironomids, may have been 3–6°C warmer than at present (Axford et al. 2013), and in Scoresby Sund itself, warm ocean fauna, including Mytilus edulis and Chlamys islandica, both of which live far to the south today, occupied the fjords (Sugden and John 1965; Hjort and Funder 1974; Street 1977; Funder 1978; Bennike and Wagner 2013; Fig. 13).  … Recession of Istorvet ice cap in the last decade has revealed plant remains that show that the glacier was smaller than at present during the early stages of the Medieval Warm Period, but expanded during the late Holocene ca. AD 1150 (Lowell et al. 2013).”

Hu et al., 2017 (Yellow River, China)
“According to the pollen records in the HRYR [Headwater Region of the Yellow River], the climate in the Holocene thermal maximum was warmer and wetter than present (temperature was 2 -3 °C higher than present)“

"**A new national security office has been officially opened in Hong Kong, placing mainland Chinese agents in the heart of the territory for the first time.**
The office is one element of a sweeping new law which outlaws criticism of China's government.
Hong Kong was, until the law was passed, the only part of China not subject to such policies.
The law has caused alarm in Hong Kong but officials say it will restore stability after violent protests.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday that it was ""actually relatively mild as far as national security laws are concerned"" and would enable Hong Kongers to ""exercise their rights and freedoms without being intimidated and attacked"".
The temporary base of the new office is a hotel in Causeway Bay, the commercial district next to Victoria Park, which had long been the focal point of pro-democracy protest marches and rallies in Hong Kong.
An opening ceremony was held on Wednesday morning, attended by dignitaries including Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Zheng Yanxiong, the hardliner chosen by Beijing to head up the new office.
The Chinese flag was raised outside the office, amid heavy security including a bomb disposal unit.
Luo Huining, head of the existing Hong Kong-Beijing liaison office, said the office would be ""the envoy for Hong Kong's safety and is also the gatekeeper of national security"".
Security agents from the mainland who are based in the new office will, for the first time, have the power to investigate people for a wide range of crimes defined by the new law, and potentially extradite them to the mainland for trial.
Chinese courts, which are controlled by the Communist Party, have a close to 100% conviction rate.
The legislation is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since it was handed back to China by the UK in 1997.
It has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the handover, which gave the territory a lot of control over how it ran itself.
Several prominent figures from the anti-Beijing protest movement have left Hong Kong or closed their social media accounts in the wake of the law.
Several social media companies have said they will stop co-operating with the Hong Kong police on requests for user data over concerns about how it will be used, while TikTok has said it is pulling out of Hong Kong entirely.
Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law
Minutes after new law, pro-democracy voices quit

Miscellaneous Notes
At time of posting, all 5 monthly data sets were available through July 2016. The NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data runs 2 days behind real-time. Therefore, real data through August 29th is used, and the 30th and 31st are assumed to have the same anomaly as the 29th.
August will be the 13th consecutive month that sets a new record for that specific calendar month. I.e. August 2015 was the hottest August in NCEP/NCAR data to that time; September 2015 was the hottest September to that time; October 2015 was the hottest October to that time, etc. NCEP/NCAR data goes back to January 1948.
The global NCEP/NCAR anomaly (HadCRUT/GISS/NCEI) and the UAH-proxy subset anomaly were little-changed from last month. Most of the globe cooled slightly, while Antarctica warmed significantly. Because the RSS analysis only reaches down to 70°S, RSS missed the Antarctic warmth, and its proxy NCEP/NCAR anomaly fell noticably.

The graph above is a plot of recent NCEP/NCAR daily anomalies, versus 1994-2013 base, similar to Nick Stokes’ web page. The trendlines are as follows…

Black – The longest line with a negative slope goes back to early August, 2015, as noted in the graph legend. This is near the start of the El Nino, and nothing to write home about. Reaching back to 2005 or earlier would be a good start.
Green – This is the trendline from a local minimum in the slope around late 2004, early 2005. To even BEGIN to work on a “pause back to 2005”, the daily anomaly has to drop below the green line.
Pink – This is the trendline from a local minimum in the slope from mid-2001. Again, the daily anomaly needs to drop below this line to start working back to a pause to that date.
Red – The trendline back to late 1997. Again, the daily anomaly needs to drop below this line to start working back to a pause to that date.

"More than 600 people have been arrested during five days of climate crisis protests in central London, police have said. Environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion (XR) reignited its efforts to highlight the dangers of climate crisis this month after they were largely placed on hold by the coronavirus pandemic.  In a series of daily actions, protesters have marched on Parliament Square, blocked roads, staged sit-ins and glued themselves to the ground. The protests led the Metropolitan police to impose conditions on where demonstrations could take place, while protesters were warned they risked a large fine if they failed to comply with coronavirus rules banning gatherings of more than 30 people. Scotland Yard also said on Saturday that 20 people had been reported for consideration of a £10,000 fixed penalty notice (FPN) for holding regulation-breaching gatherings representing a range of different causes. Police said the FPN reports related to demonstrations called Resist the Government, Move One Million, The Ivory Coast Protest, Citizens’ Assembly Extinction Rebellion and The Lightship Greta procession. One penalty report related to an anti-government demonstration that took place in Trafalgar Square on 30 August, the Met said. Kyle Gordon, gold commander for the weekend’s policing operation, said protests had caused “serious disruption to local communities” in the past week. He added: “Throughout this period we have become increasingly concerned the organisers of these events have not always taken all reasonable measures to limit the risk of transmission of coronavirus, thereby posing a risk, not only to those involved, but the wider public and communities of London. “We remain in the middle of a pandemic and we all need to play our part in keeping each other and our communities safe.” He said officers sought to enforce coronavirus legislation “as a last resort” and had proactively told event organisers of their “public health risk”. Gordon added: “I would appeal to anyone planning on organising a gathering to consider your responsibilities under the regulations, and to do all you can to help keep our communities safe.” On Saturday afternoon, an XR Citizens Assemble! gathering was dispersed by police in Trafalgar Square. During the peaceful protest outside the National Gallery, activists sat on the ground and listened to speeches while surrounded by a large police presence. Officers asked the group to move on, with most dispersing by around 2.30pm. Some that refused to leave the area were carried or led away by police, including one man in handcuffs. Darcy Mitchell, 45, from Bristol, told the PA news agency: “I’m here because scientists tell us that my children are going to see between three and five degrees of global warming in their lifetime.” He warned this could lead to mass starvation, while young people were seeing the world “burning their future”. A 68-year-old protester, who gave her name only as Wendy, said she was concerned that “the planet is dying and we’re helping it to die”. She said police had been courteous, but she was prepared to be arrested. A 32-year-old protester, who asked to be identified as just Jason, claimed the government was completely ignoring climate crisis. “It’s not something that can wait any more. This whole thing is people power,” he said. “I’m willing to be arrested, I’m willing to stand up for my rights and stand up for what I believe in.” Jason said 99% of protesters were wearing masks and trying to physically distance. A five-a-side football match was also staged underneath nearby Nelson’s Column to highlight criticism of Barclays. Protesters claimed the bank, a partner and former title sponsor of the Premier League, is the “largest funder of fossil fuels in Europe”. Meanwhile, police said they had seized the Lightship Greta, a 20ft model boat named after teenage activist Greta Thunberg, in Kennington, south London. The boat, bearing the words “Sound the alarm – Climate Emergency”, had been marched on foot from Brighton."
"What is the real agenda behind the proponents of an ETS, a tax on thin air which will do nothing to alter the climate for better or for worse? They have successfully recruited large numbers of useful fools who have been brainwashed into believing they can ‘save the planet’ by doing petty things such as this claim at the bottom of an invoice received recently from a supplier: ‘We’re Green. We have saved a total of  0.5143  trees since January 2005 by using paperless invoicing for 4287 invoices’. 
It would have taken less effort to simply plant a tree, for all the good even that would have done in the vastness of things. And what is a tree? What is 0.5143 of a tree? How much carbon dioxide does it contain? Questions, questions. This is the sort of Garbage In – Garbage Out that we can expect if any form of an ETS is introduced. How many lawyers, accountants and regulators will waste their lives measuring, auditing, accounting for and policing thin air? And to how many decimal places? And how are we going to feed them all while the producers of real wealth sink in a tidal wave of paperwork even if the forms are paperless.
Prosperity is the key to eliminating real pollution (particulate matter, rubbish, sulphates etc) on a global scale. An ETS will introduce a new pest into this country more destructive to our prosperity than the rabbit, and our ability to deal with natural climate change will be greatly diminished if our politicians continue down this yellow brick road, at the end of which they will find only smoke and mirrors.

Last week, a Gallup poll was released revealing that about one‐​third of Americans worry “a great deal” about global warming, a number that hasn’t changed much since 1989. Less than half of the respondents believed that climate change would pose a serious threat to them in their lifetimes. The trade publication _ClimateWire_ (subscription required) quotes a Gallup official as noting that “there has been no consistent upward trend on worry about global warming going back for decades.”   
  
  
Today, _ClimateWire_ reports that a new study from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press has even worse news for environmentalists: climate change is at the absolute bottom of the public’s list of priorities for the federal government (oddly enough, there’s no trace of the report on Pew’s website). When given a list of issues and asked to state whether the issue should be a “top priority” for President Bush and the Congress, those surveyed responded as follows:   
  
  
Strengthening the nation’s economy: 75%   
Defending the country against terrorism: 74%   
Reducing health care costs: 69%   
Improving the educational system: 66%   
Securing social security: 64%   
Improving the job situation: 61%   
Securing Medicare: 60%   
Dealing with energy problems: 59%   
Reducing the budget deficit: 58%   
Protecting the environment: 56%   
Reducing crime: 54%   
Providing insurance to the uninsured: 54%   
Dealing with the problems of the poor: 51%   
Dealing with illegal immigration: 51%   
Reducing middle class taxes: 49%   
Dealing with moral breakdown: 43%   
Strengthening the military: 42%   
Reducing the influence of lobbyists: 39%   
Dealing with global trade: 37%   
Making tax cuts permanent: 35%   
Dealing with global warming: 35%   
  
  
Surprised? You shouldn’t be. The political strength of the environmental lobby is almost entirely based on the proposition that they represent a large number of well organized swing voters who will reward and/​or punish politicians for their position on environmental issues in general and climate change in particular. Hence, a great deal of hard work and effort goes into the Green campaign to scare hell out of politicians regarding the political risks associated with saying no to things like a cap & trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To be fair, all special interest groups have the same incentive to talk‐​up their alleged public support. Regardless, this particular political Green emporer has no clothes.

New Paper: Models Need ‘Forcing’ Adjustment…Underestimate Past Warmth, Internal Variability…Instrumental Record ‘Biased’

Büntgen et al., 2017
Spanning the period 1186-2014 CE, the new reconstruction reveals overall warmer conditions around 1200 and 1400, and again after ~1850. The coldest reconstructed summer in 1258 (-4.4°C wrt 1961-1990) followed the largest known volcanic eruption of the CE. The 20th century is characterized by pronounced summer cooling in the 1970s, subsequently rising temperatures until 2003, and a slowdown of warming afterwards. Little agreement is found with climate model simulations that consistently overestimate recent summer warming and underestimate pre-industrial temperature changes.

[W]hen it comes to disentangling natural variability from anthropogenically affected variability the vast majority of the instrumental record may be biased. … Although the causes of the recently measured slowdown in global and regional warming during the last decade are still debated (Karl et al. 2015; Fyfe et al. 2016), our study provides the first long-term proxy evidence for this temperature decline over the western Mediterranean basin. This finding is in line with local, regional and sub-continental meteorological observations, and consistent with the observations by Gleisner et al. (2015) that the post-2003 pause in rising mean surface temperatures is most strongly expressed at mid-latitudes.

The reconstructed long-term variability exceeds the pre-industrial multi-decadal to centennial variability in four state-of-the-art climate model simulations. This mismatch between the proxy reconstructions and the four model simulations is in line with a general tendency of state-of-the-art climate model simulations to underestimate the amplitude of reconstructed natural low-frequency temperature variability during the last millennium (Bothe et al. 2013; Fernández-Donado et al. 2013; Phipps et al. 2013; Luterbacher et al. 2016; Ljungqvist et al. 2012). Such disagreement might indicate that the role of internal unforced variability is greater than expected (Goosse 2017; Matsikaris et al. 2016), and/or that the climate sensitivity to the prescribed forcings needs adjustment. … [S]tate-of-the-art climate models are usually driven by a relatively dampened amplitude of long-term changes in solar activity (Schmidt et al. 2011,2012).

NCEI https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/global/globe/land_ocean/p12/12/1880-2016.csv

When this post was submitted, HadCRUT4 was only available through April 2016. The other 4 data sets were available through May 2016.
 
About the Data Sets
There’s no nice way of putting it. While my projections for 4 of the data sets (HadCRUT4/GISS/RSS/NCEI) were reasonably close, the UAH data set projections have busted badly. Looking into the situation, I noted that RSS data covers 82.5°N to 70°S and that UAH data covers 85°N to 85°S. I was using NCEP/NCAR data for 90°N to 90°S to correlate with all 5 data sets. That worked for HadCRUT4, GISS, and NCEI, and somehow for RSS. But not for UAH. Except for the latitude bands 90°N-88.75°N and 90°S-88.75°S, NCEP/NCAR data is done in 2.5 degree grids. I’ve modified my “global average” calculation program to generate 3 sets of anomalies…

global 90°N to 90°S
RSS 81.25°N to 68.75°S
UAH 83.75°N to 83.75°S

This is as close a match as possible for the satellite sets. It may not be a perfect match, but it’s a much better “apples-to-apples” comparison than using 90°N to 90°S. How much better? We’ll find out in the next few days.
Here’s one qualitative prediction. I’ve been following various sources that show major cooling in Antarctica in June. Because it only covers down to 70°S, RSS will miss that cooling. Net result will be that RSS will show less cooling May-to-June than UAH. The surface data sets may miss it as well, due to their poor coverage of Antarctica, as indicated in the images below. My RSS-specific anomaly projects a minimal drop for June. But the surface data sets are assumed to cover the entire globe. This implies that the surface data sets (HadCRUT4/GISS/NCEI) may come in a bit warmer than my projections.
Global coverage (or lack thereof)
UAHv6, which covers 85°N to 85°S looks like the best data set as far as global coverage is concerned, followed by RSS with coverage 82.5°N to 70°S. The other surface and sea data sets are no better, and arguably worse. For example, from the GISS site:
NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
Looks great? But select ocean data “none” and smoothing radius 250 km for May 2016 and click on “Make Map”. Try “Robinson” and “Polar Orthographic” projections. Land areas in grey are missing. Not only is GISS missing a lot of the polar regions, but also most of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, plus chunks of South America and Australia.
NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
NCEI is no better. May land data is available here.
National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
When combined with ocean data, that somehow translates into this:
National Climatic Data Center
HadCRUT4 has similar coverage as shown on their website. They use 5 degree grid squares, which are squares 556 km on each side at the equator. The larger grid squares give the illusion of better coverage, but don’t affect the reality
Met Office Hadley Centre
There are holes in the data regardless of which data set is used. The only question is how much data is missing. It would also be interesting to see the data points and smoothing used for sea surface temperature anomalies.

"Disappearing Arctic sea ice has brought new opportunities for shipping, and placed the top of the world squarely on industry and politicians’ agendas. When the bulk carrier MV Nordic Orion last week ferried 73,500 tons of coal from Vancouver, Canada to Pori, Finland, it was the first to traverse the Northwest Passage (NWP) through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as a commercial trade route.  This northern route can be substantially shorter. The Nordic Orion cut more than 1,000 nautical miles (1,850km) off the traditional route through the Panama Canal. And without the size and displacement constraints of the canal, it was able to carry 15,000 additional tons of cargo. All this meant time and fuel saved, better utilisation of the full capacity of the ship, and reduced CO2 emissions. Does this mean that the fabled Northwest Passage searched for by numerous valiant explorers in the past, has finally opened for business? Is this a potential challenger to established international shipping routes such as the Suez and the Panama canals? The debate over Arctic shipping has focused more on the growing use of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) over Russia’s northern shores. China and other major Asian exporters have voiced their interest in northeastern routes that would circumvent shipping routes through regions plagued by regional conflicts, terrorists and piracy. The number of ships transiting the route and volumes of cargo carried are rising again, having declined significantly since their peak of 7m tons in 1987. The easier ice conditions of the Eurasian Arctic route has led experts to expect Arctic shipping through the NSR to gain global significance. The extent of sea ice in the Arctic in late September 2013, a point very close to the annual minimum, shows the Canadian Arctic sea far more choked with ice than along the Russian coast, making regular shipping much more feasible. There’s also far less emergency response infrastructure and capabilities on the North American side than along the Norwegian and Russian coasts. There are no deepwater ports along the North Slope of Alaska, for example, and only very few throughout the Canadian Archipelago. And in any case, the remoteness, harsh weather conditions, ice, winter darkness and summer fog make the North American Arctic highly risky. Even after giving notice to the Canadian Coast Guard agency NORDREG, any emergency would be a huge challenge, with Coast Guard facilities far away. Taken together this suggests the MV Nordic Orion will most likely not be followed by many other commercial users of the Northwest Passage. Instead, it was more a demonstration of the shipping company’s technology to master ice-strewn waters. In fact the company’s own press release states that it is an “ice-class 1A ship”, the highest conventional ice-class, and “one of the only ships that can sail the route.” The harsh conditions in the Arctic demand special ship design; such ships are expensive and not available in large numbers. Neither are the economics of using the northern routes assured. Both northeastern and northwestern routes are possible for only a few months, and are relevant only for certain commodities found in the region, such as coal, oil and gas, copper and nickel, or timber. And shipping records seem to confirm this: most Arctic shipping today and forecasted for the future is to or from Arctic destinations. Shipping that crosses the Arctic from the Atlantic to the Pacific or vice versa is of little importance. This is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. For example, while 46 vessels crossed the NSR in 2012, the Suez Canal sees around 18,000 a year, and the Panama Canal 14,000. The current expansion of the Panama Canal and a possible new canal in Nicaragua could make crossing via South America cheaper for shipping companies, and thus more attractive than risky northern routes. And generally, global trade patterns are likely to develop in such a way that northern routes might not be very attractive. Rising consumer power among the growing populations of Asia, South America and India will draw shipping routes further south, for example. New shipping hubs will appear in these countries that many ships will want to call at when crossing oceans, and the Arctic routes will often no longer be shorter. Overall, it’s worth bearing in mind the multitude of problems and hindrances to the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route becoming major maritime routes, from the difficult weather, to the narrow annual window, and shifting global markets. One ship sailing the Northwest Passage is not an indication that large scale commerce is coming to Arctic waters."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs usual, there are many highly interesting posts on climate science at the German Die kalte Sonne site. What follows is one of the latest, on Harde’s controversial paper:
========================================
Is CO2 residence time in the atmosphere exaggerated?
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The CO2 content in the earth’s atmosphere has risen to a level that surpasses any level seen over the past 800,000 years (Fig. 1). While during the ice ages the CO2 concentration dropped to 180 ppm, it rose to 250 – 300 ppm during the warm periods (interglacials). The reason for this CO2 development is foremost is the gassing out of CO2 from warmed up interglacial water.
Since the start of the industrial revolution the CO2 concentration has reached well above the typical range seen during the previous interglacials. Currently the atmospheric CO2 concentration is a bit over 400 ppm.

Fig. 1: CO2-concentration over the past 80,000 years. Source: Scripps Institution of Oceanography, via Climate Central.
The big question now is how long will it take nature to bring down the anthropogenic CO2 build-up if CO2 emissions were to be massively cut back? Let’s assume that beginning today all coal, oil and gas were to be banned outright. How many years would it take for the CO2 to be absorbed by the natural cycles from the atmosphere?
IPCC: 1000 years
The 5th IPCC report writes here that 60 – 85% of the anthropogenic CO2 would disappear from the atmosphere in about 1000 years. But the complete removal would take a few hundred thousands of years. In Chapter 6 from Working Group 1:
The removal of human-emitted CO2 from the atmosphere by natural processes will take a few hundred thousand years (high confidence). Depending on the RCP scenario considered, about 15 to 40% of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years. This very long time required by sinks to remove anthropogenic CO2 makes climate change caused by elevated CO2 irreversible on human time scale.”

Other experts say 100 years
According to the German Ministry of Environment (UBA) things are, however, quicker. At the UBA website we find:
Carbon dioxide is a colorless and odorless gas whose average residence life in the atmosphere is 120 years.”
German climate scientist Mojib Latif also accepts a similar figure: Infranken.de reported on 13 January 2016 on a presentation made by Latif within the scope of a Lion’s Club event:
‘CO2 remains in the air 100 years’
Climate scientist Professor Mojib Latif as a guest speaker brought attention to climate change at the New Year’s meeting. […] ‘When we blow CO2 into the air, then it stays there for 100 years,’ said Latif.”
New paper: Just a few years
Hermann Harde of the Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg described in a paper that appears in the May 2017 journal Global and Planetary Change and which is already available online presents a new approach that points to a much shorter residence time in the atmosphere. According to Harde, excess CO2 remains in the atmosphere on average only 4 years:
Scrutinizing the carbon cycle and CO2 residence time in the atmosphere
Climate scientists presume that the carbon cycle has come out of balance due to the increasing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change. This is made responsible for the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over recent years, and it is estimated that the removal of the additional emissions from the atmosphere will take a few hundred thousand years. Since this goes along with an increasing greenhouse effect and a further global warming, a better understanding of the carbon cycle is of great importance for all future climate change predictions. We have critically scrutinized this cycle and present an alternative concept, for which the uptake of CO2 by natural sinks scales proportional with the CO2 concentration. In addition, we consider temperature dependent natural emission and absorption rates, by which the paleoclimatic CO2 variations and the actual CO2 growth rate can well be explained. The anthropogenic contribution to the actual CO2 concentration is found to be 4.3%, its fraction to the CO2 increase over the Industrial Era is 15% and the average residence time 4 years.”
This value is not to be confused with the residence time of single CO2 molecules in the atmosphere. Here there’s widespread agreement that the molecules themselves remain in the air only a few years before they get replaced by CO2 from the oceans in the sense of an equilibrium reaction.

From the UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA – IRVINE
Climate change has less impact on drought than previously expected
Plants retain more moisture in high carbon dioxide conditions, keeping water on land
Irvine, Calif., Aug. 29, 2016 – As a multiyear drought grinds on in the Southwestern United States, many wonder about the impact of global climate change on more frequent and longer dry spells. As humans emit more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, how will water supply for people, farms, and forests be affected?
A new study from the University of California, Irvine and the University of Washington shows that water conserved by plants under high CO2 conditions compensates for much of the effect of warmer temperatures, retaining more water on land than predicted in commonly used drought assessments.
According to the study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the implications of plants needing less water with more CO2 in the environment changes assumptions of climate change impacts on agriculture, water resources, wildfire risk, and plant growth.
The study compares current drought indices with ones that take into account changes in plant water use. Reduced precipitation will increase droughts across southern North America, southern Europe and northeastern South America. But the results show that in Central Africa and temperate Asia — including China, the Middle East, East Asia and most of Russia — water conservation by plants will largely counteract the parching due to climate change.
“This study confirms that drought will intensify in many regions in the future,” said coauthor James Randerson, UCI professor of Earth system science. “It also shows that plant water needs will have an important influence on water availability, and this part of the equation has been neglected in many drought and hydrology studies.”
Recent studies have estimated that more than 70 percent of our planet will experience more drought as carbon dioxide levels quadruple from pre-industrial levels over about the next 100 years. But when researchers account for changes in plants’ water needs, this falls to 37 percent, with bigger differences concentrated in certain regions.
The reason is that when Earth’s atmosphere holds more carbon dioxide, plants actually benefit from having more of the molecules they need to build their carbon-rich bodies. Plants take in carbon dioxide through tiny openings called stomata that cover their leaves. But as they draw in carbon dioxide, moisture escapes. When carbon dioxide is more plentiful, the stomata don’t need to be open for as long, and so the plants lose less water. The plants thus draw less water from the soil through their roots.
Global climate models already account for these changes in plant growth. But many estimates of future drought use today’s standard indices, like the Palmer Drought Severity Index, which only consider atmospheric variables such as future temperature, humidity and precipitation.
“New satellite observations and improvements in our understanding hydrological cycle have led to significant advances in our ability to model changes in soil moisture,” said Randerson. “Unfortunately, using proxy estimates of drought stress can give us misleading results because they ignore well-established principles from plant physiology.”
Planners will need accurate long-term drought predictions to design future water supplies, anticipate ecosystem stresses, project wildfire risks and decide where to locate agricultural fields.
“In some sense there’s an easy solution to this problem, which is we just have to create new metrics that take into account what the plants are doing,” said lead author Abigail Swann, a University of Washington assistant professor of atmospheric sciences. “We already have the information to do that; we just have to be more careful about ensuring that we’re considering the role of the plants.”
Is this good news for climate change? Although the drying may be less extreme than in some current estimates, droughts will certainly increase, researchers said, and other aspects of climate change could have severe effects on vegetation.
“There’s a lot we don’t know, especially about hot droughts,” Swann said. The same drought at a higher temperature might have more severe impacts, she noted, or might make plants more stressed and susceptible to pests.
“Even if droughts are not extremely more prevalent or frequent, they may be more deadly when they do happen,” she said.

From NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the “just watch, they’ll blame climate change anyway” department comes this forecast:
An analysis of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission shows greater soil water deficits in 2016 than previous drought years with high Amazon fire activity. CREDIT Yang Chen, University of California, Irvine
The long-lasting effects of El Niño are projected to cause an intense fire season in the Amazon, according to the 2016 seasonal fire forecast from scientists at NASA and the University of California, Irvine.
El Niño conditions in 2015 and early 2016 altered rainfall patterns around the world. In the Amazon, El Niño reduced rainfall during the wet season, leaving the region drier at the start of the 2016 dry season than any year since 2002, according to NASA satellite data.
Wildfire risk for the dry season months of July to October this year now exceeds fire risk in 2005 and 2010, drought years when wildfires burned large areas of Amazon rainforest, said Doug Morton, an Earth scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center who helped create the fire forecast.
“Severe drought conditions at the start of the dry season set the stage for extreme fire risk in 2016 across the southern Amazon,” Morton said.
The Amazon fire forecast uses the relationship between climate and active fire detections from NASA satellites to predict fire season severity during the region’s dry season. Developed in 2011 by scientists at University of California, Irvine and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the forecast model is focused particularly on the link between sea surface temperatures and fire activity. Warmer sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific (El Niño) and Atlantic oceans shift rainfall away from the Amazon region, increasing the risk of fires during dry season months.
The team also uses data on terrestrial water storage from the joint NASA/German Aerospace Center (DLR) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission to follow changes in groundwater during the dry season. GRACE measurements serve as a proxy for the dryness of soils and forests.
The NASA and UC-Irvine scientists have worked with South American official and scientists to make them aware of the forecast in recent years. Liana Anderson, a Brazilian scientist from the National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (CEMADEN), said that “fire forecasts three to six months before peak fire activity are important to identify areas with higher fire probability for integrated planning in support of local actions.”
For 2016, El Niño-driven conditions are far drier than 2005 and 2010 – the last years when the region experienced drought. The team has also developed a web tool to track the evolution of the Amazon fire season in near real time. Estimated fire emissions from each forecast region are updated daily, based on the relationship between active fire detections – made by the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite – and fire emissions data from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) in previous years. So far, however, the region has seen more fires to date than those years, another indicator that aligns with the fire severity forecast.
“When trees have less moisture to draw upon at the beginning of the dry season, they become more vulnerable to fire, and evaporate less water into the atmosphere,” said UC-Irvine scientist Jim Randerson, who collaborated with UC-Irvine scientist Yang Chen on building the forecast model. “This puts millions of trees under stress and lowers humidity across the region, allowing fires to grow bigger than they normally would.”
Fires in the Amazon have local, regional, and long-distance impacts. Agricultural fires that escape their intended boundaries can damage neighboring croplands and Amazon forests. Even slow-moving forest fires cause severe forest degradation, as Amazon rainforest trees are not adapted to fire. Together, intentional fires for agricultural management, deforestation, and wildfires generate massive smoke plumes that degrade regional air quality, exacerbating problems with asthma and respiratory illness. Smoke from Amazon fires eventually flows south and east over major urban centers in southern Brazil, including São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, contributing to air quality concerns.
While scientists have been working with South American officials to broadcast the results of the fire forecasts and increase awareness of fire risk, they also said that the work could lead to better wildfire forecasts in other regions of the world. The team recently identified 9 regions outside the Amazon where fire season risk can also be forecast 3-6 months ahead of peak fire activity. It may be possible to build operational seasonal fire forecasts for much of Central America and for many countries in Southeast Asia, Randerson said.

"**Police in Hong Kong are seeking the arrest of six pro-democracy activists living in exile in Western countries, including the UK, media reports say.**
The group reportedly includes former UK consulate worker Simon Cheng, well-known activist Nathan Law and US citizen Samuel Chu.
They are wanted on suspicion of violating a new security law imposed in Hong Kong by Beijing, Chinese state TV reported, calling them ""troublemakers"".
Hong Kong police declined to comment.
The development comes after legislative elections scheduled for September were delayed for a year by Hong Kong's government on Friday.
It said the move was necessary because of a spike in Covid-19 infections, but the opposition accused it of using the pandemic as a pretext. The White House said the move undermined democracy.
Pro-democracy politicians had hoped to capitalise on anger in the Chinese territory about the new security law to win a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo).
Many in Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to China in 1997, fear that unique freedoms meant to be guaranteed until 2047 are under serious threat.
The UK and Australia are among countries that have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong in recent weeks. Germany did so on Friday - one of those reported to be on the new ""wanted list"" has received asylum there.
Chinese state TV network CCTV said six people were wanted on suspicion of inciting secession or colluding with foreign forces - both crimes can be punished with up to life in prison under the new security law.
The six, according to CCTV and Hong Kong media, are:
**Simon Cheng** , a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who was recently granted political asylum in Britain. He was detained last August while on a business trip to mainland China and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong.
He denies that and says he was beaten and forced to sign false confessions while in Chinese custody.
Responding to news of the arrest warrant, Mr Cheng told the BBC that he would not stop speaking out about issues in Hong Kong. ""The totalitarian regime now criminalises me, and I would take that not as a shame but an honour,"" he said.
**Nathan Law** , 27, a high-profile activist who has fled to the UK. ""I have no idea what is my 'crime' and I don't think that's important. Perhaps I love Hong Kong too much,"" he said on Twitter.
Mr Law first came to prominence as a student protest leader in 2014. He said he was disappointed and frightened to have to live in exile, and that he was going to have to ""sever"" his relationship with his family in Hong Kong.
**Samuel Chu** , a US citizen. He is the son of Reverend Chu Yiu Ming, a Baptist minister who was one of the founders of the 2014 ""Umbrella Movement"".
Mr Chu runs the Washington DC-based Hong Kong Democracy Council and said he last visited Hong Kong in November 2019.
""I might be the first non-Chinese citizen to be targeted, but I will not be the last. If I am targeted, any American and any citizen of any nation who speaks out for Hong Kong can, and will be, too,"" he said.
The national security law carries extraterritorial provisions that say anyone, including non-Hong Kong residents, can be charged under it.
China says the law is necessary to restore stability and order in the global financial hub.
**Ray Wong** , a pro-independence activist who fled to Germany in 2017 and is now in Britain, told the BBC that the list of ""wanted"" exiles had been drawn up to ""intimidate"" pro-democracy activists who are trying to drum up international support for their cause.
**Honcques Laus** , an 18-year-old now in the UK, first came to prominence in November 2017 when he brandished a pro-independence banner next to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam.
""Come arrest me in the UK,"" he was quoted - as Lau Hong - as telling a journalist on Friday.
**Wayne Chan** , another pro-independence activist, is in an undisclosed country.
""For me, the situation faced by Hong Kongers is even more dangerous than what I face. I can't think too much about my personal safety,"" he told Reuters news agency."

"“Beaches,” directed by Garry Marshall and released three decades ago, was a curio even in its own time: a pastiche of 1950s   that was set, strangely and uncomfortably, in the 1970s and ’80s. Portraying the lifelong friendship of two women, one of whom dies too young  —   you could say that’s a spoiler, but it’s really the only thing the movie’s about  —   it was a shamelessly retrograde and   soap opera with a veneer of fake feminism. (Careers and single motherhood were fine as long as they involved constant suffering.) Depending on your susceptibilities, it could inspire cultish devotion or impel you to yell at the screen. It was not, by any measure, a movie that needed to be remade. But here we are, 29 years later, with a new television version of “Beaches” on Lifetime on Saturday night. Idina Menzel has taken the Bette Midler role of C. C. Bloom, the brassy Jewish   (originally from the Bronx, now from Venice Beach) and Nia Long succeeds Barbara Hershey as Hillary Whitney, who originally was a   lawyer. The Lifetime “Beaches” is a reduction of the original  —   smaller emotions, smaller performances, fewer songs, shorter running time (about 87 minutes versus 123)  —   and while that could have been an improvement, it’s not. The things that made the original worth sitting through, whether you were   or   are mostly gone. Stuffing the story into 70 percent of the time makes C. C. and Hillary’s cycle of fights and reconciliations feel more arbitrary than ever, especially in the absence of Ms. Midler, whose vivid portrayal of C. C. provided motivations that weren’t in the script. The new things in the Lifetime film, written by Bart Baker and Nicole Beckwith (based on a novel by Iris Rainer Dart) and directed by Allison Anders, add nothing to the story. Casting Ms. Long, who’s black, would seem to add diversity, but so much of the (admittedly clichéd)   and California   flavors have been stripped away from C. C. and Hillary that the characters feel more indistinguishable than they did before. Some of the film’s precious time is devoted to a new character, Hillary’s lawyer father, so that when he dies, she can make a statement about black men and the justice system. Meanwhile, you watch it noting the things that are missing, even those that made you cringe. No more Ms. Midler singing “Under the Boardwalk. ” No more Mayim Bialik as the frighteningly confident    C. C. belting out “The Glory of Love. ” No more John Heard supplying a touch of grace as the theater director whom both C. C. and Hillary love. No more “That’s my robe. ” There is one improvement: Ms. Menzel sings “Wind Beneath My Wings” a   sooner than Ms. Midler did. Just in case that’s what you’re waiting around for."

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today on taxes and small business job creation.



Numerous provisions affect the tax climate for small businesses, including payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and the treatment of capital investment. But I will focus on marginal income tax rates because that’s where there seems to be the most disagreement and uncertainly about the future direction of tax policy. The Obama administration has proposed increasing the top two individual income tax rates, but that policy would likely have a negative impact on U.S. economic growth.



The administration has offered some narrow and temporary tax breaks for small business job creation, but that is not a promising approach for tax policy. Instead, Congress should focus on creating a simple, neutral, and pro‐​growth tax structure for all American businesses, large and small. After all, there is no strict separation of large and small businesses in the tax code. Many businesses that report their profits on individual returns are medium and larger businesses.



New jobs are created by fast‐​growing businesses, whether small or large. A new job at a multinational computer chip maker is certainly as valuable as a new job at the corner restaurant, and probably more durable. Thus, while my remarks focus on tax policies for smaller businesses, large C corporations are also crucial to U.S. economic growth. Policymakers should consider reforms to reduce statutory tax rates on both corporate and noncorporate businesses.1



 **Responses to High Marginal Tax Rates**



The Obama administration is proposing to raise the top two individual income tax rates from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively, in 2011. That would likely harm investment, job creation, and growth. Higher marginal tax rates reduce incentives for productive activities, such as working and expanding businesses, and they increase incentives for unproductive activities, such as tax avoidance and evasion.



If income tax rates rise next year, we may not perceive large negative effects right away, but changes in marginal tax rates do affect behavior over the long term. Some high‐​income workers would decide to work fewer hours and retire a bit earlier. Some spouses in two‐​earner families would decide to stay out of the workforce. Some angel investors would have less cash to invest in start‐​up ventures. And some small businesses would decide not to buy new equipment or hire new workers.



How large are the behavioral responses to marginal income tax rate changes? Many empirical studies have found that reported income is quite responsive to the top income tax rates. In a 2009 paper, for example, economists Emmanuel Saez, Joel Slemrod, and Seth Giertz noted that the share of income “received by the top 1 percent of income recipients started to increase precisely after 1981 when marginal tax rates started to decline. The timing of the jump in the share of top incomes from 1986 to 1988 corresponds exactly to the sharp drop in the weighted average marginal tax rates from 45 percent to 29 percent after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. [This] provides circumstantial but quite compelling evidence that high incomes are indeed responsive to marginal tax rates.“2



A typical finding is that a tax rate increase that reduces the after‐​tax share on additional income by 10 percent results in shrinking reported income by about 4 percent.3 For higher earners, empirical studies usually find substantially larger behavioral responses.4 That’s because higher‐​income taxpayers typically have more flexibility on their working decisions and they have greater shares of financial and business income, which are more responsive and mobile than labor income.



A side‐​effect of these behavioral responses is that governments raise less money than they expect from tax rate increases, particularly at the top end. If Congress raised the top income tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent, the government would gain 4.6 percentage points on the money in the top bracket. But reported income would fall modestly, and that fall would offset a substantial portion of the revenue gain. In a recent paper, economist Robert Carroll summarized Treasury estimates that modeled changes in the top two income tax rates.5 The results suggest that raising the top two rates would cause reported income of affected taxpayers to fall three percent, which would be enough to offset about 40 percent of the expected static revenue gain.



When considering raising tax rates at the top end, Congress needs to think carefully about who would be hit. Today’s highest‐​earners are generally not passive inheritors of wealth, but are usually self‐​made and entrepreneurial.6 Business ownership and current earnings are the main sources of wealth for the richest individuals, while inheritances account for less than one‐​fifth of the assets of the richest people and that share has been declining.7 As economist Glenn Hubbard noted, “when you look at data, you see that people who are rich almost entirely are rich because of entrepreneurial risk taking,“8



Many with high incomes are angel investors, who help to fuel small business expansion. There are at least 300,000 angel investors in the United States, who are often wealthy individuals and have been entrepreneurs themselves.9 They provide an important source of financing for fast‐​growing small businesses. If their taxes go up, they will have less money and fewer incentives to invest, while perhaps parking more of their funds in tax‐​free municipal bonds.



In sum, trying to raise revenue by increasing the top income tax rates is a perverse budget strategy. It would hit some of the most talented people in the economy. Since high earners generally have the largest behavioral responses to taxes, the deadweight losses (or costs of inefficiency) of such tax changes would be quite large.10 And since deadweight losses rise more than proportionally as marginal tax rates rise, raising the top rates would be very counterproductive.11



 **Top Tax Rates and Small Businesses**



The income tax system has a wide‐​ranging impact on businesses. It affects decisions on building factories, purchasing capital equipment, and hiring workers. Rather than trying to micromanage these decisions through the tax code, we should design a system with low statutory rates and neutral treatment to allow businesses to allocate resources efficiently.



More than half of all business income in the United States is reported on individual returns, not corporate returns.12 This income is reported by proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, and S corporations. If the top two individual income tax rates are increased, it would hit a substantial amount of this business income.



It is true that only a small share of the total number of tax returns with business income would be hit by raising the top two tax rates. That’s because many tax returns have small amounts of business income and many self‐​employed persons have modest incomes.



Breaking down the data, Robert Carroll looked at just those individual tax filers who derived more than 50 percent of their income from a business.13 Carroll found that one‐​quarter of these taxpayers‐​who number about 600,000-were in the top two tax rate brackets, and thus would be hit by the proposed tax increases.



A Joint Committee on Taxation analysis looked at the share of business income on individual returns that is in the top two tax rate brackets.14 The JCT found that about 25 million individual tax returns will report about $1 trillion of net positive business income in 2011. Of that total, $437 billion, or 44 percent, will be taxed in the top two income tax brackets and thus will face the proposed tax increase.



Finally, a microsimulation analysis by analysts at the Tax Foundation looked at the share of the proposed tax increase that would fall on business income versus other sorts of income.15 They found that the tax rate increase would raise about $90 billion in 2011, measured on a static basis. Of that total, about $36 billion, or 40 percent, would be from tax increases on business income.



In sum, various estimates show that while only a small share of tax returns will be hit by raising the top income tax rates, those that will be hit represent a large share of all business income on individual returns. Further, business income represents a large share of all the income that will be hit by the proposed tax rate increases.



How will higher tax rates affect entrepreneurship and small business growth? Economists Glenn Hubbard and William Gentry looked at how tax rates affect the initial risky decision to become an entrepreneur, and they found “large” effects.16 Higher marginal tax rates discourage entry into self‐​employment and business ownership. They found, for example, that the 1993 increase in the top tax rate to 39.6 percent “reduced the probability of entry into self‐​employment for upper middle income households by as much as 20 percent.” Hubbard concluded that today’s income tax code gives the message, “if you take a risk and you’re successful, we tax you at a high rate; if you take a risk and you fail, we don’t share that loss with you.“17



A study by Donald Bruce and Tami Gurley for the Small Business Administration similarly found that marginal tax rates affect levels of entrepreneurship.18 Using a detailed empirical model, the authors found that “A reduction in the marginal tax rate on entrepreneurial income of one percentage point would increase the probability of entry into  
entrepreneurial activity by 1.42 percentage points for single filers and 2.0 percentage points for married filers.“19



Once a small business is up and running, empirical tax research by economists Robert Carroll, Douglas Holtz‐​Eakin, Mark Rider, and Harvey Rosen found that higher individual income tax rates negatively affect hiring, investment, and expansion. One of their studies found that changing the “tax price” (one minus the marginal tax rate) faced by small businesses by 10 percent changed the likelihood of hiring workers by about 12 percent.20 Thus, raising the top income tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent would reduce the likelihood of hiring by affected businesses by more than 8 percent.



Another one of their studies found that changing the tax price faced by small businesses by 10 percent caused business revenues to change by about 8 percent.21 That is, raising marginal income tax rates reduces business growth. Finally, one of their studies found that a 5 percentage point increase in marginal tax rates would cause a 10‐​percent reduction in small business capital expenditures.22



The authors noted that tax rate changes affect businesses by altering the return to marginal investments and changing the cash flow available to fuel expansion.23 In other words, higher tax rates reduce both the incentive and the funding for activities such as investment and hiring.



 **International Perspective**



The bipartisan Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced individual income tax rates to a simple structure of 15 and 28 percent. But then tax rates were increased during the 1990s, which the rate cuts of recent years have only partly reversed. President Obama’s proposed top individual rate of 39.6 percent is 41‐​percent higher than the 28‐​percent rate achieved in the late 1980s. (The top effective top rate next year will be even higher if Congress reinstates a phase‐​out of personal exemptions and a limitation on itemized deductions).



Some people think that raising the top income tax rate to 40 percent is no big deal because the top rate was even higher during the mid‐​20th century. But the world economy has dramatically changed since then. In recent decades, nations have floated their exchange rates and opened their borders to capital flows, with the result that cross‐​border investment has exploded. There is also rising international mobility of highly skilled workers in industries such as technology and finance. Thus, in addition to the domestic reasons to reduce marginal tax rates, the competitive pressures of globalization have convinced most nations to cut their top income tax rates.



The average top personal income tax rate in the 30 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell from 68 percent in 1980 to 42 percent in 2008.24 Federal tax rate cuts in 1981 and 1986 established the United States as a tax reform leader, but many other countries had caught up to us with their own rate cuts by 2000.



The chart shows that the top U.S. income tax rate was the same as the average top rate in the OECD in 2000 at just under 47 percent.25 This data includes both federal and state‐​level taxes. Tax rate cuts reduced the U.S. rate to 42 percent by 2008, but other countries have been cutting as well, such that the OECD average rate also fell to about 42 percent.





If the top federal rate is increased by about 5 percentage points next year, the top U.S. rate with state taxes would be more than 46 percent. The United States would jump into the ranks of nations with high individual income tax rates, and we’ve already got the second‐​highest corporate tax rate in the OECD.26 Our nation‐​which has been a bastion of market capitalism and individual achievement‐​has a tax code that is becoming more unfriendly to businesses and high‐​earners than the tax codes of many other nations.



Consider just one possible effect of increased individual tax rates‐​damaging the nation’s historical role as a magnet for smart and productive people. High‐​skill immigrants have flocked to places like Silicon Valley because they could start businesses in a more free‐​market environment than other locations around the world. One 1999 study found that 24 percent of Silicon Valley firms were founded by Chinese and Indian immigrants.27 Similarly, a 2007 study found that one‐​quarter of U.S. technology companies launched in the past decade had an immigrant founder.28



Taxes are only one factor that influences where highly skilled entrepreneurs decide to start businesses. But as other nations have improved their economic polices, America may lose one of its long‐​standing advantages in attracting the elite of the world’s knowledge workers.



 **Conclusions**



The Obama administration has proposed a number of narrow tax breaks for business hiring and investment, including a capital gains provision for small‐​business stock and a $5,000 tax credit for small business hiring. Those provisions would complicate the tax code and would be far inferior to broad‐​based tax rate reduction.



Rather than raising income tax rates next year, policymakers should consider ways to reduce them. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated deductions and credits while cutting statutory rates in a revenue‐​neutral fashion. Today, we have a number of large tax breaks‐​such as the mortgage interest deduction and the state and local tax deduction‐​that are tilted toward high‐​earners, and which we could repeal and use the revenues to cut the top tax rates. Such reforms would enhance economic growth because there is a large amount of business activity in those top rate brackets, as noted.



Even better, Congress should consider a simplified two‐​rate individual tax structure of 10 and 25 percent. Such a structure has been proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and also discussed in the recent National Academy of Sciences study, _Choosing the Nation’s Fiscal Future_.29 The NAS plan has individual tax rates of 10 and 25 percent combined with a 25‐​percent corporate tax in a revenue‐​neutral package. These lower rates would improve marginal incentives for American businesses of all sizes and in all industries.



Thank you for holding these important hearings. I look forward to working with the committee on these issues.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs wind projects continue to get planned throughout Germany, concerns over their effects on nature, wildlife and human health are growing more than ever.
The online Sächsische Zeitung (SZ – Saxony News) reports how one locality in Germany held a public forum on the subject of low-frequency infrasound earlier this year. Infrasound generated by wind turbines is low-frequency at a range that is not audible to the human ear (< 20 Hz), but the air pressure waves are in fact registered by the inner ear. For a fair amount of people these pulsing pressure changes can trigger a variety of physical discomforts, and over the long term to severe health risks, a growing body of literature shows.
The SZ writes that some 160 citizens showed up to get more information on the subject from 5 experts from the state, most of them there to downplay the health issues of infrasound from wind turbines.
For example, Andrea Bauerdorff of the Federal Ministry of Environment claimed that a health impact from infrasound “could not be expected according to the latest scientific knowledge“.
Physicist Bernhard Brenner of the Bavarian Ministry for Health and Food Safety claimed: “With pure infrasound there really is nothing to worry about“. But many in attendance weren’t buying it, as the SZ wrote that Brenner’s comments were met by “jeering laughter from the wind power opponents“.
Another state expert, psychologist Johannes Pohl, admitted that infrasound was a problem for a “tiny part of the population” (6 or 7 percent of those living close to wind turbines) but then blamed “psychological factors” for it.
Thankfully there was one expert who took a far more critical view: state physician Thomas Carl Stiller, who according to the SZ “received again and again applause from the win energy opponents“. Stiller noted that wind turbines posed “a risk of cancer from the carbon fibers in the event of a fire, social polarization, optical blight” and warned that humans are “not able to adapt to infrasound“. He told the audience that long-term infrasound was shown to cause damage to ears, lungs and heart in laboratory rats.
Did the information forum bring the opposing sides closer together? Not at all, the SZ writes, summarizing:
Citizens initiatives against wind energy doubted the studies and the intent of the scientists behind them, […]. One conclusion remained at the end that almost everyone could agree on: The literature is far to thin. Meanwhile the construction of wind energy will continue to be driven without obstruction.”

As we enter Day 7 of the current minor inconvenience, how are things going?



On a selfish front, short term, I can report that the only thing I am really brassed off about is the inability to see my grandchildren; and no, Skype/Facetime/DUO or whatever is not a substitute for the real thing. But apart from that, it’s no big deal. I am lucky that I am retired, live in the country and am adequately provisioned for at least a month. I have plenty to do at home and can even take my thrice weekly country walks without flouting Obergruppenfuhrer Bush’s diktats.



Widening my horizon a little to use the NZ MSM to see how things are tracking, one would think that, because we have such an inspirational leader guiding us through these troubled times, things are also going swimmingly. We have a world first this and world’s best that, to shut down the country, and we have a [daily act of worship at 1300](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/covid-19-update-31-march-2020/) to tell us how all this is going using numbers that look pretty good – as long as you don’t look too hard. This is followed by a few minutes of kindness carrots and ‘the police have powers’ sticks. What’s not to like? We are all in this together and we’ve got this.



But even if you don’t leave Pravda 1 there are worries, are there not? The daily increasing number of methods of narking on a neighbour, (an extra jog per day, 5c on the chocolate afghans at P&S), has come just a few days after the government telling us that they are the only source of the truth. Do those two hand in glove ring any bells from history?



But if you bother to look further than the end of your nose to overseas facts (hard to come by) and opinions (thick on the ground), then things start to get a lot murkier. I will readily admit that my thinking on this is changing pretty rapidly. I still think that our borders were closed too late and the closure is, even now, too porous. However, the rest of the measures to counter this virus are starting to get me very worried.



That this virus is serious and that it is a different animal from common or garden seasonal influenza is pretty apparent. But the reaction to it worldwide, a reaction that is bordering on hysteria, has turned a serious health problem into a social and economic disaster. This has been fuelled by a ghoulish, clickbait driven media and weak politicians who are willing to be led by ‘experts’. In many cases, I am unsure as to what process was used to select these experts who find themselves with powers they were never trained to have.



I now think that the damage to our country in the medium term will be huge but most of the carnage will come from the cure and not the illness. We also need a proper investigation when this is all over, that the measures currently being taken actually resulted in the outcome we end up getting. The small scale corollary to this is that we need (and need it now), the current mortality figures to be reported as death _from_ coronavirus separated from death _with_ coronovirus. Peter Hitchens tells a good parable here.



A man goes to a doctor with pneumonia. The doctor tells him this is very serious and in order to cure the pneumonia he will have to amputate his leg. The man recovers from his pneumonia but now has only one leg. I will not try to plagiarise Hitchens further but urge you to listen to him. 



I hope that the draconian powers vested in the Police in the short term are removed as swiftly as they were installed when the acute phase of this is all over, but my level of confidence here is low. I hope the man-made climate change nutters will not use this current downturn in emissions/pollution as evidence that living in caves wearing animal skins is the way of the future; my expectations here are zero.

"The Czech President, and Ex-President of the EU, Vaclav Klaus, addressing the Summer University at Aix-en-Provence, said that the Global Warming debate is not about temperature, or CO2 levels, or pollution – it is about expansion of Government controls. He commented:
“The advocates of global warming alarmism ask for an almost unprecedented expansion of government intrusion, of government intervention into our lives and of government control over us. We are pushed into accepting rules about how to live, what to do, how to behave, what to consume, what to eat, how to travel. It is unacceptable.”
“One frequent misunderstanding needs to be dispelled. People tend to confuse two conceptually different things – a rational protection of the environment and an irrational attempt to protect (or even to fight) the climate. I am very much in favour of rational efforts when it comes to the environmental protection because we have to take care of our rivers, lakes, seas, forests and air, but I resolutely reject any attempts to change – or as I frequently hear – to combat the climate.”
“The current Global Warming Debate is not about temperature or CO2 levels. It is also not part of a scientific dispute inside climatology. It is an ideological clash between those who want to change us (rather than the climate) and those who believe in freedom, markets, human ingenuity, and technical progress.”

"It is the third hottest day on record in the UK and the cool saline mud oozing through my toes provides welcome relief from the beating sun. I am standing barefoot in a shallow pool in Europe’s largest coastal habitat restoration project, Wallasea Island in Essex. The 670-hectare (1,656-acre) expanse of salt marshes, lagoons and mudflats was formed using more than 3m tonnes of London clay excavated from the Crossrail tunnel network, almost half of the waste material from the entire project. In the heat, crowds of flamingos would not feel out of place, but the sweltering temperature is a gnawing reminder of how rising sea levels and the climate crisis will threaten the UK’s coastline. The problem is so grave that one Dutch government scientist has even proposed a 295-mile (475km) dam of the North Sea to protect large parts of western Europe.  But projects such as Wallasea Island Wild Coast are a far less expensive, natural alternative to managing the rising water. Salt marshes are natural buffers against the wrath of the sea – especially in storm surge conditions – dramatically reducing wave height and soil erosion, as mangrove swamps do in tropical regions. Salt marshes around the UK provide £1bn worth of coastal flood defences, according to one government report. Yet salt marshes themselves are also threatened if they cannot rise with the sea, as is the wildlife they support. At Wallasea Island, Malcolm Ausden, a principal ecologist with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), is sorting through the saline sludge in his green wellies. “Here’s one,” he says, pointing out a bright red non-biting midge larva in his sieve. While only a limited number of species thrive in the multicoloured mud, the shrimps, cockles, insect larvae and young fish species found in the water support thousands of birds throughout the year. Avocets and little egrets wade in the shallows of the 22 lagoons and 67 islands in the project, which has been constructed on reclaimed farmland. Gulls, terns, plovers, buntings and many other species thrive in the Martian, treeless landscape, an unlucky few picked off by peregrine falcons, marsh harriers and kestrels. Hares sprint for cover in the grass meadows that border lagoons. As we continue our walk around the reserve, we stop at a Scandinavian-style shelter, close to the final resting place of Charles Darwin’s Beagle, which lies under the mud in the River Roach. Boats tack past as a handful of seals bask on the opposite bank, conspicuously orange from the iron oxide in the coastal mud. On the southern flank of the nature reserve, a crumbling sea wall holds back the estuary from the protected area. The RSPB controls the levels of the lagoons inside the reserve using a system of sluices. The long-term challenge is rising water levels that might one day overwhelm the sea wall. “If these old sea walls failed, it would massively increase the volume of water flowing in and out of the estuary on each tide, and this would put additional pressure on other sections of sea walls. The wetland creation scheme at Wallasea prevents this from happening, and so helps provide a long-term flood defence solution for the whole estuary,” Ausden says, explaining the importance of clawing back some of the thousands of hectares of intertidal salt marsh that once lined the Essex coast. These ecosystems are already part of any serious chef’s kitchen: Maldon sea salt is produced further up the coast. “Salt marshes and mudflats sequester large quantities of carbon, so that’s helpful in terms of the climate crisis,” says Ausden. “Also, salt marshes in front of sea walls reduce wave action on the sea wall, so they reduce that pressure and help reduce flood risk. And salt marshes provide nursery areas for commercially important fish.” The nature reserve at Wallasea Island is still young, with groundwork on shaping the excavated material from the 26 miles of tunnel for the Crossrail project having only been completed in 2015. A 180-metre temporary jetty was built at the site to receive 2,400 shiploads of soil and load it on to an 800-metre conveyor system to distribute around the reserve. By 2025, the scheme hopes to have created 150 hectares of mudflats, 90 hectares of salt marsh and 165 hectares of shallow saline lagoons that are controlled by barriers to regulate the tidal flow in and out of the protected area. Yet, while the Wallasea Island project is a leading example of a nature-based solution with active human management of the landscape, the scale of the challenge in the rest of the UK is daunting. Salt marshes are found along the Bristol Channel, the Wash, the Thames, the Firth of Forth and other big estuaries and are a vital transitional habitat between the land and ocean. But if they cannot rise at the same rate as the seas, they could disappear, making tidal marshes among the Earth’s most vulnerable ecosystems. In 2018, a study warned that marshland in south-east England could disappear by 2040 if the climate crisis was allowed to continue. If the world sticks to the Paris agreement, the ecosystems survive. Prof Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore and lead author of the 2018paper, said the tipping point appeared to be when the annual rise in sea level reaches 6-7mm, after which salt marshes will drown. “They may try and go landward. But if you’ve got urban squeeze, there are roads and agricultural lands and ditches and dikes, they’ve got nowhere to go,” Horton explains, detailing the huge future cost of tidal defences to cities such as London and Singapore. “You cannot put a sea wall everywhere. The other option is to try and live with sea level rise. So this is where the marshes come in, they protect from erosion, they’ll absorb coastal waves. “You have areas where you let the water in and you live with it – Amsterdam, Venice; there are many, many such examples of that. And then the third one is retreat. You just retreat inland, which for an island nation like the UK is not what you want to do.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"
"There is a colossal scandal erupting in the blogosphere, and in the better media. Someone, probably an insider offended by what he saw was going on, leaked a large volume of emails from within the global warming priesthood centred within the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, UK.
These show a pattern of manipulation, suppression and selection of data and evidence all designed to create and maintain the global warming myth. So now we know – Global Warming is man-made after all – it is created by men using manufactured data, dodgy computer models and “mates reviewed” papers by a small group of dedicated believers posing as scientists.

In upholding the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — aka Obamacare — the US Supreme Court has hardly ended the fight over healthcare reform, merely changed venues.



There is still plenty of time to fight over the healthcare law. 



The individual mandate, like most Obamacare provisions, is not scheduled to go into effect until 2014. Between now and then there will be an election. 



And we can certainly expect healthcare reform to be a key issue in that election.



We now know that Obamacare is constitutional but nothing else about it has changed.



 **Consequences**



All the problems with the law remain. It still increases federal spending, taxes and debt.



It still adds new burdens to struggling businesses, making it harder for them to grow and hire new workers.



It still drives up the cost of health insurance, especially for the young and healthy, and it still puts in place structures that will almost inevitably lead to the rationing of care.



But none of that is the responsibility of the Supreme Court. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion: “It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.”



Politicians, Justice Roberts continued, “can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them”.



Republicans, and in particular the Tea Party, who always saw the healthcare law as a costly over‐​reach, will be energised to do just that.



And while Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney might be a flawed vehicle for criticising the president, given his own enactment of a similar law in the state of Massachusetts, he will nonetheless become the outlet for all those who oppose Obamacare.



In fact, Mr Romney’s campaign reportedly saw a dramatic spike in donations in the first hour after the court’s ruling.



Meanwhile, without wasting any time, Republicans in the House have already scheduled a largely symbolic vote to repeal the law for July 11. 



**‘President Obama lied’**



Opponents of the law have also been handed a potent new political weapon. 



President Obama and Democrats in Congress had argued vociferously that the healthcare law did not increase taxes on most Americans. In particular, the president insisted that the mandate “is absolutely not a tax increase”.



But in upholding the law, the court did so precisely on the grounds that the mandate is a tax.



If so, it would amount to the largest middle‐​class tax hike in recent history. In today’s political climate, that is not something that President Obama wants to defend. In fact, that’s why he spent so much time denying it was a tax hike.



Moreover, by declaring that the mandate was a tax, the court was effectively saying that the president was lying in saying it was not. 



Americans may already cynically discount most of what politicians say, but it cannot be good for the president to get a reputation for being less than forthright.



On the other hand, winning is always better than losing — and on this one the president won.



 **Replacing Obamacare**



If the court had thrown all or most of the law out, the president would have lost his signature accomplishment and looked as if he had wasted much of his first term.



And the court’s decision leaves Mr Romney in the position of arguing not just against the law generally, but also against some of the law’s more popular provisions, such as allowing children to stay on their parents’ policy until age 26 or guaranteeing coverage for individuals with pre‐​existing conditions.



We can expect Mr Romney to push a plan to make health insurance more personal and portable by giving workers the same tax break for buying individual insurance as they currently receive for employer‐​provided insurance.



He will also seek more competition in the insurance market by allowing people to buy insurance across state lines.



And he will attempt to inject more consumer choice into the government’s other big healthcare programs: Medicare and Medicaid.



But he will also be pressed to get more specific about how he will “replace” Obamacare, not just repeal it. So far, he has not been particularly strong in answering those questions.



Overall the law remains unpopular. In the days leading up to the court’s decision, polls showed strong majorities of voters opposing the law and/​or seeking its repeal. 



Support for the law may get a bit of a bump in the wake of the court’s ruling, but in the long run it is likely to remain a drag on the president’s re‐​election.



No matter what, anyone who thinks the court’s decision was the last word on healthcare, probably is in need of a bit of treatment themselves.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community, Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community, a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago. He also called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth,” and he said that up to 1. 5 million people had attended his inauguration, a claim that photographs disproved. Later, at the White House, he dispatched Sean Spicer, the press secretary, to the briefing room in the West Wing, where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements. He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country, warning that the new administration would hold them to account. The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump, a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in. It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency, usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader. Instead, the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive, signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation’s highest office. Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community, with an appearance at the C. I. A. ’s headquarters in Langley, Va. While he was lavish in his praise, the president focused in his   speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation’s spy agencies, and meandered to other topics, including the crowd size at his inauguration, his level of political support, his mental age and his intellectual heft. “I just want to let you know, I am so behind you,” Mr. Trump told more than 300 employees assembled in the lobby for his remarks. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has questioned the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia meddled in the United States election on his behalf. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Trump, he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on Twitter, “Are we living in Nazi Germany?” On Saturday, he said journalists were responsible for any suggestion that he was not fully supportive of intelligence agencies’ work. “I have a running war with the media,” Mr. Trump said. “They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth, and they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. ” “The reason you’re the No. 1 stop is, it is exactly the opposite,” Mr. Trump added. “I love you, I respect you, there’s nobody I respect more. ” Mr. Trump also took issue with news reports about the number of people who attended his inauguration, complaining that the news media used photographs of “an empty field” to make it seem as if his inauguration did not draw many people. “We caught them in a beauty,” Mr. Trump said of the news media, “and I think they’re going to pay a big price. ” Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,” a statement that photographs clearly show to be false. Mr. Spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed “to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,” although he provided no proof of either assertion. Photographs of Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and of Mr. Trump’s plainly showed that the crowd on Friday was significantly smaller, but Mr. Spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the Mall. “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,” Mr. Spicer said. He also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on Friday that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, calling the mistake  —   which was corrected quickly  —   “egregious. ” And he incorrectly claimed that ridership on Washington’s subway system was higher than on Inauguration Day in 2013. In reality, there were 782, 000 riders that year, compared with 571, 000 riders this year, according to figures from the   transit authority. Mr. Spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the National Mall this year, preventing “hundreds of thousands of people” from viewing the ceremony. But the Secret Service said the measures were largely unchanged this year, and there were few reports of long lines or delays. Commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made Mr. Trump increasingly angry on Friday, according to several people familiar with his thinking. On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on “dishonest media” coverage  —   mostly referring to a Twitter post from a New York Times reporter showing    frames of Mr. Trump’s crowd and Mr. Obama’s in 2009. But most of Mr. Trump’s advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president. However, in his remarks at the C. I. A. he wandered off topic several times, at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39 (he is 70) reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying, “I’m, like, a smart person” and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy. “Probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re all on the same wavelength, folks. ” But most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media. And Mr. Spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the White House briefing room. But his appearance, according to the people familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking, went too far, in the president’s opinion. Mr. Trump’s appearance at the C. I. A. touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials. Nick Shapiro, who served as chief of staff to John O. Brennan, who resigned Friday as the C. I. A. director, said Mr. Brennan “is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump’s despicable display of   in front of C. I. A. ’s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. “Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,” Mr. Shapiro added. “I was heartened that the president gave a speech at C. I. A. ,” said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency. “It would have been even better if more of it had been about C. I. A. ” Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he had had high hopes for Mr. Trump’s visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community, but that Mr. Trump’s meandering speech had dashed them. “While standing in front of the stars representing C. I. A. personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country  —   hallowed ground  —   Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,” Mr. Schiff said. “He will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world. ” Mr. Trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the C. I. A. and other intelligence agencies as “the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. ” He did not mention his apparent willingness to believe Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is widely detested at the C. I. A. over his own intelligence agencies. He also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president. The agency sees the president as its main audience, and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the White House. Since the election, hopes at the C. I. A. that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what Mr. Trump and his loyalists have planned. But the nomination of Mike Pompeo, a former Army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community, to lead the C. I. A. has been received positively at the agency. “He has left the strong impression that he doesn’t trust the intelligence community and that he doesn’t have tremendous regard for their work,” Mark M. Lowenthal, a retired C. I. A. analyst, said of Mr. Trump. “The obvious thing to do is to counter that by saying, ‘I value you. I look forward to working with you. ’” “He called them Nazis,” Mr. Lowenthal added, referring to Mr. Trump’s characterization of the intelligence community. Mr. Lowenthal said Saturday’s visit should have been “a stroking expedition. ”"

I guess it is only a matter of time before the Climate Alarmists claim the victory in the climate crisis being averted due to everyone staying at home. The fact that many rational people believe that the sun, not CO2, has a major effect on our climate and that the cooling, or ‘quiet’, sun could be the reason for the temperature not following the models, will be brushed aside.



Note the large uptick in the sea ice area around mid-February when the lockdown began. /sarc



From 3-7 April this year, sea ice around Svalbard Norway has been the highest since 1988, but only 6th or 7th highest since records began in the 1970s. Pack ice this year surrounds Bear Island (Bjørnøya) at the southern end of the archipelago for the first time since 2009 at this date, and continues the pattern of high extent and thickness of ice in the Barents Sea since last summer.



On the 3rd of April 2020, it looked like the highest extent on record had been reached, according to the NIS graph above. But because the graph only goes back to 1981 (see the ‘Min/Max’ dotted line), that’s not the case: it was only the sixth highest compared to records that go back to at least 1969 (and 81,483 sq km above the 1981-2010 average).



However, the difference between extents on 3 April 1988 (511,048 sq km) must be almost statistically indistinguishable from 3 April 2020 (507,194 sq km) because it’s certainly indistinguishable on a graph as crude as the one presented to the public above. Although their archived ice charts available online only go back to 1998 for April, the NIS noted on 3 April 2020 via Twitter:



“The last time there was this much #sea ice around #Svalbard on this day of the year was 1988, with 511,048 sq km. This year’s extent has only been exceeded by, in ascending order, 1988, 1971, 1977, 1969 and 1978.“



On the 7th of April, NIS noted the ice was similarly 7th highest on record (79,124 sq km above the 1981-2010 average at 502,563 sq km), compared to records going back to at least 1969. […]



It is interesting to note that most of the previous records in 1969, 1971, 1977 and 1978 were in the period when there were covers on _Time_ magazine claiming that global cooling was a potential problem and an ice-age was coming.

As the nations of the world busily prepare an international treaty to address greenhouse gas emissions, the public debate over global climate change is heating up. Yet the _political_ debate over what to do about global warming is far different from the scientific debate surrounding the issue, and the gulf between the two is widening, not closing. Politics — not science — is increasingly driving this debate, and truth is increasingly the casualty.



If you rely on the national news media for information about the public debate, here’s what you “know”: the overwhelming consensus is that the science is in, but the naked clout of an unconscionable energy industry is holding up a solution. Consider remarks made last month by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt: “Oil and coal companies in the United States have joined in a conspiracy to hire pseudoscientists to deny the facts, and then begin raising political arguments that are essentially fraudulent.… Energy companies need to be called to account because what they’re doing is un‐​American in the most basic sense. They are compromising our future by misrepresenting the facts by suborning scientists onto their payrolls and attempting to mislead the American people.”



Yet Babbitt is sugarcoating it as far as Ross Gelbspan, a Boston‐​based journalist, is concerned. Gelbspan, author of _The Heat Is On_ , a book currently receiving fawning attention from the _New York Times_ , the _Washington Post_ and most of the other major newspapers, accuses industry of masterminding a conspiracy to cover up the truth and indulging in “the big lie” as “a prelude to a kind of totalitarianism” envisioned in George Orwell’s _1984_.



Most members of the political and journalistic community accept Babbitt’s and Gelbspan’s characterization of the debate, but they’re clearly uneasy that the American public evinces such little concern about global warming and that the administration has yet to commit to the kind of policies necessary to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They are right to worry.



The scientific debate — that is, the debate in the scientific journals and refereed literature — is as different from the public debate as night is from day. While Babbitt, Gelbspan and their sympathizers were huffing and puffing about greenhouse skepticism, the scientific community was, to a large degree, embracing it. 



On May 16, America’s most prestigious scientific journal, _Science_ , published an article titled “Greenhouse Forecasting Still Cloudy.” Said the article, “Many climate experts caution that it is not at all clear yet that human activities have begun to warm the planet — or how bad greenhouse warming will be when it arrives.” Dr. Benjamin Santer, author of a key chapter in the latest report of the UN‐​sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), conceded that “it’s unfortunate that many people read the media hype before they read the [IPCC] chapter” on the detection of greenhouse warming. “I think the caveats are there. We say quite clearly that few scientists would say the attribution issue [the argument that global warming is caused by human industrial activity] was a done deal.”



On June 2, Bert Bolin, chairman of the IPCC, conceded in a debate with environmental scientist Fred Singer of the Science & Environmental Policy Project that “the climate issue is not ‘settled’; it is both uncertain and incomplete.” Bolin further noted that the small amount of warming during the past century occurred mainly before 1940 and is most likely a natural recovery from previous cooling, not a manifestation of human‐​induced warming. 



On July 19, the distinguished British journal _New Scientist_ published a cover story titled “Greenhouse Wars: Why the Rebels Have a Cause.” After a thorough review of the scientific evidence marshaled by both sides, the magazine concluded that the skeptics are “among the world’s top scientists.” The unmistakable if unspoken bottom line of the article is that these skeptics have the better of the scientific argument at present.



Have Babbitt and Gelbspan somehow failed to notice this genuine debate in the world of science? Of course not. As the old lawyers adage goes: When you have the facts on your side, hammer the facts; when you have the law on your side, hammer the law; when you have neither, hammer the table. 



Alarmists in the media and the Clinton administration clearly have decided that the best way to win the global warming debate is by shouting down the opposition and demonizing them in the eyes of the public. But that is not dispassionate scientific debate; it is more like a “struggle meeting” during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Four months before an international conference in Kyoto where a global warming treaty is to be signed, Bruce Babbitt has given us a hint of the debate to come.

"New Yorkers flooded the streets of Manhattan on Saturday aiming to send a message to President Trump that his hometown would be a center of resistance during his administration. The mayor’s office estimated that 400, 000 people took part in the march, which was in concert with other Women’s March rallies across the country. With huge crowds along Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower, a large slice of Manhattan came to a standstill for much of the day. Participants booed Mr. Trump and hoisted signs mocking both his hair and his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It was a moment of both catharsis and camaraderie in a city that was, for the most part, shocked and disappointed by Mr. Trump’s ascendance to the presidency. Holding a “Nasty Woman” sign, Grace Huezo, 20, was buoyed by the huge turnout and the joyful mood. “I’m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they’re keeping their spirit,” she said. “We’re all just going to stick together over the next four years. ” Ms. Huezo, a student at Hunter College, said she was marching with her sister to defend women’s rights. She said she was appalled by the 2005 recording of Mr. Trump’s lewd comments about women that emerged during the campaign. “We’re here saying, ‘No, people do not have permission to grab women without our permission,’” she said. The march began with a rally near Trump World Tower on the East Side, where Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, led the crowd in urging Mr. Trump not to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. “New York City has always been the center of progressive America, and that will never change,” she said. The actress Whoopi Goldberg suggested it would be the first of many marches while Mr. Trump was in office. Hinting at the debate over diversity leading up to the marches, one speaker said she wanted equal pay, and “not just for white women. ” Throughout the day, marchers clogged city streets and overwhelmed subway stations. Men and women wore pink “pussy hats” and held signs that read, “You lost here, Donald,” and “I’m Still With Her. ” Around 4 p. m. near Trump Tower, a wall of police officers tried to keep people moving as protesters chanted, “Black Lives Matter. ” Alice Bucaille said she wanted to bring her two daughters to the march, but decided against it because of violence on Friday after the inauguration ceremony in Washington. Ms. Bucaille said she would have welcomed women with views that differed from hers on abortion, and added that Democrats could no longer live in a bubble. “We need to open the discussion and understand where people are coming from,” she said. “Being inclusive is part of the conversation. ” Plenty of children attended the march with parents and grandparents. Along the route, Annabel Lui, 6, stood on a bench proudly holding a sign that said: “Little Donald, you’ve been a bad boy. Now go to your room for the next four years. ”   stopped to watch as she chanted, “Trump has to go!”"
"Live fast, die young is a truism often applied to rock stars but could just as easily describe trees, according to new research. Trees that grow rapidly have a shorter lifespan, which could spell bad news for tackling the climate crisis. Trees grow faster in warmer conditions, and this should act as a natural brake on global heating, as they take up and store more carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. But the new study casts doubt on this beneficial cycle, finding that the faster trees grow, the sooner they die – and therefore stop storing carbon.  Some fast-growing trees, including conifer species in cold regions, have long been known to show shorter lifespans, but what was not known was the impact of warmer conditions that can spur growth as global heating accelerates. An international team of researchers, publishing their work on Tuesday in the peer-review journal Nature Communications, has found that the relationship between faster growth and shorter lifespan appears to hold good across tree species and latitudes. Roel Brienen, associate professor of geography at the University of Leeds, the lead author of the paper, said: “We started a global analysis and were surprised to find that these trade-offs are incredibly common. It occurred in almost all species we looked at, including tropical trees.” Trees growing faster in warmer conditions reach their maximum size sooner, and that appears to increase their chance of dying. Trees that grow more quickly may also be more vulnerable to factors such as drought, disease and pests. When trees die, they give up their stored carbon gradually, in the form of methane, a greenhouse gas. This means that many standard climate change models of how we can use forests as carbon sinks, to absorb the carbon dioxide we produce from fossil fuel burning, are likely to overestimate the benefits. This study suggests that although the forests of the future might grow faster as temperatures increase, they could also store less carbon as the trees die off sooner. “Our findings indicate that there are traits within the fastest-growing trees that make them vulnerable, whereas slower-growing trees have traits that allow them to persist,” said Steve Voelker of the department of environmental and forest biology at Syracuse University New York, a co-author of the study. “[The] carbon uptake rates of forests are likely to be on the wane as slow-growing and persistent trees are supplanted by fast-growing but vulnerable trees.” David Lee, professor of atmospheric science at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was not involved in the study, said: “Currently, Earth system climate models predict continuation or increases in the size of the carbon sink of mature forests and this study shows the opposite, that increased CO2 compromises forests as a carbon sink … The idea that fossil fuel-based emissions can be offset by planting trees or avoiding deforestation really does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.” However, Keith Kirby, woodland ecologist at the University of Oxford, said the results did not negate the value of growing trees to stave off the climate crisis. “We cannot rely as much on increased growth per unit area to maintain and enhance the forest carbon sink potential, but this might be offset by slowing deforestation and increasing the expansion of the extent of forests, where this can be done in a sustainable way,” he said. For the study, the international team of scientists analysed data from more than 200,000 tree ring samples representing 110 species of tree, across all continents except for Africa and Antarctica. They found that faster growth was linked to shorter lifespans in trees of the same species, and across different species, and was not dependent on the climate or soil. The researchers also conducted a computer simulation, using data on the black spruce (Picea mariana), to see what impact faster growth would have on carbon storage. The results showed that the greater propensity for the trees to die off after growing more quickly could reduce the capacity of global forests to absorb and store carbon dioxide, as temperatures rose. Growing trees, and preserving existing forests, is one of the most important ways of staving off the worst impacts of the climate crisis. But several studies have cast doubt on the capacity of global forests to act as carbon sinks as the climate alters. A study published in March found that tropical forests were losing their ability to store carbon, and research published in May showed that the world’s forests were becoming shorter and younger."
"It is estimated that around one and a half billion people globally have no access to reliable electricity. Most live in developing countries where the cost of connecting rural villages to the electricity grid is, and will remain, prohibitively expensive. This is certainly the case in sub-Saharan Africa, where remote villages lie in huge expanses of territory, far from electrified towns and cities. The 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, comprising 800m people, generate power roughly equivalent to Spain, with a population of 45m. And, incredibly, this figure is falling. Building infrastructure in Africa is a major challenge, and electrifying the continent is perhaps the biggest of all. This challenge was the target of the our Energy for Development (E4D) programme. The aim is to set up and implement easy-to-replicate, sustainable, decentralised, off-grid electricity generation for rural communities, which requires overcoming various scientific, engineering, and policy questions challenges. A key aim was not just to electrify but to invigorate rural communities and village centres by providing a means to support self-governance, finance and entrepreneurship. The Kitonyoni village market solar project established in Makueni County, southeast Kenya, involved setting up a community-based, energy supply co-operative. This would operate an electricity mini-grid to distribute solar powered electricity. The mini-grid was designed to supply power to all buildings in the village centre, including shops, cafes, schools, health centres, and churches. To ensure the project is economically sustainable, the village community contributes to the co-operative and is responsible for running and maintaining the 13.5kW power plant. Income is generated by co-op membership fees, electricity sales and share ownership, and this covers all the running and maintenance costs. Surplus is also used to provide micro finance for the community, which helps to earn back the project’s initial capital cost. Obviously the constant supply of strong sunlight throughout the continent makes solar power ideal to tackle Africa’s power shortfall. But solar power appears most commonly as very small scale systems such as for individual household lighting or water pumping. Large scale projects are emerging however, for exmample the 250kW system in Kigali, Rwanda, and a 1MW plant due to open in December in Kericho County, Kenya, which will be the largest in East Africa. Energy policy in African states is variable, and suffers from lack of long term investment. Of the US$269 billion invested in renewable energy projects worldwide, only US$4.5 billion was in Africa. The new Kenyan energy policy issued last year, for example, outlines targets for renewable energy. But regardless, the high initial costs of equipment and lack of expertise has led solar power to be sidelined, national grids expanded to connect urban areas, and rural settlements overlooked. This is why one of the key aims of the E4D project was to design a modular system that could be easily delivered and customised to suit different villages, and one that would be viable through electricity charges and membership fees within the community, with no expectation of support from government. An estimated 3,000 local people will benefit from electricity provided in Kitonyoni. The school, health centre, and the 40 businesses in the village centre have stable, round-the-clock power supply, which allows them to open longer and provide extra services, such as IT training, tailoring and hair dressing that require electrical equipment. The canopy of the solar power system also collects rain, and the water is stored and sold by the cooperative year round. The project has undoubtedly transformed the village centre, the villagers’ lives, and has also provided the research team with a year’s data to better gauge the system’s performance. In a year, land prices have more than doubled, five new buildings have been completed, new businesses started, business income has (in most cases) more than doubled and, most importantly, a new maternity ward has been been electrified. The challenge now is to reduce capital costs and streamline the process of replicating the project elsewhere. A second project in Kenya and one in Cameroon are underway, with others planned in Mozambique and elsewhere in Africa. Visitors have come from as far afield as the UK, Japan, Germany, Zambia, and from institutions such as the the World Bank and the private sector. In most developing countries the cost of connecting the national grid to remote regions is too expensive. For rural areas, self-generation is the only viable option, with renewable off-grid solutions in most cases able to provide cheaper options with no fuel cost and low maintenance."
"Brenda Barnes, a   corporate chief executive whose decision to leave her top job at   sparked a national debate about women juggling career and family, died on Tuesday in Naperville, Ill. She was 63. Her daughter, Erin Barnes, said the cause was complications of a stroke. The elder Ms. Barnes had had a stroke in 2010, after which she gave up her corporate career entirely. Ms. Barnes had been chief executive of   North America for a year and a half when she decided in 1997 to step down, saying that after two decades of grueling hours away from home she wanted to spend time with her three children, ages 10, 8 and 7. She was 43 at the time and overseeing PepsiCo’s chief profit engine, based in Somers, N. Y. making her one of the most recognized women in corporate America. She resisted the entreaties of her peers to remain at the company, explaining that she had had her fill of days and nights away from her children. “I hope people can look at my decision not as ‘women can’t do it’ but ‘for 22 years Brenda gave her all and did a lot of great things,’” Ms. Barnes told The Wall Street Journal at the time. “I don’t think there’s any man who doesn’t have the same struggle. Hopefully, one day corporate America can battle this. ” Her choice and the blunt language she used to describe the many burdens executive women had to shoulder elicited sharp reactions. Supporters hailed her decision to put family first. Detractors argued that her retreat from such a lofty post was a defeat for women fighting to be considered men’s equals in the boardroom. The debate raged on television talk shows in the United States and in tabloid newspapers in London  —   much to the surprise of Ms. Barnes, who had never seen herself as a public figure pushing a cause. A private woman by disposition (her nickname growing up outside Chicago was Bashful) Ms. Barnes weathered the public outcry and returned to Illinois with her family, settling in Naperville, about 33 miles west of Chicago. She did not fully retire from corporate life, however. She became a   company director, joining the boards of The New York Times (from 1998 to 2008) Avon, Lucasfilm, Sears and Staples. In 2004, with her children in high school, Ms. Barnes accepted an offer to be a top executive at Sara Lee, the food conglomerate based in Chicago. She was soon named chairwoman and chief executive  —   becoming one of the few women to run a major American corporation  —   and given a mandate to revive Sara Lee’s sinking fortunes. Ms. Barnes presided over a broad corporate restructuring, selling off noncore businesses and focusing on the company’s food brands. But the overhaul did not spur a profit recovery, and Sara Lee’s stock price remained stagnant for much of her time there. Ms. Barnes’s stroke in 2010 came in May while she was lifting weights at a local gym. It left her incapable of simple motor activities. Three months later, at 56 and after a tough rehabilitation period, she stepped down permanently from Sara Lee. She did not return to corporate life again. Brenda Jo Czajka, a granddaughter of Polish immigrants, was born on Nov. 11, 1953, in Chicago and grew up in River Grove, Ill. a gritty suburb northwest of the city. Her father was a pipe fitter at International Harvester, the agricultural manufacturer her mother stayed home to look after Brenda and her six sisters. Ms. Barnes began working at 15, helping out at a neighborhood flower shop for $1. 25 per hour. (As chief executive of Sara Lee, she earned as much as $15 million a year.) She graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill. in 1975 with a major in economics. After stints waiting on tables and sorting mail, she landed a job in the back office of Wilson Sporting Goods in Chicago in 1976. Wilson was part of the   Pepsi conglomerate at the time, and Ms. Barnes began to climb the corporate ladder rapidly while working toward her master’s degree in business at Loyola University Chicago, receiving it in 1980. She then moved to a senior job marketing salty snacks at Pepsi’s   division in Dallas. Also in 1980, she married Randall Barnes, a top executive at the company. The marriage ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Ms. Barnes is survived by two sons, Jeff and Brian her partner, Sal Barrutia and five sisters, Linda Stebbins, Donna Williams, Rhonda Thompson, Laurna Czajka and Trina Baker. Another sister, Andra, died before her. In more than 20 years with Pepsi, Ms. Barnes rose from one top job to another, moving from marketing positions to broader management roles until she was named to run the company’s giant beverage business in North America in 1996. She gained a reputation for being adept at connecting with workers on the factory floor and for wooing her peers in the boardroom. But the hours were brutal. She often set her alarm for 3:30 a. m. she said, so she could catch up with work at home before rousing the children for school. “There were two things in my life, kids and job,” Ms. Barnes told The Christian Science Monitor. “Exercise? Golf? Sleep? None of that. ”"

"DAKAR, Senegal  —   Four days into his term, tucked into a sofa 150 miles outside the country he was elected to rule, President Adama Barrow of Gambia pledged on Sunday to improve his country’s economy, free its political prisoners and create a commission to look into the brutal legacy of his predecessor. But first he has to get home. Mr. Barrow, 51, has been stuck in neighboring Senegal for a week, waiting for the incumbent he defeated, Yahya Jammeh, to step down and leave the country. After initially accepting his loss in the December presidential election, Mr. Jammeh reversed himself, called for a new vote and refused to give up power when his term ended on Thursday. Afraid for his safety, Mr. Barrow fled to Senegal and was sworn in during an inauguration at the Gambian Embassy in Dakar. A coalition of other African countries sent troops into Gambia to evict Mr. Jammeh by force if necessary, and on Saturday night, Mr. Jammeh finally let go. He boarded a plane headed for exile, accompanied by the president of Guinea, who had gone to Gambia to persuade him to leave. Mr. Jammeh’s first stop was Conakry, Guinea. But it was not clear where his final new home would be. The departure paved the way for Mr. Barrow to take over, but on Sunday afternoon, he was still at a house he owns in Dakar, trying to sort out the details of his return home. It could take several days yet security advisers were scheduled to go to Banjul, the capital, on Monday to assess the situation and prepare for his safe arrival.   after having awakened late in the morning, the unassuming president sank into a giant couch that seemed to absorb him, and spoke of his hopes for his administration. “Gambia is back again,” said Mr. Barrow, who wore a shiny brown traditional gown and leather sandals. “We have been isolated for so many years, and we want Gambia to be very active again in this world. ” Mr. Jammeh, who took office after a 1994 coup, imprisoned numerous journalists and political opponents during his tenure, some of whom died in jail. His rule was erratic, and made headlines for his claim to have cured AIDS with herbs, a prayer and a banana he also called for beheading gay people. His actions prompted thousands of Gambians to flee the country, and the nation’s weak economy prompted hundreds more to try to make the dangerous trek across the desert and the Mediterranean to look for work in Europe. More recently, an estimated 45, 000 Gambians had rushed across the border to Senegal, fearing violence if Mr. Jammeh were forcibly removed from office, and causing the United Nations to worry about a humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, many of those Gambians began to return home. Officials released a joint declaration by the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States on Sunday that “assures and ensures the dignity, respect, security and rights” of Mr. Jammeh, his family and his loyal supporters, so that “there is no intimidation, harassment     of former regime members and supporters. ” The document, which refers to Mr. Jammeh by his preferred honorifics  —   H. E. (for “his excellency”) Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  —   goes on to say that the organizations that issued the report are committed to preventing the seizure of assets of Mr. Jammeh and his family and loyalists. And it says the organizations will work to ensure that in whichever countries offer “African hospitality” to Mr. Jammeh and his family, they do not “become undue targets of harassment, intimidation and all other pressures and sanctions. ” Mr. Barrow said he had planned to create a truth and reconciliation commission to look into the Jammeh government. He said he would wait for the commission’s recommendations before taking action. “It’s a resolution it’s not an agreement,” Mr. Barrow said of the document. Until last fall, Mr. Barrow ran a real estate agency in Gambia and was a fairly   member of an opposition party. But Mr. Jammeh began to jail the party’s leaders, and Mr. Barrow found himself rising from the vacuum, assuming the party’s candidacy for president and winning a surprise victory over the authoritarian Mr. Jammeh. Mr. Barrow said on Sunday that his chief priority would be to work on improving the economy in Gambia, where there is widespread unemployment. But he offered no specifics, saying instead that he would assemble a team of experts to figure out how to get the economy back on track. He said he had planned to release anyone imprisoned in Gambia for political reasons, a hallmark of Mr. Jammeh’s presidency and one that alienated him from human rights groups and many Western democracies. “Political prisoners will be freed immediately when I get home,” Mr. Barrow said. “All political prisoners. ” While a great many people in Gambia will welcome Mr. Barrow when he finally returns, Mr. Jammeh still has supporters. Many turned out in tears Saturday night to bid him farewell at the Banjul airport, where he arrived in his  . Mr. Barrow said he did not think Mr. Jammeh’s loyalists would present problems for his administration. On Sunday, some Gambians were appalled at the pomp that accompanied Mr. Jammeh on his way out. A military band showed up at the airport to play for him as he walked along a red carpet to a waiting airplane. “That man should have left this country in handcuffs,” said Alpha Gaye, a taxi driver in Serekunda, just west of the capital. “I will be very angry if Yahya Jammeh goes without punishment. He should die in jail. ”"
"When Jane Fonda was arrested in Washington DC last December, days shy of her 82nd birthday, there was an overwhelming sense of history repeating, and not just because this was the fifth time she had been arrested in almost as many weeks. Fonda was taking part in her very public – and ongoing, albeit now online – protest against what she sees as the US government’s criminal inertia over the climate crisis. When he heard about Fonda’s arrests, President Donald Trump crowed to a rally: “They arrested Jane Fonda – nothing changes! I remember 30, 40 years ago they arrested her. She’s always got the handcuffs on, oh man.” Trump was partially right, although he underestimated the time. Fonda was first arrested in 1970; half a century later she is still protesting, still being arrested and still being mocked by US presidents. On Richard Nixon’s notorious White House tapes, he can be heard discussing Fonda in 1971, dismissing her even more public protests against US involvement in the Vietnam war. “Jane Fonda. What in the world is the matter with Jane Fonda?” he said. “I feel so sorry for Henry Fonda, who’s a nice man. She’s a great actress. She looks pretty. But boy, she’s often on the wrong track.” Less than a year later, Nixon would be taped plotting the Watergate cover-up. Someone should tell Trump that Fonda has an excellent track record of winning the long game, and that her critics don’t. Still, being derided by the most powerful people on the planet must take some getting used to. Does Fonda ever feel scared? “The fear part – I don’t know why this is true, but I am very rarely afraid. I’ve been in all kinds of situations: I’ve been shot at, I’ve had bombs dropped on me; but I tend not to be afraid. Maybe emotional intimacy scares me. That’s where my fear lives,” she says from her home in Los Angeles, with a self-mocking laugh. My fear lives, a tiny bit, in the prospect of interviewing Fonda, precisely because she is so fearless. The first time she was arrested, it was because officials insisted the vitamins in her suitcase were illegal drugs. “I’m taking orders from Washington!” one of the customs officials shouted at her – yet she was so undaunted she raised and clenched her fist in her still iconic mugshot. What was she thinking when they took that photograph? “Defiance,” she replies firmly, and adds, “I’m just glad the lighting was good!”  How does she feel when she looks at the notorious photographs of her in Hanoi in 1972, sitting behind an enemy anti-aircraft gun as if she were about to shoot down US planes, which led to decades of vilification. “I want to throw up. I understand why that girl… why that happened. But it just sickens me, the whole thing. But do I regret going? No, never. It was the most life-altering experience I could ever, ever have.” She apologised a long time ago for sitting behind the North Vietnamese guns, but continued to protest against the war, even though people demonstrated outside her films for years to come. She has won two Oscars (for Klute and Coming Home), but Fonda’s extraordinary life has, for many, long overshadowed her career. To some, she will for ever be Hanoi Jane; for others, she is the queen of aerobics. To this day, Jane Fonda’s Workout remains one of the biggest-selling home videos ever. But Fonda only made it to raise money for the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), the non-profit organisation she ran with her second husband, the radical left-wing firebrand Tom Hayden. Wealthy housewives doing pelvic thrusts to the Workout had no idea they were contributing to a cause that wasn’t a million miles from socialism, and Fonda raised more than $17m for the CED. (In classic man-of-the-left style, Hayden occasionally made “disparaging remarks” about the Workout. “I would just think, OK, I’m vain. [But] where else would you have got $17m?” Fonda writes in her 2005 memoir, My Life So Far.) As if to prove how little things change, during lockdown Fonda has been making workout TikToks to raise awareness of her environmental protests, still exercising for activism at 82. “It’s fun and it attracts a younger demographic, doing TikTok,” she says, with the breeziness of one fully fluent in social media. Fonda still looks astonishingly like her father and, with those high cheekbones and dark brows, she has the demeanour – as Henry did – of someone who does not suffer fools. “In addition to being funny and fun, boy is she ever honest, frank, available and a total straight shooter,” Sam Waterston, her co-star in the excellent sitcom Grace And Frankie tells me.  Fonda has a new book out, called What Can I Do? I tried to count the number of books she has published and I think it’s a dozen, but neither of us is sure. On the surface, they seem a somewhat random mix, from a guide to being a teenage girl to the Workout books. But every one is underpinned by Fonda’s activism. Being A Teen was partially born out of her work with her foundation, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential (GCAPP), set up in the 90s to help reduce the state’s high rates of teen pregnancy. The Workout books were Das Kapital smuggled inside a leotard (sort of). While it is easy to mock celebrity activism, no one can doubt Fonda’s bona fides; she has been shouting about the environment since the 1960s, after learning that car emissions damaged the atmosphere. But why keep doing it? Why endure prison with its metal slab of a bed (“I’m quite bony, so that was painful,” she admits) instead of enjoying a nice, quiet life in her ninth decade? “Oh my God, for my own sanity! Last year, I was going insane, I was so depressed, knowing things were falling apart and I wasn’t doing enough. Once I decided what to do, all that dropped away,” she says. What Can I Do? is a how-to guide and memoir of her protest campaign, known as Fire Drill Friday. This took place in Washington DC every Friday in late 2019, and led to the arrest of Fonda and many of her celebrity friends, including Waterston. “When we heard what she was planning, we all volunteered,” he says. “Jane is one of those people who walks toward the fire. She’s out to make a difference.” It takes more than a global plague to break Fonda’s stride, and her first online climate protest was so popular the website crashed. “Can you believe it, a quarter of a million people follow us! This is not what I expected. I’m so busy, I can spend the entire day sitting at my desk on Zoom meetings. I need to go back to work so I can have more time,” she says, referring to Grace And Frankie, which starts shooting again this autumn. In her book, Fonda details her endearingly earnest attempts to get to grips with the climate crisis. But my favourite moments are when she laughs at herself, such as when she catches up on her wall squats in prison (“Hey, you gotta seize the opportunity”). “Well, there’s a lot to laugh at! If I didn’t laugh at myself I’d be crying,” she says. In January 2018, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram, looking distinctly bedraggled in a designer evening dress she had worn the night before. “Here’s me the next morning. I couldn’t get my dress unzipped so I slept in it… Never wanted a husband in my life until now,” she wrote. “Haha, you saw that?” she cackles. I not only saw it, I discussed it with Dolly Parton, Fonda’s co-star in 9 to 5, when I interviewed her last year. She said she admired it, but would never do that herself. “I thought it was cute, but no, never!” she gasped. “Ha! That doesn’t surprise me. I once spent 10 days with Dolly on her tour bus and never saw her without full regalia,” Fonda says, laughing. Parton and I also talked about the time she, Fonda and their other 9 to 5 co-star, Lily Tomlin, presented an award at the 2017 Emmys, with an on-the-nose swipe at Donald Trump. “Back in 1980 in [9 to 5], we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,” said Fonda. “And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,” added Tomlin. The audience cheered and Parton – doubtless thinking of her southern Republican fanbase – went wide-eyed with alarm. “I just did not want everybody to think that whatever Lily and Jane think is what I think,” Parton later told me. “I don’t really like getting up on TV and saying political things.” I ask Fonda if she and Tomlin had taken Parton by surprise. “Oh no, we planned it before. But I think [Parton] got a reaction and that’s what upset her. I don’t think she thought at the time about that reaction,” says Fonda blithely, unintentionally getting her co-star into trouble again. *** Whenever Fonda tells her life story, she has to start with her father, Henry. A second world war veteran, he was regarded by the public as an American hero, the only actor who could have played both Tom Joad in The Grapes Of Wrath and Davis, the truth-seeking juror in 12 Angry Men. In her memoir, Fonda writes that her father once “kicked in the television set” when the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings were being broadcast. Yet, she adds, he didn’t join other celebrities who flew to Washington DC, where the HUAC hearing were taking place, to publicly support the writers and directors accused of communist sympathies, known as the Hollywood Ten. Given how political she is, does Fonda find that strange in retrospect? “Oh no. For him, voting for the Democratic candidate who promised to end the war was what he felt comfortable doing. And he did that. It was a generational thing, I think,” Fonda says protectively. (I don’t have the heart to point out that others of Henry’s generation spoke out against HUAC, including Humphrey Bogart and John Huston.) But she revered her father and felt “in his shadow for years”. It was a long shadow, even if Henry was occasionally more of a theoretical than actual presence during her childhood, leaving her, her younger brother, Peter, and their mother, Frances, for work and, later, for other women. When Fonda was 12, her mother killed herself. Soon afterwards, Henry dispatched his children to boarding school; he and Jane never spoke about Frances again. Fonda spent much of her life trying to get her father to see things from her perspective, with limited success. Her Vietnam protests were an especial source of rancour between them. “I tried to make him understand. He just couldn’t. I told him what I was hearing from soldiers who had been in Vietnam about the atrocities. He had said, ‘If you can prove to me this is true, I will lead a demonstration to the White House.’ So I brought in a Green Beret who talked to him about it – but still he just couldn’t. It wasn’t his style,” she says. I ask if she ever rewatches On Golden Pond, the 1981 movie in which the Fondas play an emotionally reserved father and headstrong daughter. “On Golden Pond? I rewatch it all the time. And I… ” Fonda breaks off, sobbing. “God, even talking about it!” she begins, but has to stop again. I tell her I’m so sorry: I didn’t mean to make her cry. “Oh, that’s OK. Nothing wrong with crying,” she says. Exercise was for me a healthy way to control my body in a way I couldn’t do otherwise I tell her I always cry at On Golden Pond, too, and always at the scene when the daughter touches her father’s arm and he looks down, as if suppressing tears. (In Fonda’s memoir, she says she improvised that gesture, and that her father’s tears were real.) “Oh God, I know. I’m just the luckiest person in the world. The fact that I was able to do that movie with him right before he died, because he died five months later,” she says, choking up again. Both Fondas were nominated for Oscars for the film, but only Henry won, his first and last Academy Award. He was too ill to attend the ceremony, so Fonda accepted it on his behalf. It was, she has said, “the happiest moment of my life”. It is a testament to Henry’s influence that both Fonda and her brother, Peter, went into acting (as did Peter’s daughter, Bridget, and Fonda and Hayden’s son, Troy Garity.) Peter died last year at the age of 79. Were they close? “Yes and no. We were very different. I didn’t see a lot of him. I didn’t even know that he was sick. But he eventually sent me an email and said what hospital he was in, a few weeks before he died. I went there almost every day, and we would laugh and laugh. I’m so grateful that that’s how it was at the end between us.” As much as she adored her father, Fonda is clear-eyed about him. “Dad had an obsession with women being thin. Once I hit adolescence, the only time my father ever referred to how I looked was when he thought I was too fat,” she writes in her memoir. She learned from an early age that if she didn’t show hurt or need, she would be praised for being strong; she learned so well that, even when her mother died, she didn’t cry. But pain resists repression. At boarding school, Fonda embarked on a 30-year struggle with bulimia, finally kicking it in her 40s. I tell her I, too, developed an eating disorder as a teenager, and that I’m grateful to her for talking about how long it really takes to recover. “Oh yeah – years! It was so hard to do. I remember Jason Robards, who had been a terrible alcoholic, talking about the third step of the AA programme, the higher power. And I always thought, what a lot of bullshit. I discovered later, that it is true,” she says. So it was faith that finally helped her stop being bulimic? “It was a combination of a lot of things. Part of it was willpower, but it happened more when I received a spirit. I was suffering terribly and – God, this is so weird to say to the Guardian! – but I was alone in my house and I had really hit bottom. I said out loud, ‘There must be a reason that God wants me to suffer like this.’ And I looked around and said, ‘Who said that? I’m an atheist!’ I always wanted to date someone who was the opposite of my father. I didn’t realise I picked men who were just like him “But right at that time, everything began to change. I’d had an epiphany, I could feel it happening in my body. I could feel myself coming together and being one person. You know, it’s like you look at a double exposure and slowly the doubleness comes together and they sit perfectly. That’s what happened. It’s the absence of that which causes the anxiety that leads to eating disorders,” she says. In 2001, Fonda became a Christian. “But how about you? Are you OK now?” she asks. I tell her I’m fine, although it wasn’t a higher power that helped: it was having kids – suddenly there were people who needed me to eat. I apologise for how unfeminist that must sound. “No! Not at all. It’s totally true, I get it,” she says with feeling. Fonda’s recovery from bulimia was closely followed by her embrace of aerobics. Was she swapping one form of body obsession for another? “I think exercise was for me a healthy way to control my body in a way I couldn’t do otherwise,” she says. She has talked in the past about having facelifts and breast implants. Was the plastic surgery another way to punish her body? “Oh yeah, plastic surgery, that’s interesting. Well, no matter what I do, I’m stuck with this [idea]: if you don’t look right, you’re not going to be loved. So I always wanted to try to look right. I think when you’re poor you cut yourself, and when you’re rich you have plastic surgery,” she says. *** As an adult, Fonda swapped one dominating male figure for three: her husbands. When she was with the film director Roger Vadim, who was previously married to Brigitte Bardot, she became a Bardot-esque sex kitten in Barbarella and engaged in threesomes with him, eventually leaving him after the birth of their daughter, Vanessa. Married to Hayden, she took to the barricades with him. When she married media mogul Ted Turner in 1991, she swapped her off-grid life for that of a billionaire’s wife. “I always wanted to date someone who was the opposite of my father,” she explains. “I didn’t realise that, in the ways that really mattered, I picked men who were just like him because they all had a hard time with intimacy.” Fonda says she and her father never talked about her mother because she was scared of hurting him, and that she also struggled to express her feelings to her husbands. And yet she was out loudly campaigning for American GIs to come home from Vietnam, for girls to have better sex education, for indigenous fishing rights. “Yes, but that was an external courage. It wasn’t about my heart,” she says. I had read Fonda’s memoir directly before reading What Can I Do?, and it was jarring to go from her tales of near daily private jets with Turner, to urgent warnings about the environment. Does she have regrets about that period of her life? There is a long pause. “I wouldn’t have given up a moment of it, for anything. I mean, he owns two million acres, OK? I used to try to imagine what they would be if he hadn’t been able to buy them. There would be, how many McMansions? He saved all this land and the only way he could get around to them all was to have his own plane. So I didn’t mind it,” she says. Instead of slogging it out with all these protests and arrests, why not ask Turner to donate, say, half a billion dollars to environmental causes? Surely that would achieve at least as much. It’s the most exciting thing in the world to keep learning! It’s more important to be interested than to be interesting “Yes, um, I have not asked him. He has a family foundation and, you know, all family foundations have hit hard times now. So no, I don’t go to him for money,” she says in the careful, ever-so-slightly strained voice she uses whenever we talk about Turner. Their relationship sounds if not controlling then certainly restrictive, with Turner scheduling every hour of their days months in advance. He insisted she always be by his side, and Fonda made no films during their marriage, which ended when she left him in 2001. He then flew her in his private plane from his ranch to Atlanta, Georgia. His new girlfriend, who – unbeknown to Fonda – had been waiting in the airport, flew back with him to his ranch in Fonda’s still-warm seat. In the past, Fonda has said that she allied herself to strong men because she felt so unsure of herself. But isn’t it more likely that she needed strong people because she is an extraordinarily strong character herself? “Oh yeah, whenever I’ve been with men who are not strong I’ve had a really hard time,” she agrees. “I’m now five years older than my dad was when he died and I’ve realised that I am, in fact, stronger than he was. I’m stronger than all the men that I’ve been married to.” These days, Fonda is firmly single. “[That part of my life] is gone. I can tell. It’s just over – I’ve closed up shop. I’m extremely happy on my own,” she says. A common refrain in her memoir is that she allowed her husbands to shape her too much because of her “disease to please”. Another way to look at it is that she is just admirably open to new experiences: with Vadim, she embodied the sexual experimentation of the 1960s; with Hayden, 1970s activism; and with Turner, the monied life of the new 1990s elite. Now she is eagerly learning from a new generation of activists. Shortly before our interview, she posted on Instagram a speech she made with Patrisse Cullors, one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter; during lockdown she has hosted Fire Drill Friday events with trans activists. “Oh, it’s the most exciting thing in the world, to keep learning!” she says. “It’s one of my mantras: it’s more important to be interested than to be interesting. I feel like a student and that’s really good. All these young people are so good at knowing what to do and not to do, what to say and what not to say, and they provide tremendous insight. I’m just learning so much every day and it makes me so happy. It’s a whole new chapter.” • What Can I Do?

"Here is another Monument to the Madness of CCB (carbon capture and burial) – it needs a lot of  energy – currently estimated to require 30% of the output of a power station.
So in order to satisfy the existing market for electricity, we would have to build a new power station for every three existing ones just to provide the power to capture and bury, not just the CO2 from the existing ones, but also from the new one as well.
Most coal fired power stations are about 33% efficient. Put simply, they burn 3 tonnes of coal to get the equivalent energy of 1 tonne. With CCB, they will now burn 4 tonnes of coal and increase CO2 emissions by 33% for the same useful output.
If however we spend the money required for CCB on increasing the efficiency of thermal power stations even to a modest 50%, they would only need to burn 2 tonnes of coal to get the equivalent energy of 1 tonne and that alone will reduce CO2 emissions by 33%.
Combined cycle is already at 50% and China has been developing super critical boiler temperatures which they claim will be 50% efficient.
But what does Government do? They introduce a tax, as a solution which may not work, for a problem which may not exist.

"SAN FRANCISCO  —   On Snapchat last week, MTV published an article with the headline “Is this the thirstiest person on earth?” The article, which ran on Snapchat’s news service, Discover, appeared with a picture of a   blond woman taking a selfie, even though the piece was about a fully clothed man. Those kinds of risqué and misleading images will now be much less prominent on Discover because early on Monday, Snapchat updated its guidelines for publishers in a way that essentially cleans up what is shown on its news service. The new rules more explicitly restrict publishers from posting questionable pictures on Discover that do not have news or editorial value. Snapchat also clarified guidelines that prevent publishers from including reports or links to outside websites that could be considered fake news, saying that all content must be   and accurate. The changes aim to “empower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative, factual and safe environment for everyone,” said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for the company. Snapchat said it also planned to give publishers a tool in February that would allow them to   content, or stop minors from seeing some content altogether. The moves  —   which come ahead of an initial public offering expected for this spring by Snapchat’s parent company, Snap  —   underscore how the company is trying to distinguish itself from rival social media services. Facebook and Twitter typically give users, including publications, wide latitude in what they can post, which has led the companies into one controversy after another  —   including criticism over fake news and outrage over harassment and abuse by internet trolls. Snapchat is   acting to limit those problems in a way that is reminiscent of how traditional media companies curate what they show people. “Snapchat thinks about the role that its content plays in the lives of consumers differently,” said Steven Kydd, one of the founders of Tastemade, an online food publication. “This is cable all over again, except for a mobile and global audience. ” Cleaning up what is published on Discover could have many benefits for Snapchat, like helping the service appeal to advertisers, which would not have to worry as much that they would be advertising alongside inappropriate content for Snapchat’s primary audience of teenagers and  . The new rules could also whet investors’ appetites for Snapchat if they help the company avoid the taints of fake news and online abuse that have dogged its rivals. “In this environment, every technology company that touches media is concerned about being vulnerable to connections to fake news and disinformation,” said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “That’s doubly true for a company planning for an I. P. O. ” Snapchat introduced Discover in January 2015 as a part of its mobile app, where it publishes content from established media brands like CNN and Cosmopolitan, as well as newer outlets like the political channel We the People. For Snapchat, Discover is a way to engage users more deeply. Publishers see Discover as an avenue to reach a new and younger audience. From the start, Snapchat approached news differently from other social networks. While Facebook has said it is not a media company and does not want to be an arbiter of truth in news on its website, Snapchat has long prohibited false or deceptive content and is thoroughly involved in editorial standards for content on Discover. In a blog post published when Discover began, Snapchat said: “Social media companies tell us what to read based on what’s most recent or most popular. We see it differently. We count on editors and artists, not clicks and shares, to determine what’s important. ” As a result, Snapchat has always exercised a large degree of control over Discover. To secure a place on Discover, publishers have had to agree to fairly stringent guidelines around editing and video production, including having audio play at a consistent volume and a ban on images that are misleading or gimmicky. Snapchat also mandated that all images and headlines be appropriate for an audience as young as 13 years old. Discover has grown quickly. More than 100 million Snapchat users view content on Discover each month, according to the company. While some publishers said people were initially slow to embrace Discover, interest has increased over the past year. Tastemade, which publishes different editions for different areas around the world on Discover, said it had been pleased enough with the size of its Snapchat audience that it planned to grow with Snapchat as it rolled out worldwide. Still, Snapchat has not been able to entirely sidestep criticism about what it shows on Discover. In July, a   lawsuit filed against the company alleged that Discover intentionally exposed minors “to harmful, offensive, prurient and sexually offensive content without warning minors or their parents that they would be exposed to such explicit content. ” The lawsuit cited examples of inappropriate content on Discover, like a post from BuzzFeed that sexualized images from Disney movies and a post from Cosmopolitan, with photos, about a performance artist who let strangers touch her genitalia. While the lawsuit was dismissed in November because the sides agreed to settle, Snapchat said it had decided to take action in response to the litigation. It soon created a new tool, which Snapchat said it had been discussing for a while, that let publishers prevent Snapchat users who were under age 18 from seeing certain content. When people sign up for Snapchat, they must enter their age and a phone number that is confirmed by the service. Snapchat also reserves the right to gate content for youngsters, even if a publisher has chosen not to do so. In updating its publisher guidelines, Snapchat aimed to clarify vague language and provide more examples around its restrictions on the use of nudity, profanity and violent images. The new rules more clearly state that publishers should not use overly sexualized or violent images as the initial visual that users are exposed to when they look at Discover and that content intended simply to shock or disgust is not allowed. Some exceptions are made for   material that has news value. For the first time, the guidelines have a dedicated section detailing the warnings that publishers must run when graphic images are deemed newsworthy, as well as when to   that content. Some of these updates came out of conversations that began months ago with several publishers that routinely published racier content, including The Daily Mail and Cosmopolitan, as well as news services that published controversial images. “We have been collaborating closely with all of our publishers, whose content has continued to evolve,” said Nick Bell, Snapchat’s vice president for content. “We want to be a great partner to all of our editorial partners, and updating our content guidelines to better reflect where our platform is today is an important part of that. ” One of the publishers that talked with Snapchat about the new rules was Sweet, a   channel created by the media company Hearst, which said its viewership on Discover had grown substantially over the past few months. Ross Clark, Sweet’s general manager and vice president, likened the updated guidelines to a parental advisory sticker on an album or to ratings on movies. “The media industry has always included clearly established content guidelines,” Mr. Clark said. “It’s what allows a platform to have a large, diverse set of users. ”"
"**Britain will change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong ""a route to citizenship"" if China imposes new security laws, Boris Johnson has said.**
Writing in the Times, Mr Johnson said the UK would ""have no choice"" but to uphold its ties with the territory.
China is facing mounting criticism over its planned law.
Many people in Hong Kong fear it could end their unique freedoms, which the rest of China does not have.
The UK is already in talks with allies including the US and Australia about what to do if China imposes the new law - which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority - and people start fleeing Hong Kong.
In the Times on Wednesday, the prime minister confirmed that if China passes the law, people in Hong Kong who hold British National (Overseas) (BNO) passports will be allowed to come to the UK for 12 months without a visa. Currently they are allowed to come for six months.
Around 350,000 people in Hong Kong currently already have a BNO passport, but 2.6 million others are also eligible.
Passport-holders would also be given further immigration rights, including the right to work.
This ""could place them on a route to citizenship,"" Mr Johnson said.
The prime minister added that the immigration changes ""would amount to one of the biggest changes in our visa system in British history"".
""If it proves necessary, the British government will take this step and take it willingly.
""Many people in Hong Kong fear their way of life, which China pledged to uphold, is under threat.
""If China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honour our obligations and provide an alternative.""
The last British governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the offer of support from the UK government was ""morally and politically right"".
He accused China's ruling Communist Party of employing ""bullying"" tactics, adding: ""Sooner or later with a bully you have to stand up to them, otherwise you'll get knocked about.""
Asked whether the UK was entering a new Cold War with China, Lord Patten told the BBC's World at One: ""I think we're entering a period of realism with China...
""This is not us against China, it's the way in which the Chinese Communist regime can't stand us, and they've cracked down on Hong Kong because it represents all the things which [President] Xi Jinping dislikes.""
Hong Kong is a former British colony. It was handed back to China in 1997.
As part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in mainland China - and these are set out in a mini-constitution called the Basic Law.
BNO passports were granted to all Hong Kong citizens born before the Chinese handover in 1997 and while they allow the holder some protection from the UK foreign service they do not currently give the right to live or work in Britain.
There has been widespread international criticism of China's proposed law and the UK government's announcement marks a step up in Britain's opposition to it.
On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was in talks with countries in the Five Eyes alliance about how to handle a potential ""exodus"" of people from the area.
He urged China to reconsider its plans which, he said, would threaten Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity.
Senior MPs from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have urged the United Nations to appoint a special envoy to Hong Kong to monitor how the new law affects human rights.
Earlier this week, seven former UK foreign secretaries urged Mr Johnson to form a global alliance to co-ordinate a response."
"**Seven former UK foreign secretaries have urged Boris Johnson to form a global alliance to co-ordinate the response to the China-Hong Kong crisis.**
China is facing mounting criticism over a planned security law for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would not turn a blind eye.
Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 but under a unique agreement.
The former British colony enjoys some freedoms not seen in mainland China - and these are set out in a mini-constitution called the Basic Law.
But there are fears the proposed law, which has sparked protests in Hong Kong, could compromise some of the freedoms guaranteed by the Basic Law.
In their letter to the prime minister, the cross-party group of former cabinet ministers says the UK government must be seen to lead the international response, as many countries take their cue from Britain over its former colony.
Jeremy Hunt, David Miliband, Jack Straw, William Hague, Malcolm Rifkind, David Owen and Margaret Beckett all expressed their concern at what they call China's ""flagrant breach"" of Sino-British agreements by imposing tough national security laws on Hong Kong.
They urged Mr Johnson to set up an ""international contact group"" of allies to coordinate any joint action, similar to that set up in 1994 to try to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
A Downing Street spokesman insisted the government was already playing a leading role with international partners in urging China to think again.
Mr Raab said the new security legislation ""very clearly violates"" the autonomy that is guaranteed under Chinese law as well as that in the 1997 agreement.
He confirmed the UK will allow those who hold British National (Overseas) (BNO) passports to come to the UK and apply to study and work for an extendable 12-month period.
This will in turn ""provide a path to citizenship"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.
BNO passports were granted to Hong Kong citizens born before the Chinese handover in 1997 and while they allow the holder some protection from the UK foreign service they do not give the right to live or work in Britain.
Mr Raab said up to three million people registered as a British national (overseas) in Hong Kong could be eligible for UK citizenship if China presses ahead with the law.
Meanwhile, the chairman of Commons foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the government must realise that China has a ""very, very authoritarian system of government"" and should rethink the partnership between the two."

The “climate crisis” crowd have been notably silent, ever since the Xi Plague broke out. It’s a bit hard, after all, to stage attention-seeking tanties like glueing yourself to the road when the country is in lockdown. Apparently it took a real crisis to silence the incessant yammering of the media climate cult, too.



But, just to prove there’s no show without Punch, at least one mob of “progressive” vultures are all over the COVID-19 pandemic like viruses on a bat.



About 65 refugees detained in a Melbourne hotel launched a daily protest against their incarceration during the pandemic.



Of course, they did. There’s nothing these grifters won’t stoop to in order to force their way into Australia. It’s telling that their spokesman is one of the dozens who wormed their way off Manus during the [“Medevac” debacle](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/medivac-illegal-immigrant-con-exposed/).



Afghan refugee **Hakeem Kakar** is among the men in Brisbane brought to Australia for medical treatment[…]



“We should be free, we should be released in the community for self-solation. This is not self-isolation,” Mr Kakar said.



“They are closing the clubs, the bars, the pubs, the gyms, everything… but what about here? We are like some kind of animals?”



Well, you were nicely isolated, back in Manus. Maybe go back there?



A guard who worked at the Brisbane hotel has tested positive for Covid-19[…]



Security firm Serco told SBS News the guard had not been in contact with any refugees for 11 days prior to diagnosis.



But Mr Kakar said some of the refugees had symptoms yet were told they could not be tested.



“I have some friends here, they’re coughing and some of them have fever,” he said.



Hmm. Just like they had “stomach pains” that supposedly needed urgent treatment in Australia…yet, they refused examination or treatment the instant they landed here.



Naturally, the same kind of professional idiots who were responsible for the Medevac farce have to have their two-cents worth.



The Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases and the Australian College of Infection Prevention and Control have backed the refugees’ call for release.



In a joint statement, the peak professional bodies said the refugees should be placed in the community.



Thankfully, the government is standing firm.



But the government told SBS News it would not release prisoners from immigration detention.

CREDIT ORNL
OAK RIDGE, Tenn., June 29, 2016 — A multinational team led by the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory Climate Change Science Institute has found the first positive correlation between human activity and enhanced vegetation growth.
The research team, led by Jiafu Mao of the Ecosystem Simulation Science group in the Environmental Sciences Division, used new environmental data and strict statistical methods to discover a significant human-vegetation interaction in the northern extratropical latitudes, the section of the planet spanning 30 to 75 degrees north, roughly between the Tropic of Cancer and the North Frigid Zone above the Arctic Circle.
“This is the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes at the continental scale,” Mao said.
With the absence of long-term observational records and suitable Earth system model (ESM) simulations, the human “touch” on northern latitude greening had not been previously identified. The team used two recently available 30-year-long leaf area index data sets, 19 ESM simulations and a formal “detection and attribution” statistical algorithm to positively attribute changes in vegetation activity in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere to anthropogenic forcings, or human-induced climate inputs such as well-mixed greenhouse gas emissions.
Leaf area index — the ratio of leaf surface area to ground area — is an indicator of vegetation growth and productivity derived from satellite imaging. The remote-sensing-based LAI datasets and ESM simulations showed a significant “greening” trend over the northern extratropical latitudes vegetated area between 1982 and 2011, indicating increased vegetative productivity.
When Mao and his colleagues accounted for internal climate variability and responses to natural forcings such as volcanic eruptions and incoming solar radiation, it was clear that the greening was inconsistent with simulations of purely natural factors and could only be explained by anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcings, particularly elevated carbon dioxide concentrations.
This anthropogenic greening effect has the potential to alter natural processes on a planetary scale. Continent-wide changes in vegetative productivity, such as those in the study, impact energy exchanges, water use and carbon budgets, accelerating or slowing the pace of climate change.
Accurate detection and attribution of changes in vegetation growth patterns are essential for strategic decision-making in ecosystem management, agricultural applications and sustainable development and conservation. This is the first time the detection and attribution algorithm has been applied to terrestrial ecosystem changes such as leaf area index trends, as it is typically used to study physical climate data such as extreme events and variations in temperature or precipitation.
Mao would like to see these long-term regional- and global-scale observational data sets used in similar studies as they become available. He says the detection and attribution algorithm could be applied to study broad-scale terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, and the framework developed for this study could be used to identify and correct potential errors in next-generation ESM simulations.

The study and its results are reported in the article “Human-induced greening of the northern extratropical land surface” in Nature Climate Change. Other ORNL participants and coauthors were Xiaoying Shi, Peter Thornton, Dan Ricciuto and Forrest Hoffman.

Guest post by David Middleton


The Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil on Thursday, arguing that the company is violating several key water regulations at one of their Boston storage and transfer locations.
The site in question — located in the Boston suburb of Everett, Massachusetts — is a sprawling, 110-acre terminal that extends to the bank of the Mystic River. The complaint alleges that the terminal has released toxic pollutants into the water for years, and that the company has failed to make improvements to the terminal to strengthen it against the risks of climate change — violating both the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
“This is a stunning example of how ExxonMobil’s climate deceit hits home, where their repeated sworn, but false, statements to regulators that this facility was prepared for climate conditions put the surrounding communities that have hosted the facility for years in danger,” Brad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation, told ThinkProgress.
According to investigative reports published last year by both InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, ExxonMobil’s internal scientists knew about the role of fossil fuels in driving global warming as early as 1977, and yet publicly continued to fuel doubt about climate science.
Exxon also built oil rigs in the North Sea to withstand projected climate impacts like sea level rise and rising temperatures.
Yet the company failed to make the same structural improvements to its terminal in Massachusetts, the lawsuit claims, leaving surrounding communities at risk of toxic pollution during severe storm events or floods. According to the complaint, the Everett Terminal is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change predicted to hit New England in the coming years: sea level rise, increased precipitation, increased magnitude and frequency of storm events, and increased magnitude and frequency of storm surges.
“All of the available modeling shows that… {blah, blah, blah}
[…]
Think Progress


 
If ExxonMobil’s storage and transfer facility is in violation of tht Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the EPA or Massachusetts State regulators might just have noticed it.  If the regulators missed the violations, and this environmental terrorist activist group can make their case in court, ExxonMobil will have to correct the violations and pay for any actual damages.  However, the connection of this to climate change and the moronic #ExxonKnew crackhead conspiracy theory is mindbogglingly stupid.
This bit of total ignorance defies description:

Exxon also built oil rigs in the North Sea to withstand projected climate impacts like sea level rise and rising temperatures.
Yet the company failed to make the same structural improvements to its terminal in Massachusetts, the lawsuit claims…

Now, I am probably going out on a limb to assume that these dimwits actually mean “oil rigs” when they say “oil rigs”… However, ExxonMobil doesn’t build oil rigs.  They contract rigs from companies like Noble Drilling, who paid companies like National Oilwell to build them.  Offshore drilling rigs are designed to survive the weather.
The oil rigs that drilled wells in the North Sea were capable of drilling all over the world.  Half the rigs that were in the Gulf of Mexico 10 years ago have moved overseas, mostly to the Middle East and Africa.  The rigs are capable of working year-round.  Offshore oil rigs don’t notice 0.0035 °C per year of rising temperatures and 3 mm per year of sea level rise.  However, they do notice hurricanes, which occasionally sink them.
Oil rigs are designed to operate in specific water depth ranges.
“Within offshore rigs there are two main categories; jackups and floaters. Jackups do not float, they simply stand on retractable legs (usually three) and hence provide a stable platform from which to drill. The Jackup can of course only work in water depths that are less than the length of its legs, and typically this limits operations to less than 400ft water depth. When moving between drilling locations the hull is usually towed by tugs or carried by a specialist vessel, with the legs sticking high into the air. Once the jackup has arrived at the drilling location, the legs are lowered to the seabed, and then the hull (upon which all the drilling equipment is installed) is jacked up the legs, so raising itself out of the water. Unlike Jackups, floaters are not limited to 400ft water depths as they do not rely on standing on long legs. They are essentially ships with drilling equipment, are usually self propelled and have a marine crew.” http://investmentpedia.net/?page_id=205
 
What happens to an oil rig if sea level rises by 1 foot?
You add 1 foot to the Kelly Bushing (KB).  I’ve been working the Gulf of Mexico since 1988.  To my knowledge, climate change has not forced us to revise the KB’s of any well ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico.
Despite the raging catastrophic rise in sea level since Al Gore invented the Internet and global warming, jackup, semi-submersible and drill ship rigs are still drilling in the same places they were 30 years ago.  Since they are capable of operating in winter, spring, summer and fall, from the North Sea to West Africa to the Middle East to Southeast Asia to the Gulf of Mexico, they did not have to be specially designed to fend off climate change.
The #ExxonKnew Crackhead Conspiracy Theory… ad nauseum
According to the complaint, the Everett Terminal is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change predicted to hit New England in the coming years: sea level rise, increased precipitation, increased magnitude and frequency of storm events, and increased magnitude and frequency of storm surges.
“All of the available modeling shows that… {blah, blah, blah}
ExxonMobil is apparently being sued on the basis of future damages predicted by models which have demonstrated no predictive skill over the past 30 years.  Good luck with that strategy.  Last I checked, legal standing required evidence of actual damages.
Who are the Conservation Law Foundation
Apparently they are a group of attorneys with an affinity for freezing in the dark.


Who is Think Progress?
The short answer is the Hillary Clinton campaign.
The long answer is:
The Center for American Progress (CAP) is a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization. According to CAP, the center is “dedicated to improving the lives of all Americans, through bold, progressive ideas, as well as strong leadership and concerted action.”[2] The Center presents a liberal[3] viewpoint on economic issues. It has its headquarters in Washington, D.C.
The president and chief executive officer of CAP is Neera Tanden, who worked for the Obama and Clinton administrations and for Hillary Clinton’s campaigns.[4] The first president and CEO was John Podesta, who served as chief of staff to then U.S. President Bill Clinton, and is currently serving as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Campaign Director.[5] Podesta remained with the organization as chairman of the board until he joined the Obama White House staff in December 2013. Tom Daschle is the current chairman.[6]
The Center for American Progress runs a campus outreach group, Generation Progress, and a sister advocacy organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Citing Podesta’s influence in the formation of the Obama Administration, a November 2008 article in Time stated that “not since the Heritage Foundation helped guide Ronald Reagan‘s transition in 1981 has a single outside group held so much sway”.[7]

IPCC Intentionally Uses Catastrophic
Non-Science To Incite Policy Action


“The most striking feature of the present reconstruction is the absence of any warming trend in the 20th century”     — Yadav et al., 1997


Bhattacharyya and Chaudhary, 2003

In 2007, IPCC Claimed The Himalayan Region Has Been Warming So Rapidly Its Glaciers Would ‘Disappear’ By 2035

IPCC (2007)
“Glaciers in the Himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world and, if the present rate continues, the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the Earth keeps warming at the current rate. Its total area will likely shrink from the present 500,000 to 100,000 km2 by the year 2035 (WWF, 2005).”


IPCC’s Fake Glacier Melt Claim Came From Activists, Intentionally Put In To Spur Policymakers To Action

David Rose, UK Daily Mail

“The claim that Himalayan glaciers are set to disappear by 2035 rests on two 1999 magazine [phone] interviews with glaciologist Syed Hasnain, which were then recycled without any further investigation in a 2005 report by the environmental [activist] group WWF. It was this report that Dr Lal and his team cited as their source.” 

88% Of Himalayan Glaciers Are Stable Or Advancing — With Overall Negligible Change (0.2%) Since 2000

Bahuguna et al., 2014  (Himalayan Glaciers)
“Two thousand and eighteen glaciers representing climatically diverse terrains in the Himalaya were mapped and monitored [between 2000-2010]. It includes glaciers of Karakoram, Himachal, Zanskar, Uttarakhand, Nepal and Sikkim regions. Among these, 1752 glaciers (86.8%) were observed having stable fronts (no change in the snout position and area of ablation zone), 248 (12.3%) exhibited retreat and 18 (0.9%) of them exhibited advancement of snout. The net loss in 10,250.68 sq. km area of the 2018 glaciers put together was found to be 20.94 sq. km or 0.2%.”

Only 4 Gt Per Year Of ‘High Mountain Asia’ Glacier Loss For 2003-2010

Jacob et al., 2012 (‘High Mountains of Asia’)
“The GIC [global glaciers and ice caps excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets] rate for 2003–2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous mass balance estimate that most closely matches our study period. The high mountains of Asia [Himalayan Region], in particular, show a mass loss of only 4 ± 20 Gt yr−1 for 2003–2010, compared with 47–55 Gt yr−1 in previously published estimates.”
[A 4 Gt mass loss per year is the sea level rise equivalent of 0.01 mm per year, or about one tenth of one centimeter per century.]

Contrary To IPCC Claims, There Has Been No Recent Himalayan Warming

Thapa et al., 2015 (Nepal Himalaya)
“[T]emperature in Central Asia and northern Hemisphere revert back towards cooling trends in the late twentieth century. Thus looking at all the records we observed that our present study is following patterns of temperature variations observed in surrounding regions.”


Krusic et al., 2015  (Himalaya, Bhutan)
“At multidecadal to multicentennial timescales, summer temperatures during much of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries were below the calibration period average, containing deep [cooling] departures that coincide with minima in solar energy output [Usoskin et al., 2002, 2003]. The warmest period occurs within the most recent decade, 2004–2013 C.E.; however, this period is not statistically unprecedented compared with earlier warm periods, e.g., in the 1650s and late fourteenth century.”


Yadav, 2009  (Western Himalaya)
“The decreasing temperature trend in late 20th century is consistent with trends noted in Nepal (Cook et al. 2003), Tibet (Briffa et al. 2001) and Central Asia (Briffa et al. 2001). The cooling trend in late 20th century mean temperature has been found to be due to cooling trend noted in minimum temperature during the second half of the 20th century in semi-arid western Himalaya.”


Zafar et al., 2016 (Pakistan, Karakorum-Himalaya)

Sano et al., 2005  (Nepal)
“March–September temperature was reconstructed for the past 249 years, which shows a warming trend from 1750s until approximately 1790, followed by cooling until 1810, then by a gradual warming trend extending to 1950, and a notable cold period continuing up to the present. No evidence of a consistent warming trend over the last century or two commonly appearing in higher latitudes was found in the present reconstruction”


Li et al., 2011 (Southwest China)


Fan et al, 2009  (Hengduan Mountains, South China)


Yadav and Singh, 2002  (Western Himalaya)
“The 1945–1974 period was the warmest 30-yr mean period of the 20th century. However, this warming, in the context of the past four centuries, appears well within the range of normal limits. The 30-yr mean temperature anomaly for 1662–1691 (0.19°C) exceeds in magnitude (although not significantly, p = 0.23) the 1945–1974 mean (0.05°C).”


Himalayan Region 1-2°C Warmer During Medieval Warm Period

“[T]he Caucasus Mountains are technically considered to be a continuation of the Himalayas”
Solomina et al., 2016 (Caucasus Mountains)
“The climate was warmer and glaciers were likely receding in the beginning of the past millennium CE (the “Arkhyz break in glaciation”). … In this pass, remains of wood radiocarbon dated to 700 ± 80 BP  (1180–1420 CE) were buried in a 1.5-m-thick layer of alluvium (Kaplin et al., 1971; Kotlyakov et al., 1973). Currently, the upper tree limit is located 800–900 m below this elevation. … According to indirect estimates based on pollen analyses, the upper tree limit in the “Arkhyz” period was 200–300 m higher than today (Tushinsky, Turmanina, 1979). The remains of ancient buildings and roads were also found in the Klukhorsky pass at an elevation of 2781 a.s.l. [above sea level] (Tushinsky et al., 1966), and the glacier was still present at this elevation in the mid 20th century. … [I]n Central and East Transcaucasia, there are artificial terraces at elevations where agriculture is not currently possible and that there are remnants of forests in places where forests have not grown since the 16th century CE.”
“Turmanina (1988), based on pollen analysis, suggested that, in the Elbrus area, the climate during the “Arkhyz” time was dryer and warmer than in the late 20th century by 1–2 °C. … Solomina et al. (2014) determined the Medieval warming in the Caucasus to be approximately 1 °C warmer than the mean of the past 4500 years. According to the Karakyol palynological and geochemical reconstructions, the warm period was long and lasted for five centuries. Considering the suggestion of Turmanina (1988) that it was also less humid, the likelihood that many glaciers, especially those located at relatively low elevation, disappeared is very high.  … The maximum glacier extent in the past millennium was reached before 1598 CE.  The advance of the 17th century CE, roughly corresponding to the Maunder Minimum, is recorded at Tsey Glacier. … General glacier retreat started in the late 1840s CE and four to five minor readvances occurred in the 1860s–1880s CE.  In the 20th century CE, the continued retreat was interrupted by small readvances in the 1910s, 1920s and 1970s–1980s.”

"Greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the oceans in regions such as the Baltic by as much as 1.3°C. It is now thought that 90% of the heat added to the climate system by humans has been absorbed in the oceans, a significant amount of which is between depths of 700 to 2000m As a result, marine species are now moving towards the poles, chasing seas of cooler, more comfortable temperatures. This is happening broadly along the predictions provided by models based on species’ preferences and projected ocean temperature change.  Some ecosystems are now under direct threat as a result of such temperature changes, most obviously tropical coral reefs. Here, temperature rise together with natural climatic variation has exceeded coral’s tolerance. This leads to mass coral bleaching, where excessively warm water causes the coral to eject the algae that live symbiotically in its tissues. These algae give coral its bright colours and also feed it energy and nutrients. When they are expelled, coral is left bleached white, and dies. Mass coral bleachings across large areas first occurred in 1979 and there have been dozens since. The very warm El Niño of 1997-98 is estimated to have killed 16% of the world’s coral reefs. The oceans are affected by another phenomenon caused by CO2 emissions, referred to as global warming’s “evil twin”: ocean acidification. The oceans absorb about a third of the CO2 we emit, which is converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) in seawater. This has led to a decrease in 0.1 pH - an increase in acidity - of seawater since the industrial revolution. This may sound a trivial change, but pH is a logarithmic scale, so in fact it represents a 30% increase in acidity. And geologically speaking the time in which this has happened is less than the blink of an eye, a rate of acidification not seen for perhaps 300 million years. Science is playing catch-up trying to understand the implications of acidification for marine life. One of the obvious consequences is that as the ocean becomes more acidic (or more accurately, less alkaline or basic) the concentration of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in seawater reduces. This affects species which secrete shells or skeletons made of aragonite and some forms of calcite, seen by observing the sealife around natural volcanic CO2 vents in the Mediterranean and Papua New Guinea. At vents near Ischia, in the Mediterranean, mussels and limpets and corals show reduced growth of shells and skeletons as acidity rises. These animals disappear from around the vents possibly through competition with algae that do better at higher CO2 concentrations. The combination of warming water and lower pH seems also to further reduce their ability to calcify, and therefore grow. In Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, complex reef-building corals and other important elements of reefs such as calcified coralline algae also disappear from waters influenced by bubbling CO2. This indicates that reef ecosystems may undergo major changes in structure and species diversity as a result of acidification. This, together with mass coral bleaching events, suggests that these coral ecosystems will disappear within a few human generations. But cold, polar waters are also vulnerable to acidification because cold water absorbs more CO2. Projections suggest that areas of the Southern Ocean where calcium carbonate levels are seriously low within 20 years. Already, sea butterflies - small, shelled molluscs that swim in the upper ocean - have been captured in a region of the Southern Ocean with corroded shells. The naturally more acidic seawater here combined with the effects of acidification has already had an impact on species that are important for Antarctic food webs. The larval development of Antarctic krill, the keystone species in Antarctic waters, is severely affected at the high CO2 levels that may occur by the end of the century or beyond. While the Southern Ocean includes some of the most productive waters on Earth and the most spectacular marine predators, the impact of rising temperature and acidity could be extremely severe. Other effects of ocean acidification are less predictable. For example, it alters the chemistry of pollutants, potentially changing their toxicity. It also interferes with the ability of sea creatures to “smell” their environment, affecting the selection of suitable nest sites or predator-prey responses. The ecosystem-level effects of this are as yet unknown. Why does rising ocean warming and acidification matter? For a start, it threatens an important source of food - especially considering that many important fisheries worldwide are already overfished. But more than that, life in the oceans shapes the fundamental processes of the Earth’s major biogeochemical cycles - cycles which, ultimately, maintain the conditions upon which the present-day biota of Earth, including humankind, rely. The likely effects of climate change will be a reduction of species biodiversity, changing ecosystems, possible declines in vital species at the base of food webs and feedbacks that reduce the ocean’s capacity to absorb CO2. Ultimately, it entails unknown but inevitably huge economic and societal consequences for humankind. And, taking a queue from episodes of climate change in the ancient past that triggered wide-scale extinction events, once the CO2 is in the atmosphere and the oceans, returning to previous background levels through natural processes will take in the order of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years."
"As humans, we point all the time. It’s an action we do almost without thinking: even one-year-old infants use pointing and understand what pointing means when an adult does it for them. It’s a really simple, direct way of showing someone else what we want them to see. It lets us say “over there” even without using language. Since it seems to come so naturally to us, it’s been surprising to find that pointing isn’t really used in the rest of the animal kingdom. A simple task has been widely used to test animals’ ability to follow pointing, where a human experimenter hides a piece of food inside one of two identical containers. Then after the experimenter points to where the food is hidden the animal picks one of the containers. Even our closest animal relatives, the great apes, don’t readily follow pointing in this task. They simply don’t seem to understand that when humans point for them, they are trying to communicate with them in a helpful way. The only animals that show much ability at following human pointing are domestic ones, which have had thousands of years to adapt to work with humans, particularly the domestic dog. In a paper published in Current Biology this week, Richard Byrne and I  report the results of an experiment which demonstrates that African elephants spontaneously follow human pointing without having to learn how. This shows a striking similarity between human and elephant cognition. The elephants in the study were 11 captive African elephants in Victoria Falls, where their day job was taking tourists on elephant-back rides. We used the same method as has been used with other animals, but scaled up for elephants: after hiding a piece of fruit in one of two buckets I pointed to where the food was and recorded the first bucket that it put its trunk into. The majority of elephants got it right from the very first trial, and didn’t show signs of learning across the experiment. The elephants in our study were specifically trained to respond to vocal commands only, but not to respond to gestures. The fact that elephants comprehend a very human way of communicating can explain why they have been used by humans so successfully for thousands of years. Elephants have never been domesticated - they are wild animals that for some reason can be trained to work extremely well with humans. This suggests the ancestor of today’s domestic animals may have already had some human-like abilities, in contrast to the theory that domestication is needed to give animals human-like cognitive abilities so that they can work for us. We think elephants understand pointing because it has relevance in elephant behaviour in the wild. Perhaps in time it will be shown that elephants point for each other, possibly with their trunks. Elephants do make very prominent trunk gestures - for example, when one detects the scent of a predator it raises its trunk in an s-shape. In addition to purely enhancing scent detection such a gesture could potentially also function as a point signifying to any other elephants that there is something interesting in the direction of the extended trunk. But we don’t know yet whether this is the case, after all they may be doing nothing more than trying to get a better sniff at what’s around them. Elephants are only very distantly related to us, they form part of an ancient African group of animals including the hyrax and aardvark. They are so unrelated to us that we can assume that elephants’ ability to follow pointing evolved separately from our own, because of similarities in our environments. What elephants have in common with humans is that they live in complex social networks where help and support for others are essential for survival. Field reports abound with descriptions of elephants doing things that look suspiciously like empathy: returning lost calves, helping elephants that have got stuck in mud, and removing embedded spears and veterinary darts. Not to mention that elephants are the only other species known to have more than a passing interest in their dead: they show intense fascination for dead elephants even when there are only bones remaining.   It may be only in such a society that the ability to follow pointing has adaptive value, and this can explain why the great apes don’t follow human pointing readily. Group-living primates constantly compete for food and for mates. In fact they are better at understanding signals in a competitive context than in the context of cooperation, such as pointing to food. Understanding the context of the gesture may be as important as the gesture itself. While this trips up great apes on the pointing task, elephants, used to living cooperatively, instinctively understand."
"For as long as modern humans have been moving around the planet, we’ve been bringing animals, plants and microorganisms with us. But by introducing invasive species to ecosystems in which they did not evolve, we’ve unwittingly created problems that we now spend a great deal of effort and resources trying to rectify.  The North American grey squirrel is one such invasive species that was brought to Britain and Ireland during the 19th and 20th centuries. Since their introduction, grey squirrels have replaced the native red squirrel across much of its former range,  mainly by transmitting squirrel pox to reds, a deadly virus to which greys are immune. Almost all attempts to counter historic blunders with grey squirrels have been met with limited success, but it would seem that nature already has a solution. Until recently, the European pine marten was a little-known member of the weasel family that lives in trees and is restricted within the British Isles to the northern reaches of Scotland and the western coast of Ireland. But in recent years, it has started to reclaim some of its former range. In parts of Ireland and Scotland where this native predator has recovered, there have been subsequent declines in grey squirrel populations, allowing reds to recover.  For conservationists, it almost sounds too good to be true. But why do pine martens seem to benefit native red squirrels at the expense of invasive greys? Researchers sifting through masses of pine marten faeces demonstrated that pine martens eat both squirrel species, but they tend to eat more grey than red squirrels. We know pine martens are opportunistic omnivores, switching food throughout the year and consuming whatever is available. So it’s probably not the preferences of pine martens that lead them to eat more grey squirrels, but the availability of the squirrels themselves.

      Why the pine marten is not every red squirrel's best friend


 One way that prey species avoid predators is with chemical signals. Predators use scent cues to mark territories and communicate with one another, but prey animals have evolved behavioural responses to these scent cues. By eavesdropping on these chemical signals, prey species can alter their behaviour and avoid predators, increasing their chances of survival. Could the grey squirrel, an animal not native to Britain or Ireland, be naive to the risk posed by the pine marten? Armed with camera traps, squirrel feeders and a solution of pine marten poo, we set out to find out if this was the case. We repeated the experiment at 20 different locations across Northern Ireland, amassing more than 8,000 minutes of squirrel footage. The results are published in Royal Society Open Science. Emerging red-eyed from our lab, we realised that red squirrels showed a clear fear response to pine marten scent while greys didn’t. Reds visited feeders less, fed for shorter periods of time and were more vigilant – standing on their hind legs with their head upright and tail twitching from side to side. Meanwhile, the greys continued as if nothing had changed. In some cases, grey squirrel visits to feeding stations actually increased while their vigilance decreased around pine marten scent. Failing to recognise the scent of a predator as a threat leaves the grey squirrels vulnerable. In hindsight though, their behaviour isn’t surprising. Red squirrels and pine martens have shared the same evolutionary landscape for millennia – we would expect them to be aware of each other. But grey squirrels and pine martens have co-existed in the same place for a mere blink of the eye. Although the pine marten predates red and grey squirrels, they have more success in catching greys because they appear oblivious to the threat. Healthy native predator populations have wide ranging benefits to the environment they inhabit. Conservation efforts are helping predators to recover in parts of Europe, ensuring they can restore and regulate ecosystems. If the recovery of a small weasel can have such benefits, there is immense potential for larger predators like lynx and wolves to restore balance to fragmented and degraded ecosystems. Pine martens aren’t a panacea for red squirrels though. Human-led efforts will still be important in red squirrel conservation, especially because prey species can develop responses to new predators in just a few generations. Who knows whether grey squirrels will develop anti-predator behaviours. But if, like the red squirrel, greys learn to recognise and avoid the pine marten, they could one day learn to survive alongside it. Useful though they may be, the pine marten – or any native predator – is more than a solution to a human-made problem. They are an essential and iconic part of the natural world. The conservation and recovery of predators may not always be easy, but in a human-dominated world, we must learn to live alongside what precious biodiversity we have left."

Miscellaneous Notes
At time of posting, all 5 monthly data sets were available through August 2016. The NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data runs 2 days behind real-time. Therefore, real daily data through September 28th is used, and the 29th and 30th are assumed to have the same anomaly as the 28th.
September will be the 14th consecutive month that sets a new record high anomaly for that specific calendar month. I.e. August 2015 was the hottest August in NCEP/NCAR data to that time; September 2015 was the hottest September to that time; October 2015 was the hottest October to that time, etc. NCEP/NCAR data goes back to January 1948.
The GISS and UAH anomaly projections were both more than 0.1 C° off, which I consider a bust. Antarctica was rather warm. I’ll follow it this coming month to see if it affects those 2 data sets more than I project.
The graph immediately below is a plot of recent NCEP/NCAR daily anomalies, versus 1994-2013 base, similar to Nick Stokes’ web page. The second graph is a monthly version, going back to 1997. The trendlines are as follows…

Black – The longest line with a negative slope in the daily graph goes back to late July, 2015, as noted in the graph legend. On the monthly graph, it’s August 2015. This is near the start of the El Nino, and nothing to write home about. Reaching back to 2005 or earlier would be a good start.
Green – This is the trendline from a local minimum in the slope around late 2004, early 2005. To even BEGIN to work on a “pause back to 2005”, the anomaly has to drop below the green line.
Pink – This is the trendline from a local minimum in the slope from mid-2001. Again, the anomaly needs to drop below this line to start working back to a pause to that date.
Red – The trendline back to a local minimum in the slope from late 1997. Again, the anomaly needs to drop below this line to start working back to a pause to that date.

Natural Climate Change continues despite Al Gore and the IPCC. The sun exhibits great variability in the strength of each solar cycle. This variability ranges from extremely quiet “Grand Minima” such as the Maunder Minimum, to very active “Grand Maxima” such as the enhanced activity observed during most of the 20th century.
But the solar Grand Maxima that has persisted during most of the 20th century has come to an abrupt end.
Solar Grand Minima events correspond to periods of dramatic natural global cooling. The Maunder Minimum (about 1645-1715 A.D.) and Spörer Minimum (about 1420-1570 A.D.) are two examples of recent “Grand Minima” events and each period has been referred to as an element of the Little Ice Age.

In a speech today at Georgetown University, President Obama will lay out his sweeping plan to address what he believes is our “moral obligation” to address climate change – apparently oblivious to serious studies questioning the extent and cause of the problem, to the futility of our acting alone as China, India, and others do nothing, and to the far‐​reaching economic effects his plan will have on an economy already struggling with regulatory overkill.   
  
  
And he plans to do all of this not with the concurrence of Congress but in the face of congressional opposition. He will act unilaterally, by executive order. Yet he has that power, thanks to constitutionally dubious congressional delegations and court decisions stretching back over many years. See here for a detailed discussion of how the president came to have such awesome power.

"With the UK opening its doors to three million Hong Kong residents **and China threatening serious retaliation for what it sees as an intrusion into its domestic affairs, the Hong Kong crisis is becoming a real-time test of diplomacy in a pandemic-distracted world.**
So what does this drama tell us about China's emerging place in the new world order? And what light does it throw on the very particular problems posed, post-Brexit, for the British government's efforts to roll out a new and optimistic foreign policy under the banner of ""Global Britain""?
First off, was this crisis inevitable? Things might have been so very different. For well over two decades, most policy-makers in the West hoped that China's rise would unfold in a very specific way.
China, it was said, would become a ""responsible stakeholder"" in the international community. In other words, it would abide by international agreements and norms, because, as part of the system, it benefited from them as much as anyone else.
Maybe in that kind of world, the deal entered into between the British and Chinese governments over Hong Kong's future would have survived.
But things did not turn out like that. China's rise was rapid and single-minded. It became a military superpower, at least in its own region, one that close to home, even the mighty United States would struggle to confront.
But its rise also came about at a time when the West in general and the United States in particular was distracted. There was the war on terrorism and the crisis in Syria. Europe had the distraction of Brexit.
And then there was the Trump administration in the United States which has hardly been consistent on China policy - indeed, it has lacked a strategic sense in foreign policy across the board.
China's rise over the past five years has coincided not just with a relative decline in Washington's standing abroad, but an absolute decline, plunging Washington's alliance systems in Asia, Europe and the Middle East into crisis.
While problems between the West and China grew in number, there was no overall response that saw these as elements - trade tensions, technological rivalries, strategic issues and so on - as part of a bigger ""China problem"" that required a concerted and co-ordinated response.
This was the world on the brink of the Covid-19 crisis; a drama that originated in China and which initially caused some serious problems for Beijing, but one which it was clearly determined to turn to its advantage.
It is no accident then that a more strident nationalist tone in Chinese policy has been the result, ranging from tensions with the US and Australia, Sino-Indian rivalry on their common frontier, and to cap it all, China's decision to overturn the fundamentals of its deal with the UK over Hong Kong.
Indeed the Covid-19 crisis gave Beijing the opportunity to bring the Hong Kong crisis to a head.
However long this pandemic lasts, one consequence is clear - the trajectory of Beijing's more assertive policy is unlikely to change unless real and concerted pressure is brought to bear. And for all the condemnation of China's attitude towards the liberties of the people of Hong Kong, it is hard to see this happening.
This then places the British government in a significant predicament. Mired in mid-pandemic where Prime Minister Boris Johnson government's handling of affairs has been much criticised, this is the first big test of Britain's new bullish and re-branded foreign policy - an approach dubbed ""Global Britain"".
Nobody really knows quite what ""Global Britain"" means.
""Making the best of a bad situation"" is what many opponents of Brexit might cynically note. And to be fair, with the Covid-19 pandemic taking up so much of the government's time, it is simply far too early to make any kind of verdict about ""Global Britain"" on the basis of the Hong Kong experience.
But what this row with China does do is to throw a spotlight on the strengths and weaknesses of the UK's current diplomatic position. It is important to cut through the high-flown rhetoric and look at the stark reality.
Hong Kong is part of China. Britain is the former colonial power which does not cut much ice in Beijing. China is widely held to have broken its agreement, quite apart from pursuing a whole variety of unpleasant internal security policies. But China is something of a superpower and Britain is decidedly not.
So where does this leave Mr Johnson's government? many commentators would say to his credit that he has taken a moral stand in offering sanctuary to some three million people from Hong Kong. This is an extraordinary number and is remarkable from a party whose base is highly sceptical about immigration per se.
The fact that China may not allow many people to leave, or that many will decide to stay, or indeed that many, even if they do leave, will go elsewhere in the world, does not alter the fact that Mr Johnson, when faced with Chinese pressure, has tried to retain the high ground.
But diplomacy is made up of many things. Principled action (many might say there is far too little of that in world affairs) is one thing, but achieving one's foreign policy goals is a team sport. It is about gaining the trust and support of allies, crafting joint positions, and developing joint action.
Here, despite a good deal of rhetorical support for the UK's position on Hong Kong, little has happened beyond words. The Americans are rolling back some of the trading advantages afforded to the territory of Hong Kong, but then, this is an election year and Mr Trump sees getting tough with Beijing as one element of the strategy that he hopes will keep him in the White House.
But ""global Britain"" remains unusually isolated. It is semi-detached from Europe; its tangled negotiations over the future of its relationship with the European Union continue.
And its relationship with the Americans is to say the least complicated. For all the bonhomie between Mr Johnson and Mr Trump, the UK badly needs a trade deal with Washington and is always going to be uncomfortable at the thought of whatever quid pro quo may be required for US support.
Indeed, the pandemic highlights such problems in stark terms. Mr Trump has given us an additional understanding of the meaning of ""America First"" in his decision to buy up the bulk of the supply of the crucial drug remdesivir for treating Covid-19 from its US manufacturer.
The EU is trying to negotiate supplies for its member states. It is not entirely clear where the UK stands in all of this, though press reports quote officials as saying it has secured sufficient supplies for its needs.
This highlights the UK's current position - in but not of Europe, and close but not that close to Washington. It's a powerful reminder too of the increasing weight of the economic and technological in global affairs.
For much of the past century, tanks or nuclear bombs were thought to be the currency of global power. But this was a superficial reading of things, obscuring the fact that, whatever the continuing importance of military hardware, the real reason that the United States dominated in the post-World War Two and Cold War world was its extraordinary economic muscle and research base.
Now China has these attributes too. That is the new world order in which the ship of ""global Britain"" will have to steer.
The UK has many attributes. Relatively, it remains a rich nation. It still retains a seat in the ""directors' box"" of international politics, the UN Security Council. But it is going to have to find a way to re-engage in the post-Covid, post-Brexit world.
Across the globe, there are signs of a growing frustration with Beijing's bullish policies which perhaps really should now be dubbed ""China First"".
The colonial legacy has given the UK a prime role in the unfolding Hong Kong drama. It now needs to play its part in helping to forge a new international consensus on dealing with Beijing: one that at the same time pushes back against Chinese pressure while seeking positively to engage with China's rulers on the big global issues that matter."

Spokesperson  
Fair and Reasonable Campaign



I’m writing to update you on our work over the last ten days, despite the lockdown we’ve not stopped our work. 



**Situation on licences and what it tells us about impending fee hikes**



The Government [has announced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/licenses-wofs-and-regos-extended-under-lockdown) that all driver licences, WoFs, CoFs, and some vehicle certifications, that expired on or after 1 January 2020 will be valid for up to six months from 10 April 2020 – so that drivers aren’t caught out due to the lockdown. [We have publicly called on the Government for the same 6-month amnesty to apply to firearms licences](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO2004/S00091/colfo-urges-minister-to-temporarily-extend-licences.htm), pointing out that our inability to renew licences during the lockdown could see us charged for illegal possession of firearms. **We are worried about being made criminals through no fault of our own.**



This is the latest Police update: 



“Applications from licence holders who licences expired during the Covid19 lockdown period will remain at the price for renewing a current A category licence: $126.50. Applications will be processed as quickly as possible but there will be delays.” 



While this sounds generous, it’s actually quite concerning. You will recall that the Government has always said they were going to change firearm licence fees to pay for their new unnecessary and unfair regime. But the Minister of Police always promised that he would give us an opportunity to comment on the changes. The Police’s statement suggests that they have actually already made the decision to increase fees and that the only thing stopping them from doing so is COVID-19.



Of course, we’ll continue to advocate on your behalf that licenced firearms owners should be involved in a discussion before changes are effected. 



**Legality of the lockdown**



Many people have questioned the legality of the ‘lockdown’ to the extent that it ‘bans’ hunting. Some COLFO constituent member organisations have taken the view that in these times their members should respect the government request. The issue is not really part of the firearms law change problem which is the reason for the Fair and Reasonable campaign, and it would not have been in the minds of people who donated money for the campaign. Nevertheless, we keep a close eye on Police statements about firearms and the legality of using firearms. Therefore we raised our eyebrows (and asked the Police for clarification) when we saw a claim that it was illegal to use a firearm during the lockdown. The second Order of 3 April is pretty clear. It did not prohibit using a firearm on your own property (the one where your residence is located) or as part of operating an essential service (such as on a farm for pest control). It does Order the Police to enforce provisions banning you from leaving your property for the purpose of hunting. 



Police have [revised their website](https://www.police.govt.nz/advice-services/firearms-and-safety/news-and-updates) since our request for clarification. Reference to “firearm use is banned” has been removed and replaced with _“Please stay at home and stay safe. And remember that while you can leave your residence under COVID level 4 for exercise close to home, this excludes hunting.”_



We consider that in the current national climate people should follow the advice of their member organisations, and not challenge the Police on this matter, unless you want to lose a lot of time and possibly your firearms, without public sympathy. However, some who have contacted us might be interested in [this letter sent from our lawyers to the Prime Minister about the legality of the scope of the level 4 bans.](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/fairandreasonable/pages/78/attachments/original/1586387464/Ltr_Lock_down_restrictions_to_Ministers_05_04_2020_FINAL.pdf?1586387464) The letter was sent on behalf a range of our lawyer’s clients affected by the current ‘essential services only’ restrictions (i.e. not just COLFO), but it covers some points applicable to hunters: 



_[…] In our opinion a court considering the reasonableness of the 3 April Order under s 70(10(f) would want to know whether and how the decision-makers assessed the real contagion risks presented by activity outside the residence. For example, how does outdoor solo work where social distancing can be maintained at all times, rate in risk terms against the costs accumulated from banning it. Especially in comparison with other activities that are not being effectively controlled, or are expressly permitted._



 _[…]_ _In the absence of the evidence requested we expect to advise our clients that significant elements of your current regime are probably unlawful. Of course that is a mixed question of fact and law. If there was good evidence that home confinement and cessation of activities deemed non-essential were necessary and efficient requirements (taking account of available alternatives) our current opinion would not be correct. We recognise that there may be practical public messaging or categorisation problems to support some otherwise irrational prohibitions even if most individuals could conduct their specified outdoor activities safely. But on current information it appears that your prohibitions on a lot of “non-essential” activity are outside the law._



 _[…]_ _[…] We think that “essentiality” has come to trump “safety” and cost considerations. It seems to be applied without even getting go the more pertinent question – whether available hygiene and separation methods and behaviours associated with non- essential activity that could similarly limit virus transmission at far less personal and community cost._ _Let us offer an illustrative non-business case. Surfing, many forms of fishing, hunting, mountain biking and running are activities in which the chances of viral transmission are extremely low. The 25 March Health Act Order stated expressly, “Staying 2 metres away from others is an effective measure [to protect you and others from COVID -19]”. We could envisage concern about participants travelling together to venues with people from outside their bubble. Or congregating without observing the disciplines before, during and after the activity. But those risks are readily dealt with under the same enforcement regime as applies to the permitted activities of supermarket and other shopping, and local walking._

**Children’s hospital philanthropist supports COLFO campaign**



Some politicians have promoted a false idea of who and what a firearms owner is, to make it easier for them to demonise ordinary New Zealanders who enjoy firearm-based sports and hobbies. That’s why we’re making a real effort to humanise our campaign and our hobbies. This week we released a video interview with **Mark Dunajtschik.**



Mark Dunajtschik is a philanthropist known for funding the construction of the Wellington Children’s Hospital and has come out in support of our campaign against the Arms Legislation Bill. A keen outdoorsman and hunter his entire life, Mark Dunajtschik sat down with us just before the lockdown to talk about his passion for deerstalking, and reasons why a firearms register will not work. 



The long-time patron of the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association also outlined why the bill being considered by Parliament would impose unnecessary costs upon clubs. Mark Dunajtschik pointed out that the proposed register of firearms will not work because criminals and gangs will refuse to register their firearms. He also discusses the history of one of New Zealand’s most popular firearms, the .303, which was originally a weapon of war before its widespread adoption by Kiwi hunters. 



You will recall the nonsense slogan repeatedly used by the Minister of Police, and taken up by the Prime Minister, talking about the new law being to ban firearms designed to kill people, as if that made it irrelevant to everyone except psychopaths. They set out to vilify most licenced firearms owners.



We applaud Mark Dunajtschik’s courage in speaking up for what is right and hope that others will join him in voicing their concerns over the Arms Legislation Bill. 



**Shane Reti still holding the Government to account**



Finally in this update, we want to give a bouquet to **National Party MP Shane Reti.** Even during lockdown, he is digging deeper into the data breach at the Minister of Culture and Heritage, which the Prime Minister’s office tried to cover up. [He’s been asking Parliamentary written questions of the Prime Minister.](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/order-paper-questions/written-questions/?criteria.Keyword=&criteria.QuestionNumber=&criteria.QuestionYear=&criteria.Subject=Arts+and+Culture&criteria.Timeframe=range&criteria.DateFrom=2020-04-01&criteria.DateTo=2020-04-02&criteria.ParliamentNumber=-1&criteria.Portfolio=) Good to see accountability still being ‘essential’ under lockdown.

Rose Faster Before 1950 Than Since

In recent years it has become increasingly apparent that tide gauge measurements of sea level rise often do not align with climate model expectations.
The models are predicated on the assumption that anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which have risen explosively since about 1950, are the drivers of modern sea level rise.
Evidence from observed sea level trends have not been cooperating with this narrative, however.
Tide gauges indicate there has been a substantial overall reduction in the rate of sea level rise since about 1950 rather than the expected substantial acceleration.
For example, UK oceanographer Simon Holgate reported a 29% deceleration in global sea level rise rates from the first half of the 20th century (1904-1953) to the second half (1954-2003)
Holgate, 2007    “The rate of sea level change was found to be larger in the early part of last century (2.03 ± 0.35 mm/yr 1904–1953), in comparison with the latter part (1.45 ± 0.34 mm/yr 1954–2003).”
A small sampling of regional tide gauge results (SW Pacific, Japan) affirm the deceleration of sea level rise since the mid-20th century, and indicate the highest rates of sea level rise occurred before human CO2 emissions began accelerating rapidly.
Gehrels et al., 2012    “Between 1900 and 1950 relative sea level rose at an average rate of 4.2±0.1 mm/yr. During the latter half of the 20th century the reconstructed rate of relative sea-level rise was 0.7±0.6 mm/yr. Our study is consistent with a similar pattern of relative sea-level change recently reconstructed for southern New Zealand.”

Sasaki et al., 2017    “Sea level variability around Japan from 1906 to 2010 is examined using a regional ocean model, along with observational data and the CMIP5 historical simulations. The regional model reproduces observed interdecadal sea level variability, e.g., high sea level around 1950, low sea level in the 1970s, and sea level rise during the most recent three decades, along the Japanese coast. … That the wind-induced sea level rise along the Japanese coast around 1950 is as large as the recent sea level rise highlights the importance of natural variability in understanding regional sea level change on interdecadal timescales.”

A reconstruction of global-scale rates from tide gauges (Jevrejeva et al., 2008) dating back to 1700 also reveals a deceleration in the rate of sea level increase since 1950.
Jevrejeva et al., 2008


Rates Of Recent Rise For 2,133 Global-Scale Tide Gauges: 1.04 mm/year 

According to a comprehensive analysis (2,133 tide gauges) of Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) data, the current (2014) global mean sea level rise rate is a little more than 1 mm/year.
Parker, 2015   “The nominal satellite altimeter-based determination of the absolute global mean sea level is actually a computational result rather than a direct observation. It is obtained by correcting the satellite altimeter raw signal with algorithms having many features in common with the climate models. Regardless of any modeling problems, Carter et al. (2014) pointed out that estimates of sea-level change from satellite-collected data remain problematic, because of the many uncertainties in data collection and processing. In particular, there is inconsistency between the results derived by different research groups, with all results depending upon the accuracy of complex adjustments, some of which lack in- dependent verification, plus the severe problem that the signal being sought may be less than the noise level of the data being used. Many corrections applied to all satellite altimeter measurements of sea-level since 2003 had the effect of changing a sea-level record that showed no trend or a gentle rise into one that projects high rates of rise.”
“The latest PSMSL Table of Relative Mean Sea Level Secular Trends update 14-Feb-2014 (www.psmsl.org) proposes the relative rates of rise computed for 2133 tide gauges of variable record length (maximum 183 [years], minimum 21 [years], average 56.5 years) with the more recent, shortest readings collected mostly in areas of subsidence and a strongly non uniform geographical coverage. The average relative rate of rise of the 2133 tide gauges is 1.04±0.45 mm/year“

Reconstructed Trends In Total Solar Irradiance 1700-2013

Yndestad and Solheim, 2017
“Deterministic models based on the stationary periods confirm the results through a close relation to known long solar minima since 1000 A.D. and suggest a modern maximum period from 1940 to 2015. The model computes a new Dalton-type sunspot minimum from approximately 2025 to 2050 and a new Dalton-type period TSI minimum from approximately 2040 to 2065. … Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods. Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.”

It has long been established in the peer-reviewed scientific literature that naturally-driven fluctuations in the Earth’s surface temperature preceded the rise and fall of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations for at least the last 800,000 years.
As oceans warm, they release more of their vast stores of CO2; as oceans cool, they retain more CO2.   During cold glacial periods, when ice sheets covered much of the Earth, atmospheric CO2 concentrations only hovered around 200 parts per million (ppm).  After surface temperatures naturally warmed up by multiple degrees C during interglacials, it took at least several hundred years before atmospheric CO2 concentrations began rising in response to the temperature rise.
This lag supports the conclusion that glacial-to-interglacial variations in CO2 concentrations may be driven by temperature changes, as the temperature change occurred well before the CO2 change did.

IPCC AR4 (2007): “Atmospheric CO2 follows temperature changes in Antarctica with a lag of some hundreds of years.”
Caillon et al., 2003     “The sequence of events during Termination III suggests that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 ± 200 years and preceded the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation.”
Fischer et al., 1999    “High-resolution records from Antarctic ice cores show that carbon dioxide concentrations increased by 80 to 100 parts per million by volume 600 ± 400 years after the warming of the last three deglaciations.”
Monnin et al., 2001     “The start of the CO2 increase thus lagged the start of the [temperature] increase by 800 ± 600 years.”
 Kawamura et al., 2007    “Our chronology also indirectly gives the timing of the CO2 rise at [glacial] terminations, which occurs within 1 kyr of the increase in Antarctic temperature.”
Indermuhle  et al., 2000    “The [CO2] lag was calculated for which the correlation coefficient of the CO2 record and the corresponding temperatures values reached a maximum. The simulation yields a [CO2] lag of (1200 ± 700) yr.
Landais et al., 2013     “[F]rom 130.5 to 129,000 years ago, the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations lagged that of Antarctic temperature unequivocally….At mid-slope, there is an unequivocal lead of δ15N [temperature] over CO2 of 900 ± 325 yr”.
Schneider et al., 2013    “Furthermore, a  5,000 yr lag  in the CO2 decline relative to EDC [East Antarctica] temperatures is confirmed during the glacial inception at the end of MIS5.5 (120,000 yrs before present).”
Stott et al., 2007     “Deep-sea temperatures warmed by ∼2°C between 19 and 17 thousand years before the present (ky B.P.), leading the rise in atmospheric CO2 and tropical–surface-ocean warming by ∼1000 years.”
The occurrence of temperature change leading the CO2 concentration growth rate change may also occur in the modern era.
Flohn, 1982    “Comparative investigations (Keeling and Bacastow 1977, Newll et al. 1978, Angell 1981) found a positive correlation between the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 and the fluctuations of sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific, which are caused by rather abrupt changes between upwelling cool water and downwelling warm water (“El Niño“) in the eastern equatorial Pacific. … A crude estimate of these differences is demonstrated by the fact that during the period 1958-1974, the average CO2-increase within five selective years with prevailing cool water only 0.57 ppm/a [per year], while during five years with prevailing warm water it was 1.11 ppm/a.  Thus in a a warm water year, more than one Gt (1015 g) carbon is additionally injected into the atmosphere, in comparison to a cold water year.”
Jones and Cox, 2005    “There is clear similarity between Figures 1b and 1c, with the positive CO2 growth rate anomalies corresponding to El Niño [warming] events, and the negative growth rate anomalies corresponding to La Niña [cooling] events. … It is unlikely that these anomalies can be explained by an abrupt increase in anthropogenic emissions, as the anomalies are much larger than annual increases in fossil fuel emissions.  Most interannual variability in the CO2 growth rate is attributable to variations in land-atmosphere CO2 exchange with climate (e.g., associated with ENSO or volcanic perturbations)”

Geothermal Heat Flux Leads Temperature, CO2 Rise By 1000s Of Years

It has recently been suggested that there is a “detection of Milankovitch [millennial-scale climate changes linked to the Earth’s orbit] frequencies in global volcanic activity” (Kutterolf et al., 2012), or that variations in geothermal or volcanic activity are not random, but function within short- and long-term cycles and periodicities that could be linked to the Sun-Earth connection itself.
Tolstoy, 2015   “Pulsing of seafloor volcanic activity may feed back into climate cycles, possibly contributing to glacial/interglacial cycles, the abrupt end of ice ages, and dominance of the 100 kyr cycle.”
With this in mind, it should not be particularly surprising that Russian geophysicists Demezhko and Gomostaeva (2015) recently found the geothermal heat flux from below the Earth’s surface may have risen 2 to 3 thousand years before the surface temperatures and CO2 concentrations began rising.
Demezhko and Gornostaeva, 2015    “Despite the substantial dispersion of CO2 estimations, a character and a chronology of CO2 concentration changes are much closer to temperature changes rather than to heat flux variations. It may mean no significant contribution of CO2 forcing to climatically caused heat flux and thus to the temperature increase during Pleistocene–Holocene warming.”
“[T]he increase of carbon dioxide may be a consequence of temperature increasing. Comparing the chronology of surface flux, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration changes, we can draw some conclusions about the causes of climate change. … The increase of carbon dioxide concentrations occurred 2–3 thousands of years later than the heat flux increase and synchronously with temperature response.”
Therefore, the order for net heat energy changes in the Earth system may be this: First, there is (a) a change (increase) in the heat flux from beneath the Earth’s surface (with an ostensible connection to solar-orbital changes), (b) the Earth’s surface temperature rises, and (c) CO2 concentrations rise.

A new paper from Demezhko, Gornostaeva, and two other colleagues again provides further evidence that heat flux leads surface temperature change by about 1000 to 2000 years, and that this sequencing therefore “does not depend on climate change”.
Temperature and heat flux changes at the base of 
Laurentide ice sheet inferred from geothermal data
Demezhko et al., 2017
“Recently, geothermal data have been used to estimate transient climatically caused surface heat flux (SHF) changes (Beltrami et  al. 2000, 2002; Beltrami 2001; Demezhko et  al. 2013; Volobuev 2013; Demezhko and Gornostaeva 2015). This heat flux has been introduced as a useful new paleoclimate characteristic. It should be distinguished from the steady-state background heat flow. The latter is attributed to the Earth’s internal heat sources and does not depend on climate change. Both these fluxes are independent components of the ground surface heat balance. … GST [ground surface temperature] and SHF [surface heat flux] histories differ substantially in shape and chronology.  [Subsurface] Heat flux changes ahead of temperature changes by 500–1000 years.”
“Geothermal reconstructions spanning tens of thousands of years are of special importance for understanding the climate history of the Earth. During this period (15–10-ka BP) the last glacial period of pleistocene (Wisconsinan in central North America, Weichselian or Vistulian in Northern Europe, Valdai in Eastern Europe, Zyryanka and Sartan in Siberia) ended and the current Holocene interglacial began.”
“More recently, Demezhko et  al. (2013) and Demezhko and Gornostaeva (2015) reconstructed long-term surface heat flux histories near Lake Onega in Karelia and in the Middle Urals, respectively. It was noted that the long-term heat flux changes differ considerably from the temperature changes. The temperature curve reveals a sharp rise in the early Holocene (12−10-ka BP) and a relatively stable warm climate of interglacial, while the heat flux began to increase about 2 ka [2000 years] earlier [13000 years ago vs. 11000 years ago for surface temperature], reached a maximum at the beginning of the Holocene, and then decreased.”
Figure 4d from the paper shows the trajectory of the reconstructed temperature changes from the site (Alberta, Canada) as determined by geothermal data.  Notice that modern temperatures are ~8°C cooler than they were about 4,500 years ago.
“These results (Fig.  4d) indicate an abrupt increase of summer (from May to August) temperatures between 12 and 10 ka BP, relative stabilization 10–7 ka BP, another increase after 7 ka BP, and rapid decline to modern values after 3  ka BP.”


Greenland Warms, Melts Significantly Due To Heat Flux From Below

Considering the magnitude of heat energy required to melt polar ice sheets from below, and that central Antarctica’s air temperatures average about -55°C year-round, it should not be surprising that a significant portion of the meltwater flow from both polar ice sheets (Greenland and Antarctica) is derived from “heat flow from the deep Earth”.
Rogozhina et al., 2016    “Ice-penetrating radar and ice core drilling have shown that large parts of the north-central Greenland ice sheet are melting from below. It has been argued that basal ice melt is due to the anomalously high geothermal flux that has also influenced the development of the longest ice stream in Greenland. Here we estimate the geothermal flux beneath the Greenland ice sheet and identify a 1,200-km-long and 400-km-wide geothermal anomaly beneath the thick ice cover. We suggest that this anomaly explains the observed melting of the ice sheet’s base, which drives the vigorous subglacial hydrology and controls the position of the head of the enigmatic 750-km-long northeastern Greenland ice stream.”
Petrunin et al., 2013    “Here we use a coupled ice–lithosphere model driven by climate and show that the oldest and thickest part of the Greenland Ice Sheet is strongly influenced by heat flow from the deep Earth. … Complex interactions between geothermal heat flow and glaciation-induced thermal perturbations in the upper crust over glacial cycles lead to strong regional variations in basal ice conditions, with areas of rapid basal melting adjoining areas of extremely cold basal ice.”
Fahnestock et al., 2001    High Geothermal Heat Flow, Basal Melt, and the Origin of Rapid Ice Flow in Central Greenland … “Age-depth relations from internal layering reveal a large region of rapid basal melting in Greenland. Melt is localized at the onset of rapid ice flow in the large ice stream that drains north off the summit dome and other areas in the northeast quadrant of the ice sheet. Locally, high melt rates indicate geothermal fluxes 15 to 30 times continental background. The southern limit of melt coincides with magnetic anomalies and topography that suggest a volcanic origin.”
van der Veen et al., 2007     “[T]here is a growing body of evidence suggesting more extensive basal melting in the central region of northern Greenland. … The basal melt rate at NGRIP reaches 7.5 mm ice per year, and the modeled geothermal heat flux is between 90 and 160 mW/m2 along the flow line originating 50 km upstream of the drill site (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003).  Again, the origin of the large geothermal heat flux remains unidentified. Ice-penetrating radar profiles show bright bed reflections in many locations in northern Greenland, indicating the presence of lubricating meltwater at the glacier base.”
Lilja Buchardt and Dahl-Jensen, 2007     “From radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys and ice core data it can be seen that the ice sheet is melting at the base in a large area in Northern Greenland. The RES images reveal internal layers in the ice. The layers are former deposition surfaces and are thus isochrones. Undulations of the isochrones in regions where the base is smooth suggest that the basal melt rate changes over short distances. This indicates that the geothermal heat flux is very high and has large spatial variability in Northern Greenland. Combining the estimated basal melt rates with the observed borehole temperatures allows us to convert the basal melt rates to geothermal heat flow values. From the two-dimensional model we find the basal melt rate and geothermal heat flux at NorthGRIP to be 6.1 mm a−1 and 129 mW m−2, respectively.”
Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003    “From temperature measurements down through the 3001 m deep borehole at the North Greenland Icecore Project (NorthGRIP) drill site, it is now clear that the ice at the base, 3080 m below the surface, is at the pressure-melting point. This is supported by the measurements on the ice core where the annual-layer thicknesses show there is bottom melting at the site and upstream from the borehole. … The results show the geothermal heat flow varies from 50 to 200 mW m-2 along the 100 km section of the modeled flowline. The melt rate at the NorthGRIP site is 0.75 cm a-1, but the deep ice in the NorthGRIP core originated 50 km upstream and has experienced melt rates as high as 1.1 cm a-1.”

Antarctic Warms, Melts Significantly Due To Heat Flux From Below

Fisher et al., 2015    “We report the first direct measurement of geothermal heat flux into the base of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), below Subglacial Lake Whillans, determined from the thermal gradient and the thermal conductivity of sediment under the lake. The heat flux at this site is 285 ± 80 mW/m2, significantly higher than the continental and regional averages estimated for this site using regional geophysical and glaciological models. Independent temperature measurements in the ice indicate an upward heat flux through the WAIS of 105 ± 13 mW/m2. The difference between these heat flux values could contribute to basal melting and/or be advected from Subglacial Lake Whillans by flowing water. The high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region.“
Maule et al., 2005    “The geothermal heat flux is an important factor in the dynamics of ice sheets; it affects the occurrence of subglacial lakes, the onset of ice streams, and mass losses from the ice sheet base. Because direct heat flux measurements in ice-covered regions are difficult to obtain, we developed a method that uses satellite magnetic data to estimate the heat flux underneath the Antarctic ice sheet. We found that the heat flux underneath the [Antarctic] ice sheet varies from 40 to 185 megawatts per square meter and that areas of high heat flux coincide with known current volcanism and some areas known to have ice streams.”
Schroeder et al., 2014    “Heterogeneous geothermal flux and subglacial volcanism have the potential to modulate ice sheet behavior and stability by providing a large, variable supply of meltwater to the subglacial water system, lubricating and accelerating the overlying ice.  …  Thwaites Glacier is one of the largest, most rapidly changing glaciers on Earth, and its landward sloping bed reaches into the deep interior of the WAIS [West Antarctic Ice Sheet], making it a leading component in scenarios for rapid deglaciation. … [H]eterogeneous geothermal flux beneath Thwaites Glacier is likely a significant factor in local, regional, and continental-scale ice sheet stability.”
Corr and Vaughan, 2008    A recent volcanic eruption beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet … “Indirect evidence suggests that volcanic activity occurring beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet influences ice flow and sheet stability. …  Ongoing volcanic heat production may have implications for contemporary ice dynamics in this glacial system.”
Vogel and Tulaczyk, 2006    “Subglacial volcanism in West Antarctica may play a crucial role in the dynamics and stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Evidence supporting the existence of an individual subglacial volcanic center (Mt. Casertz) in the upper catchments of Whillans and Kamb Ice Stream (WIS and KIS), comes from a comparison of ice sheet modeling results with measured ice velocities. Lubrication [melting ice] of an area, which otherwise should be frozen to its bed, is best explained by basal melt water generated in the vicinity of Mt. Casertz.”
Blankenship et al., 1993    “Here we present aerogeophysical evidence for active volcanism and associated elevated heat flow beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet near the critical region where ice streaming begins. If this heat flow is indeed controlling ice-stream formation, then penetration of ocean waters inland of the thin hot crust of the active portion of the West Antarctic rift system could lead to the disappearance of ice streams, and possibly trigger a collapse of the inland ice reservoir.”
Damiani et al., 2014    “One major contributor to fast glacial flow is the presence of subglacial water, the production of which is a result of both glaciological shear heating and geothermal heat flux. A zone of thinner crust is also identified near the area’s subaerial volcanoes lending support to a recent interpretation predicting that this part of Marie Byrd Land is a major volcanic dome, likely within the West Antarctic Rift System itself.  [W]e prefer the hypothesis that Marie Byrd Land volcanoes are thermally-supported by warmer upper mantle. The presence of such inferred warm upper mantle also suggests regionally elevated geothermal heat flux in this sector of the West Antarctic Rift System and consequently the potential for enhanced meltwater production beneath parts of Thwaites Glacier itself.”

Significance Of Geothermal Influence On Climate System ‘Unknown’

There is still much to learn about geothermal factors and their relation to the Earth’s climate system.  More than 70% the Earth’s volcanism occurs under the sea floor, unobserved, and there are more than 100,000 extinct and active locations beneath the ocean depths.
Considering how influential fluctuations heat flow from beneath the Earth may be in leading/determining surface temperatures, subglacial volcanism and ice sheet melt, carbon cycling, and climate change in general, it would probably be wise to continuing studying geothermal heat flux effects on the Earth system rather than declaring climate science already “settled“.
Kelley, 2017     Volcanology: Vulcan rule beneath the sea … “Over 70% of the volcanism on Earth occurs beneath an ocean veil. … Satellite data reveal more than 100,000 extinct and active seamounts that mark sites of past and present volcanic activity.  [O]bservations imply that submarine volcanoes may play an important role in cycling carbon and sulfur through the Earth, oceans and atmosphere.”
“[T]he flux of volatiles from these systems remains poorly quantified and the significance of these volcanoes as part of the deep carbon and sulfur cycles on a global scale is unknown.”
On the other hand, it’s been recently discovered that seismic activity has been highly correlated (~0.80) with global temperatures in recent decades.
Viterito, 2017      “The Correlation of Seismic Activity and Recent Global Warming (CSARGW) demonstrated that increasing seismic activity in the globe’s high geothermal flux areas (HGFA) is strongly correlated with global temperatures (r=0.785) from 1979-2015. The mechanism driving this correlation is amply documented and well understood by oceanographers and seismologists. Namely, increased seismic activity in the HGFA (i.e., the mid-ocean’s spreading zones) serves as a proxy indicator of higher geothermal flux in these regions. The HGFA include the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the East Pacific Rise, the West Chile Rise, the Ridges of the Indian Ocean, and the Ridges of the Antarctic/Southern Ocean. This additional mid-ocean heating causes an acceleration of oceanic overturning and thermobaric convection, resulting in higher ocean temperatures and greater heat transport into the Arctic. This manifests itself as an anomaly known as the “Arctic Amplification,” where the Arctic warms to a much greater degree than the rest of the globe. Applying the same methodology employed in CSARGW, an updated analysis through 2016 adds new knowledge of this important relationship while strengthening support for that study’s conclusions. The correlation between HGFA seismic frequency and global temperatures moved higher with the addition of the 2016 data: the revised correlation now reads 0.814, up from 0.785 for the analysis through 2015. This yields a coefficient of determination of .662, indicating that HGFA [high geothermal flux area] seismicity accounts for roughly two-thirds of the variation in global temperatures since 1979.”

If long time and highly respected **CNN** journalist **Christiane Amanpour** can make the comment that one of the positive outcomes of Covid-19 is the serious reduction in pollution of the skies over China, perhaps I can take a moment to add a few more.



Before I do, let me just put on record that I think it’s a pathetically puerile thing for any journalist to say. It’s the kind of comment one might almost write off had it been made by one of the journalism school half-trained half-wits that seem to be running most of the world’s newsrooms today but coming from a seasoned and experienced, mature journalist, with a huge worldwide reputation, I can but marvel in despair. **Over 3,000 deaths from the virus** : Seems a fair price to pay for a bit of blue sky over Beijing don’t you think?



We all need a bit of “posidividdy” in our lives, so if this is to be the standard we are to use as a measure, maybe I can dive down through the scum and scrape the bottom of the barrel for some “posidives” of my own. 



The MSM has been full of Coronavirus for days on end to the complete exclusion of pretty much anything else that is happening on the planet. That in itself has to be a plus even though the coverage has often bordered on sensationalism and they still managed to find ways of blaming Donald Trump for it.



To be fair, Coronavirus is the main story of the day and everything else has been relegated to subheadings. It’s been a full two weeks since there’s been any mention (that I’ve seen or heard) of Greta Thunberg, climate strikes or climate change. That makes the smog over China pale into insignificance in my view. Could it be said that killing off some old folks in exchange for not having “How dare you” Greta all over the media, would have to rate as a fair price to pay: Amanpour has made it so.



Shall I go on? Maybe not. It started as a bright idea but actually, I’m getting depressed writing this and remembering how much pathetic stuff passes for international news these days.



It would be remiss of the MSM not to treat the biggest story in the world as the biggest story in the world so I won’t go on about it, but I do think Ms Amanpour’s comment rates as one of the journalistic [stuff-ups](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/the-bfd-stuff-up-of-the-week/) of the year, though if you take it away from the misery of this cursed virus, it does point to just how awful the air over Beijing really is.

A basic contention of developing countries (DCs) and various UN bureaucracies and multilateral groups during the course of International negotiations on climate change is that industrialized countries (ICs) have a historical responsibility for global warming. This contention underlies much of the justification for insisting not only that industrialized countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions even as developing countries are given a bye on emission reductions, but that they also subsidize clean energy development and adaptation in developing countries. [It is also part of the rationale that industrialized countries should pay reparations for presumed damages from climate change.]   
  
  
Based on the above contention, the Kyoto Protocol imposes no direct costs on developing countries and holds out the prospect of large amounts of transfer payments from industrialized to developing countries via the Clean Development Mechanism or an Adaptation Fund. Not surprisingly, virtually every developing country has ratified the Protocol and is adamant that these features be retained in any son‐​of‐​Kyoto.   
  
  
For their part, UN and other multilateral agencies favor this approach because lacking any taxing authority or other ready mechanism for raising revenues, they see revenues in helping manage, facilitate or distribute the enormous amounts of money that, in theory, should be available from ICs to fund mitigation and adaptation in the DCs.

"**The UK has said it is considering more rights for holders of a special passport issued to some people in Hong Kong.**
The territory, which used to be a British colony, was handed back to China in 1997. Anyone born before then is eligible to apply for a British National (Overseas) passport, known as a BNO.
If China implements a controversial proposed security law, people holding the BNO, could get a ""path to citizenship"", the UK said.
The BNO passport is essentially a travel document that does not carry citizenship rights with it - although you are entitled to some consular assistance outside of Hong Kong and China with it.
It was issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before Hong Kong was handed over to China.
Around 300,000 people currently hold a BNO passport, allowing them to visit the UK visa-free for six months. An estimated 2.9 million people are eligible for a BNO passport, said the British Consulate General in Hong Kong.
Though it gives the passport holder the right to remain in the UK for up to six months, it doesn't automatically allow them to reside or work there. They also aren't allowed to access public funds, including things like government benefits.
BNO holders cannot pass this status on to their children.
China on Thursday formally approved a plan to impose controversial national security legislation in Hong Kong. It could go into effect as early as the end of June.
Hong Kong was handed back to China, on a number of conditions. These include the region's high level of autonomy and maintaining certain rights like freedom of speech that do not exist in mainland China.
But this new plan, if put into law, would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and many are concerned it could end Hong Kong's unique status.
The move triggered a wave of criticism around the world, with many - including Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong - urging the UK to stand up for the territory.
Later on Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the country would move to scrap the six-month stay limit for BNO holders if China goes on to officially implement the law.
Mr Raab said that BNO passport holders would be allowed to ""apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship"".
As a way to help people in Hong Kong who would rather not stay there if the new security laws are implemented, it might prove more symbolic.
For starters only a small percentage of people in Hong Kong currently have a BNO.
But also, the people who the security laws are aimed at - the young anti-mainland protesters who have been getting into violent confrontations with police for months - are not likely to be eligible for the BNO because of their age.
Additionally, though the BNO gives the passport holder the right to visit the UK for up to a year potentially, it's not clear what other benefits the extension might bring, or if the UK would make it any easier administratively for those already in the country to apply for work or study.
On social media, some Hong Kongers dismissed it as a gesture that amounted to little more than a 12-month tourist visa.
Effectively, it means that those who come to stay in the UK for a year, and who have the funds to be able to extend this enough, could eventually be eligible to apply for citizenship.
It cuts out some of the administrative hoops BNO holders would have had to jump through before this move if they wanted this path.
China has firmly opposed the move by the UK, saying it is a violation of the handover agreement that stipulates BNO passport holders do not enjoy UK residency.
China has repeatedly warned Britain to stay out of its affairs in Hong Kong.
The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming had previously accused some British politicians of viewing Hong Kong ""as part of the British empire""."
"This was taken in Senegal near the end of 2018. I was gearing up for a project in neighbouring Mauritania for Reuters, but I wanted to understand the region better before I dived in. I had spent a few years based in west Africa. Where Mauritania can be quite closed off to outsiders and suspicious of photographers, Senegal is much more open. I’d met a lot of people in the Senegalese diaspora in the US, where I grew up, and I’d heard a lot about Saint Louis in the north. It was the capital before Dakar took on that role, and it’s a fascinating testament to the country’s colonial past. Unlike many colonial projects elsewhere on the continent, the French didn’t attempt to completely repress who the Senegalese were as a people, and the city bears the marks of its complicated history. Much of the old town’s architecture is very French. Lots of mixed race people born of relationships between local women and French soldiers also live in Saint Louis. I was captivated by its history and its present.  Today, though, Saint Louis is under threat. It’s one of the many frontlines in the climate catastrophe. Houses on the beachfront have been devastated by rising sea levels. When the ocean surges, the water rips out the sand underneath the foundations of people’s homes. Roofs are missing, whole rooms are now underwater, some people only have one wall standing in the house they lived in their whole lives. Many people are already being displaced. Some from Saint Louis have been forced to move into tented cities because of the destruction of their homes. I learned of one village from which around 80,000 people have been forced to move inland to avoid the rising water. This little boy is playing on a retaining wall erected to defend homes from the sea. Something struck me about him: his imagination turned this structure defending his home into a playground. He’s striding above it like a king with his little stick. It captured, for me, the incredible resilience of children and the imagination of childhood. It’s an image of strength. But it’s also tragic. In a few years, he will be forced to understand the role of that retaining wall, and he will likely have to join the thousands forced to live in makeshift homes. The ocean sustains the fishing communities, and offers a space for its children to play, but it’s now threatening to engulf the city. Obviously this isn’t Senegal’s problem alone. I have a place in New York City and a few years ago the neighbourhood was ruined by flooding. Today, I live in Jakarta. The whole city is quite literally sinking. But adversity can also provoke incredible responses. My work has always been interested as much in resilience and responses to trauma as it has in trauma itself. I’m fascinated by how people adapt, and by their boundless ability to survive. The community in Saint Louis is so tight knit, partly because of its history and the threats it faces today. I met a woman whose home was destroyed and she now lives with her five children in a side room of her neighbour’s house. People can perform extraordinary acts of care for one another, so long as the community pulls together. Born: US. Trained: Parsons School of Design, New York.

"As Conservatives head to Manchester for their annual party conference this weekend, it seems a very long time since David Cameron, then newly-elected party leader, urged the electorate to “Vote Blue, Go Green”, and made a high-profile visit to the Norwegian Arctic to inspect the effects of climate change for himself. Despite his insistence that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition should aim to be the “greenest government ever”, it seems that the experience of high office has transformed Cameron from a husky hugger to a fracking fanatic, giving greens of all political persuasions a bad case of the blues. Back in 2006, an environmentally-friendly image had various uses for Cameron. 
It offered him an issue with which to detoxify the Conservative brand with a new, more caring Conservative image. Among the various modernising messages he could have chosen, it was least likely to upset his opponents since even Margaret Thatcher had evinced concern about the environment on occasion. He could also call Edmund Burke, the 18th century founder of modern conservatism, as a supportive witness, since Burke had written of the duty owed by the living to future generations - a fine ideological directive for a environmental stance. To the cynics, Cameron’s “green phase” was never anything more than relatively costless political posturing. After all, the environment was of low importance to voters generally, let alone Conservative supporters, when Cameron became leader. Once Cameron had milked it of its photo-opportunity potential – and encountered embarrassing publicity when he was shown cycling to work with a gas-guzzling car following close behind him – he was only too ready to relegate the environment from his ‘to do’ list to his pending tray. There is another explanation for Cameron’s approach to the environment, which might be kinder to the Prime Minister but is no less depressing for environmentalists. When Cameron associated himself with green politics, the economy seemed sound. As the banking crisis unfolded from 2007, even a genuine believer could only expect that most voters would start to see environmental protection as a luxury which the country could barely afford. This consideration seems to have weighed particularly heavily with Cameron’s friend and adviser, George Osborne. Osborne may or may not be a climate-change denier (like his Tory predecessor as Chancellor, Nigel Lawson). But, anxious to generate economic growth before the next election regardless of long term cost, Osborne is well aware that true blue Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph-reading Conservative supporters tend to think that climate change is nothing to worry about.  Against this background, it’s reasonable to assume the prime minister’s concern about the environment was always sincere, but has been put in the shade since 2006 by electoral calculations. At the next election, the state of the economy will be the most influential factor. Prioritising environmental protection over economic growth in the short term – by increasing petrol taxes, or instigating a massive wind farm building programme in Tory heartlands – would alienate core Conservative supporters who have many other reasons to feel fed up. So it is not likely to happen. Despite Burke’s eloquence on the subject, Cameron’s insistence that conservatives are natural custodians of the environment has never cut much ice among Conservative Party activists. But in the context of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Conservative MPs with green leanings might have expected to be able to exercise some leverage. In June, former Cabinet minister Tim Yeo faced off against the government with an amendment that would have written a drastic reduction of carbon-generated power by 2030 into the Energy Bill. Only eight Conservative MPs, including long-standing environmental activist Zac Goldsmith, and 16 Lib Dem MPs voted for the amendment, which was defeated quite comfortably despite this rebellion. The vote was a clear indication that the most committed green Tory MPs were losing patience with the government, and were preparing to flex their muscles. Unfortunately for them, the scale of the rebellion suggested that they were not particularly muscular. However, green Conservatives do at least enjoy a prominent parliamentary platform. Several of the rebels (including Goldsmith) are members of the Commons’ Environmental Audit Committee. In the past this has been prepared to issue critical reports, and more can be expected from the same quarter. Nevertheless, experience shows that critical committee reports only force governments to take action when they attract sympathetic media coverage. The ingrained hostility of Conservative-supporting newspapers to the green case thus closes down this potential route to influence. For environmentalists, the coalition’s record has been one of small steps in the right direction (like the establishment of the Green Bank), combined with prodigious backward strides of which fracking is only the latest example. Meanwhile Lib Dem ministers, including the increasingly-restive Ed Davey, have remained in office despite evidence that their concerns are being outweighed by short-term considerations.  For both coalition partners - and indeed for Labour, whose approach to the subject seems broadly similar - the environmental is likely to be an issue best avoided at the next election. The more it is mentioned, the more likely it is that those who take the plight of the environment seriously will decide that the only way to “Go Green” is to “Vote Green”. "
"**UK-based bank Standard Chartered has restated its commitment to Hong Kong despite criticism over its stance.**
The comments came as the bank said its first half profits had slumped due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It also said the outlook was clouded by political unrest in Hong Kong, which is its largest market.
In recent weeks both Standard Chartered and HSBC have come under fire over their positions on China's actions in the city.
In a statement, Standard Chartered's group chairman JosÃ© ViÃ±als addressed the international tensions over China's policies in Hong Kong:
""We are convinced that more collaboration - not less - is the best way to find a sustainable equilibrium in these complex situations, but we do not expect an easy or quick resolution.
""We do believe, however, that Hong Kong will continue to play a key role as an international financial hub and we are fully committed to contributing to its continued success,"" he added.
The comments from Standard Chartered come days before rival lender HSBC is due to publish its own half-year earnings.
Last month, both banks gave their backing to China's new security laws for Hong Kong.
Standard Chartered and HSBC issued statements that said the legislation can help maintain long-term stability in the city.
However, that stance was criticised at the time by a leading investor in the two banks.
David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities at UK insurer Aviva, which holds around $1bn (Â£770m) in shares of Standard Chartered and HSBC said: ""If companies make political statements, they must accept the corporate social responsibilities that follow.
""Consequently, we expect both companies to confirm that they will also speak out publicly if there are any future abuses of democratic freedoms connected to the law,"" he added.
Standard Chartered's comments on Hong Kong came alongside its earnings for the first half of the year.
Underlying pre-tax profit fell 25% to $1.95bn (Â£1.5bn) as economic weakness drove up the number of bad loans on its books.
The bank said it had increased the amount of money set aside to cover potential bad loans in the first six months to $1.57bn.
""Low interest rates and depressed oil prices continue to be headwinds and we expect new waves of Covid-19 related challenge in the coming quarters but I am confident that our resilience and client franchise will see us through,"" said group chief executive Bill Winters.
The Covid-19 pandemic is hitting businesses globally as governments around the world shut down their economies to try to slow the spread of the virus."
"There has long been talk of the need for a “nuclear renaissance”, and now it seems underway. The deal has been struck that would see the first new British nuclear power station in a generation. But is this the first of a whole fleet of new nuclear power plants, or just a one-off project? The latter has happened before – at Sizewell B in Suffolk, the single reactor built in 1995 was to have been the first of a new generation of planned plants. Today’s news is that a two reactor power station is to be built at Hinkley Point near Bristol capable of supplying 3,340MW, or roughly 7% of British electricity in the 2020s. This has come at a price, called the “strike price”. French company EDF Energy, the lead firm of the construction consortium, has secured a long-term commitment from the government that the nuclear-powered electricity it generates will be bought at the hefty price of £92.50 per megawatt hour. That wholesale price is almost double today’s market price, and isn’t far off what the end consumer is paying today to keep their lights on. When wholesale prices meet retail prices things are unsustainable. Don’t forget that between power generation and use there are businesses that deal with transmission, distribution and supply, and they all need their cut. New nuclear power stations will help us with our ambition to decarbonise the power sector and will do much to improve energy security. But nuclear power stations are not cheap, especially the French European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) chosen for Hinkley Point C. The high upfront costs of nuclear power today run into a political reality that for consumers, and hence voters, the dominant consideration in electricity is the bill and most especially the policy component of that bill. EDF Energy has done well to win a high strike price for the new reactor at Hinkley Point. Prime Minister David Cameron has explained to the nation why it is a price that should be paid. The government believes in this step towards a renaissance of nuclear power in Britain, and he is willing to absorb the political heat even on the day that another of the big six power firms, NPower, hiked its electricity price by 9.3% and gas price by a whopping 11.1%. While the UK can probably afford to build Hinkley C, it would struggle to afford a fleet of such low carbon nuclear power stations at such prices - consumers are just too tightly squeezed. If the UK’s low carbon targets are to be achieved, then the costs of low carbon electricity options including nuclear and renewables must fall if we are to succeed in replacing our polluting coal and gas power stations. The two reactors to be built at Hinkley will be the third and fourth of a kind in Europe. Experience with the first two in Finland and France - have been mired in time and cost overruns. With lessons learned there and with recent successes such as the Olympics in mind, Britain’s engineering firms are quietly confident that they will do better. It is my hope that construction improvements can indeed be translated into lower costs for later units. For a nuclear renaissance to take hold in Britain, then costs must fall. Those looking at new nuclear power stations for other proposed sites in Britain should plan to receive a lower strike price, not least because they cannot expect the Prime Minister to provide top-level rhetorical support again. That said, the government cannot relax, and with the industry it should now focus on the goal of further new nuclear power stations developed with affordability in mind."

"If you want to get some women mad, there are more ways than by electing Donald Trump. Try doing what The New York Times did: writing a story about a bunch of fathers in Montclair, N. J. who had to endure the hardship of watching their children for a day while their wives attended protest marches in Washington and New York. “In their wake,” the story said, “they left behind a progressive bedroom community with suddenly skewed demographics. Routines were radically altered, and many fathers tried to meet weekend demands alone for a change. ” Poor daddies. Poor kids. The headline on the home page didn’t help matters: “When ‘Mommy Has to March,’ Routines Shift. ” Ouch. The headline on the story was this: “How Vital Are Women? This Town Found Out as They Left to March. ” As you might imagine, the story rubbed more than a few readers the wrong way. Hannah Laurison of Philadelphia had this to say: And here’s Jessica Wilbanks from Houston: “There is so much wrong with this piece that it’s hard to know where to start. How is it a hardship that wealthy men in a privileged community are taking care of their own offspring for less than 24 hours?” Not to be left out, people chimed in on Twitter, including this dad: The Huffington Post beat me to my job with a good piece on the matter that it posted this afternoon. Check it out here. There is pretty much nothing about this piece that I think was wisely considered, for all the reasons readers already articulated. The staff produced some strong, readable coverage of the march in New York, but this wasn’t among it. Here’s the silver lining, and the part I found exhilarating. The Metro editor, Wendell Jamieson, whose section produced the piece, unequivocally acknowledged that it was a mistake. “It was a bad idea from the ” Jamieson said. “It was conceived with the best intentions, but it fell flat. And I regret it. ” Classy. Needless to say, I agree."

Lowering Sea Level For Centuries

“Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away”
— NASA Study: Mass Gains of Antarctic Ice Sheet Greater than Losses

For decades scientists have suggested that the effects of a climatic warming would likely lead to an increase in Antarctica’s surface mass balance (i.e., mass gains exceed losses), and this would lead to a concomitant lowering of sea levels.

Oerlemans, 1982
“The results indicate that a climatic warming will probably lead to a sea-level lowering of some tens of centimetres in the next centuries. This is because for Antarctic conditions the increase in snow accumulation exceeds the increase in melting.”

Huybrechts and Oerlemans, 1990
“According to this mass balance model, the amount of accumulation over the entire ice sheet is presently 24.06 x 1011 m3 of ice, and no runoff takes place.  A 1°C uniform warming is then calculated to increase the overall mass balance by an amount of 1.43 1011 m3 of ice, corresponding to a lowering of sea level with 0.36 mm/yr. A temperature increase of 5.3° C is needed for the increase in ablation to become more important than the increase in accumulation and the temperature would have to rise by 11.4°C to produce a zero surface mass balance.”

Huybrechts et al., 2004
“As a general result, it is found that the effect of increased precipitation on Antarctica dominates over the effect of increased melting on Greenland for the entire range of predictions, so that both polar ice sheets combined would gain mass in the 21st century. The results are very similar for both time-slice patterns driven by the underlying time evolution series with most of the scatter in the results caused by the variability in the lower-resolution AOGCMs. Combining these results with the long-term background trend yields a 20th and 21st century sea-level trend from polar ice sheets that is however not significantly different from zero.”

Lenaerts et al. 2016
“We present climate and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) as simulated by the global, coupled ocean–atmosphere–land Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a horizontal resolution of ∼1∘ in the past, present and future (1850–2100). … CESM [Community Earth System Model] projects an increase of Antarctic ice sheet SMB [surface mass balance] of about 70 Gtyear−1 per degree warming. This increase is driven by enhanced snowfall, which is partially counteracted by more surface melt and runoff along the ice sheet’s edges. This intensifying hydrological cycle is predominantly driven by atmospheric warming, which increases (1) the moisture-carrying capacity of the atmosphere, (2) oceanic source region evaporation, and (3) summer AIS cloud liquid water content.”
“In contrast to Greenland, where increased snowfall currently does not compensate enhanced surface runoff, this increase in AIS snowfall translates almost fully to ice sheet mass gain and mitigation of sea-level rise (Bengtsson et al. 2011; Shepherd et al. 2012). The reason is that rainfall on the AIS remains small, and most of the liquid water produced by surface melt can refreeze in the snowpack. Even in a warmer future, projected surface runoff losses are dominated by mass gains through enhanced snowfall (Ligtenberg et al., 2013).”

Thomas et al., 2017
“The central Antarctic sites lack coherency and are either not representing regional precipitation or indicate the models inability to capture relevant precipitation processes in the cold, dry central plateau. The drivers of precipitation are reviewed for each region and the temporal variability and trends evaluated over the past 100, 200 and 1000 years. Our study suggests an overall increase in SMB [surface mass balance] across the grounded Antarctic ice sheet of ~ 44 GT since 1800 AD, with the largest (area-weighted) contribution from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP).”

"The historic wildfires that have seized the west are delivering a dire message: the climate crisis and decades of bad environmental policies have unleashed deadly consequences. Half a dozen climate scientists, fire ecologists, forest officials and Indigenous fire practitioners interviewed by the Guardian this week described the recent fires in California, Oregon and Washington as alarming but unsurprising. Stephen Pyne, a fire historian, saw the fierce fires as “an ancient plague” reawakened. Chris Field, a climate scientist at Stanford University, said the sheer number and scale of the fires overwhelmed him. “Even as someone whose job it is to study fire, it’s really hard for me to keep up,” he said. “There’s so much death and destruction – and we know what we need to be doing to stop it, but we’re not doing it,” said Don Hankins, a pyrogeographer and Plains Miwok fire expert at California State University, Chico.  Underlying the megafires are two human-caused catastrophes: the climate crisis and a century of fire suppression. Here’s what you need to know to understand the enormity of the challenges. Wildfires burning across the western states are staggering in size – in some cases expanding with such explosive force that they have burned more acreage within a few weeks than what might have previously burned all year. The flames this week belched up enough smoke and soot to temporarily blot out the sun and turn skies orange across the region. In Oregon, fires have burned more than 900,000 acres and leveled entire neighborhoods in what the state’s governor, Kate Brown, described as possibly “the greatest loss of human life and property due to wildfire in our state’s history”. Half a million people – about 10% of the state’s population – were under evacuation orders by Thursday afternoon. Parts of the state that rarely see fires burned with unusual ferocity; the regions south of Portland threatened by the Beechie Creek and Lionshead fires haven’t seen such an intensity of fire in 300 or 400 years, said Meg Krawchuk, a pyrogeographer at Oregon State University. California has seen six of the 20 largest wildfires in its history this year, which have burned a record 3.1m acres. The fires are also hitting before the traditional start of fire season in the fall. “We’re seeing an unprecedented year of fires,” said Frank Lake, a US Forest Service research ecologist. In Washington state, where more than half a million acres have burned, the governor, Jay Inslee, toured a town overrun by the blazes and remarked the region has seen “this trauma all over”. A one-year-old boy died as his family raced to escape fast-moving flames, and hundreds of homes and other structures remain at risk as the fires rage on. The fires this week are raging in 13 western states, according to the National Fire Information Center, and the factors driving them are numerous and varied. But there’s no doubt that “human-caused climate change is a major factor driving these fires”, said Patrick Gonzalez, a forest ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Some of the fires around coastal California were sparked by highly unusual lightning storms that followed a searing heatwave. Others were ignited by humans – but stoked by powerful, dry winds. Drought in many cases played a role. Severe drought contributed to the death over the past decade of about 163m trees in California – and the dead vegetation has probably helped fuel and feed some of the fastest-moving fires. Continuing drought in Oregon dried soils, allowing flames to zip across the landscape unfettered by moisture. “Each fire has a particular ignition, a particular context,” Field said. “But when you step back, a more consistent pattern emerges.” The climate crisis has increased the risks of large, extreme fires, he said, heating and drying the landscape so it’s primed for catastrophe. A 2019 study found that from 1972 to 2018, California saw a fivefold increase in the area burned in any given year – and an eightfold increase in the area burned by summer fires. Another study estimates that without human-caused climate change, the area that burned between 1984 and 2015 would have been half of what it was. And a research paper published last month suggests that the number of autumn days with “extreme fire weather” – when the risk of wildfires is particularly high – has doubled over the past two decades. “Our climate model analyses suggest that continued climate change will further amplify the number of days with extreme fire weather by the end of this century,” the researchers write. “But fires aren’t necessarily surprising,” said Lake, of the forest service. Before European colonization, 4.5m to nearly 12m acres of California would burn annually, researchers have estimated. Most of those fires burned less intensely and many were set intentionally. For thousands of years, hundreds of tribes across California used small controlled burns to clear out fire-fueling vegetation, renew the soil and prevent bigger, runaway wildfires.  “They worked in partnership with nature, when lightning strikes occurred – they let fires burn,” said Hankins, the Plains Miwok fire expert. European settlers disregarded and outlawed the ecological and cultural practice, however. Starting in the 1880s, the US adopted a policy of putting out all fires to protect homes and timber, fining Indigenous people for burning their own lands. California’s forests became unnaturally dense, with overcrowded trees competing for increasingly scarce water. Climate change further degraded the landscape: tree species like the Sequoia, which over thousands of years had adapted to not only survive fires but thrive with them, have been less and less able to withstand progressively hotter, more extreme fires. In tandem, warmer, drier weather and a landscape deprived of fire are wrecking the region. “At three million acres burned this year, we’re still well below what historically burned,” said Hankins. “But the difference now is that all the burning is happening in a short period of weeks and months.” Starved of fire for decades, the land is now bingeing on it. The “nuclear winter” red din across the region this week was harrowing, Hankins said. But he added that “this idea that California is unlivable” because of the fires frustrates him. “In most places in California where these fires are happening, Indigenous people have lived in these places for thousands of years, with fire,” he said. “That’s really, really important for everyone to remember.” Taken all together, the disastrous consequences of climate change and the decades of destructive environmental policies can only be reversed by reshaping society and its relationship with the landscape, said Pyne. He characterized the west as a “fossil fuel society imposed on a fire-prone landscape”. The US spews up about 6,677m metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. It has used destructive gas-powered bulldozers to force itself into fire-prone wildlands, and gas-powered fire trucks to quell natural fires. “Long term, we’re not only going to have to quit our binge-burning fossil fuels, we’re going to have to reshape how we’ve organized society,” he said. Scientists say there are no quick solutions. Fires are going to get fiercer and more frequent in coming years, researchers said in a paper published this year, “though a pathway consistent with the UN Paris commitments would substantially curb that increase”, they reported. Even with dramatic action to curb climate change, the region is likely to get drier and warmer for the next few decades. In the meantime, residents may have to ease out of fire-prone wildlands and build homes that are designed to be more resilient to fires, Pyne said. California will have to renovate its outdated, dangerous electrical grids – which have sparked some of the deadliest and most destructive fires in recent history. And across the west, policymakers will have to restore Indigenous land stewardship and work with Native American fire practitioners to burn more land. So far, progress has been achingly slow, Pyne said. This year California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a memorandum acknowledging the state needed to treat at least 1m acres of California forest and wildlands. One study suggested that to restabilize the landscape, the state might need to burn or treat twenty times that."

I was fortunate to have done most of my globe trotting when I was young. A few trips to Europe, mostly by train in my teens and early twenties, followed by a couple of years living in Hong Kong gave me plenty of opportunity for travel, and by the time I was 30, I had travelled large parts of South East Asia and the west coast of the USA and was now firmly ensconced in New Zealand. I spent the next few years mostly exploring New Zealand itself; what a beautiful and varied country it is, with the subtropical beaches of the north and the majestic scenery of the south. This place is known as Godzone for a very good reason.



But as time passed, and long haul trips became less frequent, I must confess to enjoying the travel less and less. In 1992, I made an urgent trip back to the UK on crowded planes, but by 1999, the planes were even more crowded and there seemed to be much less space. Once we were advised to get up and walk around on long haul flights, but how can you do that when the drinks trolley completely fills the aisles? Having visited Paris in 1975 as a student, it was horrible to have to wait in mile long queues to go up the Eiffel Tower, to be crammed into the elevator like sardines, and then, once at the top, to struggle to find even a small space to take a photo. These things were not worth doing in 1999, and I suspect that they are much worse now.



Until the last few weeks, of course. Here is a snapshot of our world today.



I have always believed in the romance of travel, but there is very little that is romantic about it now. There is nothing romantic about long snaking queues, about having to take your boots off to go through security, to being manhandled and abused by bored customs staff, to having to limit your liquid cosmetics to tiny little bottles (that have to be viewed before you go on the plane), or to having someone else’s kid kick the back of your seat all the way from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. There is nothing romantic about fighting for space in the overhead lockers, or about being abused by the person behind you when you reclined your seat because the person in front of you just reclined theirs. There is nothing romantic about being trapped in a sardine can for 13 hours in the middle of a row. In fact, there is nothing nice about any of it at all.



You can always pay for an upgrade, of course, which will make the flights more comfortable, but that will do nothing about the 40 minute queues to get up the Eiffel Tower. 



The worst thing about all of this is not the discomfort, bad though it is. Tourism is damaging many of the world’s better features. In the desire to go and see some of the earth’s beauty spots, we are ruining many of them for ever.



Think of Machu Picchu. Venice. Easter Island. The Taj Mahal. Or come closer to home and think of Tekapo and Rotorua. I travelled to Central Otago a few years ago and travelled back up the West Coast, calling in on Franz Josef Glacier on the way. There must have been 1500 people there that day. It was madness; no parking and long slow lines of tourists snaking up to view the glacier. This is not the way to view our wonderful wide open spaces.



Why do we do this? For a single photo opportunity? Just to say we have been there?



People keep telling me that the world will be a very different place when we come out of all this. I hope that the travel industry is very different. Air New Zealand has laid off 400 pilots and a lot of other staff, so some of them will not be coming back. It is the same story everywhere. National airlines will survive because their governments will prop them up, but many independent airlines, particularly some of the budget airlines, will never come back. And even though I am a lover of trade, of economic activity and full employment and of enterprise… I say good. The travel industry desperately needs a reset.



I am definitely someone who would be prepared to pay more for a better quality trip. These days, it is either dirt cheap or hugely expensive, and there is not much in between. Why not go back to the days of saving up for a long haul trip, but having planes with a few less passengers and a bit more room? Would it really kill the travel industry to do that?



Not any more, because the travel industry is on life support anyway. 



If we take a look at our own lovely country, the huge numbers of visitors have made the experience downright unbearable in some places. Locals avoid Queenstown like the plague in summer. The only time I ever went on a trip onto Milford Sound, the commentary was in Japanese. There was no English translation. The boat was full of Japanese tourists. They were brusque, rude and seemed to think we had no right to be on the boat. In our own country. In 1999, we flew back to New Zealand via Hong Kong, on Air New Zealand. There was no western food on the menu for the entire trip. We weren’t the only non Chinese travellers on that plane, but if you thought that maybe you were being treated as unimportant on a plane from your own country’s national carrier, then you could be forgiven. The yen and the yuan are so much more important than the kiwi dollar, it would seem.



Travel needs to become an enjoyable experience again. Yes, you can arrange your trip to avoid the crowds, if you can afford to, but you won’t see the big attractions. For the sake of the world’s beauty spots, however, things need to change. And for those who are concerned about carbon dioxide emissions, and have been gleefully blaming the farmers… have you taken a look at the air pollution in Delhi, London, even Auckland recently? Agriculture is not the problem. It has just been the fall guy for climate activists.



How did it all get so bad? And why do we put up with it being the way it is? A few changes would make all the difference. I would like to see the travel industry stop treating people like herded cattle, like cockroaches, like sardines. If changes were ever possible, they are possible now. Then maybe we could bring some romance back into travel, and make it an enjoyable experience once again.

Groucho Marx famously said, “politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies”. We’ve seen this recently in panicked political responses to disasters, real and imagined, which actually cause more harm than that which they’re supposedly remedying. Fukushima, “climate emergency”, the Millennium Bug…



 **Is COVID-19 Millennium Bug 2.0?**



The current coronavirus disease, Covid-19, has been called a once-in-a-century pandemic. But it may also be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco.



[…]How can policymakers tell if they are doing more good than harm?



Vaccines or affordable treatments take many months (or even years) to develop and test properly. Given such timelines, the consequences of long-term lockdowns are entirely unknown.



Well, there’s one known: massive economic disruption. The Millennium Bug cost hundreds of billions in “remedies”. Given that countries like South Korea, which spent almost nothing on “preparedness”, encountered negligible problems, [it seems likely that that was money mostly wasted](https://people.com/human-interest/y2k-millennium-bug-20-year-anniversary/). The Millennium Bug hysteria also caused almost exactly the same panic-buying as we are seeing now.



Like climate change, too, much of the hysteria is being fanned on the basis of very poor evidence.



The data collected so far on how many people are infected and how the epidemic is evolving are utterly unreliable. Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300[…]Reported case fatality rates, like the official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, cause horror — and are meaningless[…]



The one situation where an entire, closed population was tested was the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its quarantine passengers. The case fatality rate there was 1.0%, but this was a largely elderly population, in which the death rate from Covid-19 is much higher.



Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%)[…] **reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%.**



Which means that the Chinese Virus could either be rather less deadly than seasonal influenza, or somewhat worse.



That huge range markedly affects how severe the pandemic is and what should be done. A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza. If that is the true rate, locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational. **It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat. Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.**



A mid-range guess of 0.3% fatality rate translates to about 10 000 deaths worldwide.



This sounds like a huge number, but it is buried within the noise of the estimate of deaths from “influenza-like illness.” If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with PCR tests, the number of total deaths due to “influenza-like illness” would not seem unusual this year. At most, we might have casually noted that flu this season seems to be a bit worse than average. The media coverage would have been less than for an NBA game between the two most indifferent teams.



So are we panicking over nothing much at all?



Governments like big sticks and media love whipping up hysteria, but some minimal safe practises will go a long way to seeing us through the next few months. Wash your hands. Practise social distancing. Stay home unless you need to go out. Don’t panic buy.

One remarkable consequence of the global **Chinese Virus** pandemic is that even the most ardent globalists are suddenly rediscovering that there are such things as borders – and that they matter.



Mexico, which has relentlessly screeched blue murder about Trump’s determination to reinforce the US-Mexico border, suddenly announced that it wanted the border closed. **Emmanuel Macron** began seizing medical supplies _en route_ to Britain. **Jacinda Ardern** announced that New Zealand’s borders were [closed to non-residents](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/03/prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-announces-total-new-zealand-border-closure.html).



All this, after years of singing from the hymn-sheet of a world without borders.



COVID-19 will transform, if not completely kill, globalisation as we have known it. The virus is itself a consequence of globalisation[…]It flew on the wings of globalisation, sailed down globalisation’s every canal, traversed all its highways.



Despite the globalists’ mantra that **a globalised world needs global governance** , globalist institutions like the WHO conspicuously dropped the ball over the Chinese Virus, preferring to parrot Beijing’s propaganda. Instead, now that a global crisis really has hit, it’s **national** governments that citizens have turned to.



First, the centre of every citizen’s sense of accountability for this virus is their national government. No one asks: what is the Indian Ocean Regional Association for co-operation doing about this? They ask: what is Canberra doing?



It is a global pandemic and therefore national governments will need to co-operate. But each nation has taken its own national measures. When the Morrison government first banned direct travel to Australia from China, Beijing was furious. Then a lot of countries did the same.



The poster-child of globalism, the EU, is performing notably badly.



The epicentre of the crisis now is Europe. COVID-19 has been badly managed in Italy and other European nations. This is partly because the bizarre rules of the ­European Union limit what each nation can do. The EU is talking of closing its borders. But European nations cannot close their own borders. Italy cannot close its borders, nor France nor Spain theirs.



Governments, for their part, need to remember that wealth creation is important. Rich countries can afford the robust national health systems needed in a pandemic.



The richer your national government, and the greater the sovereignty and real control it exercises, the better your chances of doing something effective[…]



The left in politics, and the left internationally, tends to take a nation’s wealth as a given, that it is always there. The COVID-19 crisis will starkly demonstrate the limits of our wealth as we pass through the acute phase. More than that, it will severely damage our economy with a big rise in unemployment. People will want jobs and they will look, not to the UN or the EU or climate change agreements, for those jobs. They will want their national government to create conditions that create jobs.



Unfortunately, too many governments are teetering on the edge of [falling off the cliff of economic stimulus](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/we-are-all-ruled-by-beijing-now/) into full-blown “Modern Monetary Theory”. Valuable economic resources are being ploughed into gifting cash windfalls to [people already on welfare](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/more-money-for-beneficiaries/).



But hopefully governments will also discover economic sovereignty. The rush to sell off the family farm and manufacturing to Beijing must be corrected.



For their part, though, citizens must be on their guard against governments that never let a good crisis go to waste.



Structurally, the crisis will see power flow to national capitals everywhere. **Emmanuel Macron** , the French president, repeatedly told his people this week that they were “at war” with COVID-19. That’s the giveaway. For there is one perennial winner in war. If a nation is not wholly destroyed, the national government always emerges stronger, with new powers and new dominance.



It’s the type of government that emerges from the crisis that counts. Will we allow ourselves, under the guise of “stimulus”, to cede the state permanent autocratic power? When WWII ended, **Winston Churchill** was voted out of office. He took it with the kind of grace few politicians today would show: “They have a perfect right to kick me out. That is democracy”.



The lesson **Menzies** took from World War II — the need to build a strong nation — may well be the lesson we take after the virus crisis has passed, whenever that might be[…]Strong, confident nations can co-operate well.



But first and foremost they are nations with national priorities, national personalities, national destinies. In times of crisis, like coronavirus, it is the nation that counts, not globalisation.

"In 1755 a New York City newspaper carried an account of the   of the governors of the newly founded King’s College, which later grew into Columbia University. At the bottom of the page ran an advertisement for a rather different occasion: the sale of “TWO likely Negro Boys, and a Girl. ” The ad would have raised few eyebrows at King’s, where many of the college’s early presidents, trustees, donors and students owned slaves. But now it’s the opening example in a new report detailing Columbia’s historical ties to slavery. The report, to be released by the university on Tuesday as part of a new website, offers no dramatic revelations akin to that of the sale of 272 slaves in 1838 that helped keep Georgetown University afloat and that has raised a contentious debate about reparations today. But it illuminates the many ways that the institution of human bondage seeped into the financial, intellectual and social life of the university, and of the North as a whole. “People still associate slavery with the South, but it was also a Northern phenomenon,” Eric Foner, the Columbia historian who wrote the report, said in an interview. “This is a very, very neglected piece of our own institution’s history, and of New York City’s history, that deserves to be better known. ” Lee Bollinger, the president of Columbia, said that while there were as yet no plans to act on the report, grappling with the university’s “complicity” with slavery was necessary to address current injustice. “Every institution should know its history, the bad and the good,” he said. “It’s hard to grasp just how profoundly our contemporary society is still affected by what has happened over the past two or three centuries. ” Awareness of the ties between slavery and Northern universities has waxed and waned over time. The issue first came to the fore in 2001, when scholars associated with a unionization campaign at Yale issued a report challenging what they considered the university’s   celebration of its abolitionist past. In 2002 Ruth Simmons, the president of Brown, drew headlines with her call for an investigation of that university’s connections at a moment when a major reparations lawsuit against banks and insurance companies was making its way (ultimately unsuccessfully) through federal courts. The political charge surrounding the issue then receded, only to come roaring back in recent years, thanks to student activism and the broader Black Lives Matter movement. Harvard, which installed a plaque last spring honoring four enslaved people who worked on campus in the 1700s, plans to hold a conference on universities and slavery in March. Princeton has commissioned seven plays based on its research into its ties with slavery, which will be released in the fall. “This has become almost a national movement,” said Sven Beckert, a historian at Harvard who led an undergraduate research seminar on Harvard and slavery in 2007. “There is now more of a realization that these issues are in some ways still with us, and that to move forward we need to come to terms with our past. ” The Columbia report had its origins in 2013, when Mr. Bollinger read about Craig Steven Wilder’s book “Ebony  Ivy: Race, Slavery and the Troubled History of America’s Universities. ” He and Mr. Foner invited Mr. Wilder to speak on campus and began discussing the possibility of an undergraduate research seminar to investigate Columbia’s ties further. The report draws on research from that seminar, taught by Mr. Foner in 2015 and, last year, by Thai Jones, a curator in Columbia’s     library. While the story the report tells is complex, the bottom line is blunt. “From the outset,” it declares, “slavery was intertwined with the life of the college. ” The university, while it does not itself appear to have owned slaves, both benefited from   fortunes and actively helped increase them. A 1779 audit by Augustus Van Horne, the college’s treasurer (and a slave owner) showed that the endowment often lent money to alumni and other prominent New Yorkers at   rates, thus “helping subsidize the mercantile and other business activities of men who profited from slavery. ” New York passed a   law in 1799, but some people connected with King’s, the report notes, continued to own slaves. Benjamin Moore, its president, owned two in 1810, according to the census. While information on individual slaves was difficult to find, the website includes a brief section on one named Joe, who came to Kings in 1773 with John Parke Custis, a stepson of George Washington’s. “We didn’t want this just to be about white owners,” Mr. Foner said. The report also discusses Columbians who were involved in antislavery activities, if generally of the more moderate sort. A section on Alexander Hamilton, for example, notes that he joined the New York Manumission Society in 1785 and rejected notions of black inferiority but said nothing about slavery at the Constitutional Convention. In contrast to Columbia’s more recent reputation as a seat of progressive activism, records of student debating societies from the early 1800s show only ”mild hostility to slavery, coupled with opposition to general emancipation,” the report says. The more than 400 notable Columbians listed in a database on the website includes a few   abolitionists, like John Jay II. But there were many more, like William A. Duer, the college’s president in the 1830s (and a slave owner as late as 1814) who supported the colonization movement, which held that blacks should be freed and then sent back to Africa. “One thing that really surprised me was how few Columbians were actually involved in fighting against slavery,” said Mr. Foner, whose most recent book is about the Underground Railroad in New York. The report ends at the Civil War, when most Columbians, the report says, “rallied to the Union cause. ” The research seminar will continue to be held annually, filling in the gaps and pushing the story into the 20th century. Mr. Foner said he hoped the project would look at the impact, not always positive, of Columbia professors’ scholarship on race as well as why the university was slower than comparable institutions to enroll  . “You don’t get the first black undergraduate until 1906,” Mr. Foner said. “I would really like to know more about why. ”"
"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first. ” Those were the words of President Trump at his inauguration on Friday, just as rain began falling in the capital. His forceful address offered a strikingly grim view of the United States, repudiated the establishment and alarmed leaders around the world  —   but also energized his supporters at home and abroad. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first to have never served either in public office or as a military general. _____ 2. Hundreds of thousands of women gathered to protest Mr. Trump in Washington on Saturday, above, and many more demonstrated in cities around the nation and the world. Here is a photographic roundup. On Friday, protests in the capital turned violent at times. Mr. Trump begins his term with less popular support than any new president in modern times. _____ 3. These photos show a much smaller crowd for Mr. Trump’s inauguration than for Mr. Obama’s in 2009. Both were taken 45 minutes before the ceremony. Our reporters noted a “peculiar sensation”  in Washington, where pockets of eerie quiet existed as residents and others skipped town. Mr. Trump and his press secretary falsely claimed that Mr. Trump drew “the largest inaugural crowd ever. ” Mr. Trump also said the media had invented his friction with the intelligence community and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth. ” _____ 4. The mood among Mr. Trump’s supporters was jubilant and beyond. “My savior is born,” yelled Amy Azzo, an Iraqi immigrant who traveled from Michigan for the inauguration. “President Trump  —   I love it. ” Scattered chants of “Lock her up!” came from the crowd, but Hillary Clinton strode on stage with a practiced smile. _____ 5. One of Mr. Trump’s first acts as president was to sign an executive order aimed at scaling back the Affordable Care Act. A report earlier in the week estimated that as many as 18 million people could lose insurance if major provisions of the health care law are repealed. A full digital turnover of whitehouse. gov happened within moments of Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and the official White House Twitter handles also changed over  —   but whether the president will forgo using his personal Twitter account remains unclear. _____ 6. The Senate confirmed the first two cabinet nominees: James N. Mattis as defense secretary, above, and John F. Kelly as homeland security secretary. Democrats delayed a vote on Mike Pompeo’s confirmation as C. I. A. director until Monday. And the Justice Department cleared Mr. Trump’s appointment of his    Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser, saying that the president’s special hiring authority exempted such a position from antinepotism laws. _____ 7. President Trump now oversees  the intelligence agencies that are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions for possible links between his associates and Russian officials. Among those being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, above, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative. It is not clear whether the communications have anything to do with Mr. Trump, but he has the authority to redirect or stop at least some of the efforts. _____ 8. Mr. Obama left for a family vacation in Palm Springs, Calif. after saying goodbye to about 2, 000 political appointees at Joint Base Andrews. The Obamas pledged to build democracy through the Obama Foundation. They will live in Washington. Joe Biden and his wife are looking for a small house in the same neighborhood. As the Obamas and Bidens headed out of town, Mr. Trump and his wife made stops at three official inaugural balls. We   to provide a look at the festivities. _____ 9. And the world keeps turning. Here’s a quick rundown of other top stories: • The Earth hit a record high temperature in 2016, for the third year in a row. • Chelsea Manning was granted clemency and will be released from prison in May. • The Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo was extradited to the United States. • An avalanche buried a hotel in Italy. In Tehran, above, a burning skyscraper collapsed on live TV. • A swarm of tornadoes in the Southeast U. S. killed at least 15 people. • The United States bombed Islamic State training camps in Libya and carried out a punishing airstrike against Al Qaeda in Syria. • At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Britain’s leader argued that the country is committed to free trade and globalization. • In tennis, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic were both knocked out of the Australian Open, and Rafael Nadal advanced. N. F. L. playoffs continue Sunday. _____ 10. Finally, one of our   articles this week was about the thousands of letters mailed to Mr. Obama each day of his presidency. He read 10 a day, selected by staff members and interns tasked with reading every message that arrived. They told the unfiltered story of a nation. “I never thought about how powerful a letter was,” one of the staffers told us. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

In very large type, the _New York Times_ Jan. 16 proclaimed “The warming of Greenland.” But as has become increasingly typical of their reporting on climate change, that’s only about half the news that’s fit to print. 



The big story, of course, is the melting of Greenland’s ice, and threats of a major rise in sea level. After all, if the entire 630,000 cubic miles of it disappeared, the ocean would rise 23 feet. 



The _Times_ relied on an off‐​the‐​cuff estimate of ice loss, given to it by Professor Carl Boggild from the University Center at Svalbard. The _Times_ reported he “said Greenland could be losing more than 80 cubic miles of ice per year.” 



Nowhere did the _Times_ give the amount determined by meticulous analysis of recent satellite data, which is around 25 cubic miles, published by NASA’s Scott Luthcke in _Science_ less than two months ago. 



It then quoted Richard Alley, from Penn State, who reported “a sea‐​level rise of a foot or two in the coming decades is entirely possible.” Wrong. It’s entirely impossible. 



First, the current sea‐​level rise contributed by this amount of ice loss is probably too small to even be able to measure in coming decades. The satellite data show a reduction of 3 hundred‐​thousandths of Greenland’s total ice per year (while Mr. Boggild’s figure “could” be around 12 hundred‐​thousandths [0.000012]). 



Multiplying the satellite‐​based figure by 23 feet gives the annual rise in sea level of .01 inch per year. Averaged over three decades, that’s a third of an inch, which indeed is too small to be detectable. Over a century, the rise becomes a bit more than an inch. Mr. Boggild’s guesstimate yields 31/2 inches per century. 



In fact, there’s nothing very new going on in Greenland. While the _Times_ pays great attention to ice‐​loss in eastern Greenland caused by current temperatures, it conveniently forgets to look at nearby temperature histories. The longest record is from Angmagssalik. In the summer (when Greenland’s ice melts) the temperature has averaged 43.1 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 10 summers. There was one very warm summer, in 2003, but the other nine years aren’t unusual at all. 



From 1930 through 1960, the average was 43.7 degrees. In other words, it was warmer for three decades, and there was clearly no large rise in sea level. What happened between 1945 and the mid‐​1990s was a cooling trend, with 1985–95 being the coldest period in the entire Angmagssalik record, which goes back to the late 19th century. Only in recent years have temperatures begun to look like those that were characteristic of the early 20th century. 



Petr Chylek, from Canada’s Dalhousie University, recently summarized Greenland’s climate history in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_. He wrote that “Although the last decade of 1995–2005 was relatively warm, almost all decades within 1915 to 1965 were even warmer at both the southwestern [Godthab Nuuk] and southeastern [Ammassalik] coasts of Greenland.” 



In fact, the _Times_ could have written pretty much the exact same story in 1948, before humans had much of a hand in anything climatic. That’s when Hans Ahlman wrote, in the _Geographical Journal_ , a publication of the British Royal Geographic Society, that “The last decades have reduced the ice in some parts of Greenland to such an extent that the whole landscape has changed in character.” So it’s hardly something new when the _Times_ reports, almost 60 years later, that temperatures in Greenland “are changing the very geography of coastlines.” 



This isn’t the first time the _Times_ has misled its readers about climate change in high latitudes. On Aug. 19, 2000, based upon reports from a cruise ship floating at the North Pole, they reported that “the last time scientists can be certain that the Pole was awash in water was more than 50 million years ago.” 



The report received top, Page One billing. But in fact, during the end of summer there’s often some open water at very high latitudes. So 10 days later, on Aug. 29, buried on Page D-3, the _Times_ admitted it had misstated the true condition of polar ice and that an ice‐​free North Pole is hardly unprecedented. 



Yet, in the same issue, the newspaper again misled, saying, “The data scientists are now studying reveal substantial evidence that on average Arctic temperatures in winter have risen 11 degrees [F] over the past 30 years.” It claimed its statement was based upon a recent paper published in the journal _Climatic Change_ by University of Colorado’s Mark Serreze. The average winter rise in Mr. Serreze’s paper is 2.7 degrees F. The _Times_ never even retracted its fourfold exaggeration of Arctic warming. Nor did they say there was only one very small area in the Arctic where there was an 11‐​degree rise. 



To most readers, “average Arctic temperatures” means “temperatures averaged over the Arctic,” not temperature change at one location. 



So, the fact the recent Greenland story ignored the historical record and the refereed scientific literature is nothing new. On reporting about polar climate, the _Gray Lady_ has a consistent record of hiding parts of the truth that are inconvenient to whatever story it is trying to sell.

It is time for one last look at the snow graph. It is a little over a month since _The BFD_ [last reported](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/an-update-on-the-end-of-snow/) on the amount of snow in the northern hemisphere winter, so time to look again.



Eyeballing that, it appears to have peaked at 3250 Gigatons, up some 18% on the 1982-2012 average of 2750 Gigatons. Maybe we have not seen the end of snow yet and children will still be able to make ~~snowmen~~ snowpersons next year.



How dare you! What about the recent headlines?



Well we can’t have that now can we? Either it’s ‘worse than we thought’ or it is getting better. After all, snow falls and becomes ice, so what’s the deal?



These headlines are based upon a paper done by a group of scientists running a project called the “ice sheet mass balance inter-comparison exercise” (IMBIE). What does their paper show?



Looks drastic! But …



It is pretty difficult to pin down to the last cubic metre but there some generally agreed estimates of the total ice mass in the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets. Namely approx thirty million cubic kilometres in Antarctica and around a tenth of that, three million cubic kilometres, in Greenland.



One cubic kilometre is about 0.95 Gigatons of ice giving totals of approx 28.5 million gigatons of ice in Antarctica and 2.85 million gigatons in Greenland.



The graphs above show a loss of about 4000 gigatons in Greenland and 2800 gigatons in Antarctica. Percentage-wise that looks about 0.14% up north and 0.001% down south.



That is **total loss** over 38 years for Greenland and 15 years for Antarctica so the annual loss for Greenland is a ridiculously small percentage of less than four thousandths of one percent and less than one thousandth of one percent—something too small to comprehend—for Antarctica.



 **“The rapid ice loss puts the world right on track for the ‘worst case’ climate scenario.”**



Really? One-seventh of one percent over 38 years and one-hundredth of one percent over 15 years are a **worst case climate scenario**?



 **How Dare You?**

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately there have been a tiny handful of readers who seem to have adopted the idea that NTZ is a personal forum they can simply take over. From now on this is no longer the case.
If you have point to make, then make it. There really is no need for anyone to feel he/she is always right and needs to have the last word on every single point.
The purpose of this blog is to show that the science is nowhere near as settled as it is claimed to be, and that the lofty promises made by green energies are not what they are cracked up to be by any measure. The many reports and lists of peer-reviewed publications presented here clearly support that. If you have a hard time with that reality, then I’m very sorry; I can’t help you.
In a true democratic and open society people have the right to dissent without others barging in — like a William Connelly or Dana Nuccitelli — and obstinately demanding the climate science is settled and that we all have to fall into line. Long comment strings will be discarded in the future.
If you really do have so much good stuff to say, then start your own blog. If you’re as good as you think you are, it may well be a smashing success!
We welcome different opinions here, but leave the uncompromising insistence and the need to dominate out. Make your point and move on.
From now on don’t think this is a mike on a podium that you just can grab any time you want, sound off, and expect everyone to nod in agreement.
I think most adults know what proper manners regarding dialogue are, and so there should be no need to put up playground rules on this.

"**Police in Hong Kong have arrested about 300 people and fired pepper pellets amid new anti-mainland unrest.**
Protesters were rallying against a bill on China's national anthem and Beijing's planned introduction of a national security law.
Police said most arrests were on suspicion of unauthorised assembly.
Protesters oppose the anthem bill, which would criminalise insulting it, and the security law, which they fear will strip Hong Kong of basic freedoms.
Meanwhile in the US, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he has certified to Congress that Hong Kong no longer merits special treatment under US law.
""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,"" he said in a statement.
The initial call by demonstrators had been to gather at the Legislative Council (Legco) building in the Central district. But it had been surrounded by riot police and blocked off by water-filled barriers and large protests there failed to materialise.
MPs there have been debating the second reading of the national anthem bill.
Protesters took to the streets, blocking traffic in both Central and Causeway Bay. Police said on a Facebook post they had arrested 180 people there.
They later added that another 60 had been arrested in the Mongkok district for blocking traffic, and 50 more in Wan Chai.
Other arrests were made for suspicion of possessing offensive weapons, including petrol bombs.
Marches and protests have taken place in a number of other districts.
One protester in Central told the South China Morning Post: ""We want to protect our freedom of speech. It will no longer be Hong Kong, but will become just another Chinese city.""
Another demonstrator told Reuters: ""Although you're afraid inside your heart, you need to speak out.""
If it becomes law, anyone who misuses or insults China's national anthem, the March of the Volunteers, would face a fine of up to HK$50,000 (Â£5,237; $6,449) and up to three years in prison.
If it passes the second reading in Legco on Wednesday, it could go to a third reading and a vote early next month.
Hong Kong does not have its own anthem and so the Chinese anthem is sometimes played at events like football matches.
In recent years, the anthem has been booed frequently. A 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifier, for example, saw thousands booing.
Beijing has proposed imposing it in Hong Kong.
It would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion and China says it is needed to combat violent protests that have grown in the territory.
The anti-mainland sentiment was fuelled last year by a proposed - and later scrapped - bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to China.
Critics say the security law is a direct attempt to curtail the freedoms given Hong Kong in the mini-constitution that was agreed when sovereignty was handed back to China in 1997.
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has denied that the law, which is set to go to a vote this week and could be in force as early as the end of June, will curtail the rights of Hong Kongers.
A group of 200 senior politicians from around the world have issued a joint statement criticising China's plan.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the US would announce a ""very powerful"" response to the proposed legislation before the end of the week. China's plans had already been condemned by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who described them as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms.
The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern""."
"WASHINGTON  —   During a private meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, President Trump asserted that between three million and five million unauthorized immigrants had voted for his Democratic opponent and robbed him of a victory in the national popular vote. There is no evidence to support the claim, which has been discredited repeatedly by numerous  . That did not stop Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, from standing by the president’s words on Tuesday during a briefing with reporters at the White House. “As I said, I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has,” Mr. Spicer said. That much appears to be true. Mr. Trump repeatedly raised doubts about the integrity of the American voting system in the period before the election in November and has falsely said since his victory that millions of people voted illegally. Pressed to present the evidence on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer appeared to conflate two different studies that Mr. Trump’s staff had previously cited in defending his claim. “There’s one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens,” Mr. Spicer said. “There’s other studies that have been presented to him. ” Neither study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump’s claim. The first study was conducted in 2014 by professors at Old Dominion University and discussed on Monkey Cage, a blog hosted by The Washington Post. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said they were registered to vote. The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly criticized by political scientists who said that a more careful examination of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections. The second study, conducted in 2012 by the Pew Center on the States, found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or “significantly inaccurate” that more than 1. 8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls and that almost three million were registered in multiple states, probably because they had moved from one state to another. The study did not find evidence that those errors led to voter fraud, however, simply that they presented avoidable costs and inefficiencies in the electoral process. The primary author of the study, David Becker, made that plain in a Twitter post in November. On Tuesday, he wrote on Twitter that voting integrity in the November election had in fact improved. The absence of studies supporting the claim is not all that is working against Mr. Trump. Election and law enforcement officials all over the country, who monitored reports of voter fraud state by state, have said they found no credible evidence of widespread fraud. Mr. Trump’s assertion likewise found little backing from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill. “I’ve seen no evidence to that effect,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters on Monday when asked about the purported voter fraud. In an interview with CNN, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, urged Mr. Trump to “knock this off. ” “This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,” Mr. Graham said, adding that the president needed to present evidence for his beliefs if he was going to continue to profess them. Others simply deflected questions about Mr. Trump’s claims. Asked about the accuracy of the president’s assessment, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, chose to answer a question no one had asked. “It does occur,” he said of voter fraud, declining to quantify the scope. “There are always arguments on both sides about how much, how frequent and all the rest. ”"
"
From the UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA and the department of interchangeable lexicon comes this study that may have merit, except they can’t seem to decide if it is weather or climate having an effect by the way they word it.
Research into extreme weather effects may explain recent butterfly decline
Researchers investigated the impact of Extreme Climatic Events (ECEs) on butterfly populations. The study shows that the impact can be significantly positive and negative, but questions remain as to whether the benefits outweigh the negative effects.
While it is well known that changes to the mean climate can affect ecosystems, little is known about the impact of short-term extreme climatic events (ECEs) such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall or droughts.
Osgur McDermott-Long, PhD student and lead author from the School of Environmental Sciences at UEA, said: “This is the first study to examine the effects of extreme climate events across all life stages of the UK butterflies from egg to adult butterfly. We wanted to identify sensitive life stages and unravel the role that life history traits play in species sensitivity to ECEs.”
The researchers used data from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS), a high-quality long-term dataset of UK butterfly abundances collected from over 1,800 sites across the UK, spanning 37 years, to examine the effects of weather data and extreme events (drought, extremes of rain, heat and cold) on population change.
The team looked at resident species of butterflies, those which only breed once in a year, and those having more than one brood annually. Multi-brood species were found to be more vulnerable than single brood species and in general extremes of temperature rather than precipitation were found to influence changes in butterfly populations.
Dr Aldina Franco, co-author said: “A novel finding of this study was that precipitation during the pupal (cocoon) life-stage was detrimental to over one quarter of the species. This study also found that extreme heat during the ‘overwintering’ life stage was the most detrimental extreme weather event affecting over half of UK species. This may be due to increased incidences of disease or potentially extreme hot temperatures acting as a cue for butterflies or their larvae to come out from overwintering too early and subsequently killed off by temperatures returning to colder conditions.”
In addition to the negative impacts, the authors found that some life stages may benefit from climatic extreme weather, with extreme heat in the adult stage causing a positive population change in over one third of the UK species.
Dr Franco, added: “This is not an unexpected finding given that butterflies are warm loving creatures. Years with extreme warm summers and winters may have mixed effects. For example, this year was terrible for butterflies, although the summer was warm the number of butterflies counted during the Big Butterfly Count was particularly low. Our study indicates that this could have resulted from the detrimental effects of the warm winter, for example the recent low counts1 of Gatekeeper, Common Blue, Comma, Peacock and Small Tortoiseshell butterflies could be explained by our results due to their negative response to warm winters which was just experienced2”.
Mr McDermott Long said: “The study has demonstrated previously unknown sensitivities of our UK butterflies to extreme climatic events, which are becoming more frequent with climate change. Some of these effects are undoubtedly putting future populations at risk, such as extremely warm winters, however we’ve seen that warm and even climatically extreme hot summers may actually benefit butterflies.
Further research is needed regarding the balance of the importance that these variables could have, to see if the benefits of warmer summers will be outweighed by the detrimental winter effects”.
Dr Tom Brereton from Butterfly Conservation and a co-author of the study, said: “If we are to mitigate against extreme events as part of conservation efforts, in particular, we need a better understanding of the habitat conditions which can lead to successful survival of adult, pupal and overwintering life stages of UK butterflies in these situations.”

"■ The federal taxpayer will be defending President Trump in a lawsuit filed against his business ownership. ■ Mr. Trump’s new hotel in Washington lost money in its opening months. ■ Two major donors to the Trump election effort will get plum ambassadorships. The Justice Department will defend President Trump from a new lawsuit that accuses him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and business operations to accept payments from foreign governments, officials said on Monday. But while Mr. Trump said on Monday that the case was “without merit,” a Justice Department spokeswoman, Nicole Navas, declined to comment on it, saying only, “The department is reviewing the complaint and will respond as appropriate. ” The lawsuit, assigned on Monday to Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of President Barack Obama, centers on the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which bars federal officeholders from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. Before his inauguration, lawyers hired by Mr. Trump argued that the clause “does not forbid    transactions with foreign officials,” like paying for hotel rooms. They also said Mr. Trump would donate profits from foreign governments’ patronage to the United States Treasury. But the lawsuit, filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal government corruption watchdog, contends that the clause bars such transactions, too, and that donating profits does not solve the problem. It wants the judge to stop Mr. Trump’s businesses from accepting such payments. It is not clear that Judge Abrams will resolve the dispute over the clause’s meaning. First, she must decide whether the group has suffered enough injury to bring a court challenge. The group argued that it had standing to sue because keeping track of foreign payments to Mr. Trump’s businesses imposed a “significant diversion and depletion of its time, resources and effort. ” It cited a 1982 housing discrimination case as precedent for the idea that an advocacy organization can sue over conduct that drains its resources. But several scholars on Monday noted that Congress had enacted a statute that made it easier to challenge housing discrimination, but not emoluments clause violations. Josh Blackman, a conservative law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, argued in a lengthy blog entry that a “ ” injury  —   like choosing to track certain conduct  —   is generally not sufficient to establish court standing. The Trump International Hotel in Washington took in far less revenue in its first two months than it had projected in estimates it had provided to the General Services Administration, which owns the building, meaning that the hotel lost more than $1. 1 million in September and October, according to a letter that House Democrats released on Monday. The revenue totals, and estimates of expected revenue, were released as the four House Democrats pressed the General Services Administration to explain how it would respond to the apparent breach that has taken place in the lease Mr. Trump has with the agency, given that it contains a clause that appears to prohibit federal elected officials from benefiting from the lease. The Trump Hotel, which opened in September, had estimated that it would generate $6. 4 million in revenue in its first two months, but it collected just $4. 1 million, according to the letter, citing information that Mr. Trump’s company provided to the agency as part of the lease agreement. The hotel had expected about $397, 000 in income through the end of October  —   revenue minus expenses  —   but actually had $1. 16 million in losses. These losses came as the hotel was just opening, a challenging time for any new hotel. And revenues have clearly surged after Mr. Trump was elected and in the time around the inauguration. The House Democrats, led by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked the General Services Administration to explain what action, if any, it plans to take regarding the hotel lease, given the provision that appears to bar a federal elected official from holding it. The agency has so far made no public statement on how it will respond to this apparent breach. The Democrats also released a chart showing the corporate ownership arrangement behind the Trump Post Office LLC, the corporate entity set up by the Trump family to run the hotel. It shows that Mr. Trump, at least at the time he submitted the filing to the General Services Administration, controlled 76 percent of the company, while three of his children each had about 7. 5 percent. A representative from the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump is expected to nominate two private equity executives and major campaign   to the plum diplomatic posts of Italy and Japan. Lewis M. Eisenberg has been chosen to be ambassador to Italy, and William F. Hagerty IV will be nominated to become ambassador to Japan, according to senior White House advisers. Mr. Eisenberg began his career at Goldman Sachs and then   Granite Capital International Group. He was the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks and has long served in top positions in Republican   circles. He led a joint   effort by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee and served on Mr. Trump’s Presidential Inaugural Committee. Mr. Hagerty served as an economic adviser during the administration of President George Bush and then built a career in private equity. He was Mitt Romney’s national finance chairman in 2008 and supported former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in the presidential campaign until Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. He later became director of appointments for the Trump transition team. Early in his career, Mr. Hagerty lived in Japan for three years. Ambassadorships to Italy and Japan are normally considered safe places for     since both countries are allies. But relations with both could prove challenging in the coming years as Italy faces crucial national elections and Japan recovers from Mr. Trump’s cancellation of the   Partnership, a top Japanese priority. Sean Spicer, the new White House press secretary, opened his first full daily briefing with a quick joke about his lack of popularity among the press corps and a break with precedent: The first questions went to friendly outlets, not the wire services. After a very contentious exchange with reporters over the weekend, which drew angry condemnation on social media, Mr. Spicer noted that he had sent an email to Josh Earnest, his Democratic predecessor, who had been voted the most popular press secretary among reporters. “He can rest easy. His title is secure, at least for the next few days,” Mr. Spicer joked. Mr. Spicer largely ignored the longstanding precedent of calling on the wire services, network reporters and major news organizations. Instead, he called on The New York Post first, then the Christian Broadcasting Network. “Our intention is not to lie to you,” he told reporters, after a shaky start this weekend when he inflated the number of people at the president’s inauguration. Mr. Trump issued a fresh tax warning to corporate America on Monday morning, promising that his administration would introduce a “substantial” border tax that would make it expensive for businesses to move factories outside the country. “A company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States and build some factory someplace else, then thinks that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States,” Mr. Trump said  —   “that’s just not going to happen. ” How such a tax would work is in question. Would a company like General Motors that already has a plant in Mexico be hit by the tax, or would it affect only companies that move operations overseas once the law passes? What about Apple, which has contracts with manufacturers in China but doesn’t manufacture there itself? Mr. Trump, who plans to withdraw the United States from the   Partnership trade agreement, rejected the notion that he was   but insisted that his first priority as president is to put American workers first on such deals. “What we want is fair trade” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to treat countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly. ” Trying to ease concerns among American business executives about a border tax, Mr. Trump said that the solution was easy: Stay in the United States. “If you stay here, there’s no tax,” he said. “All you have to do is stay. ” Julia Hahn, a young writer for the website Breitbart, is expected to join the White House as an aide working with her former boss, Mr. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist. Ms. Hahn’s exact title and duties are unclear, although one White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly because Ms. Hahn has not yet been formally hired, said that there were a number of   positions open and she would slide into one. But Ms. Hahn wrote several Breitbart articles savaging House Speaker Paul D. Ryan over his past support for comprehensive immigration reform and his criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign. “He’s With Her: Inside Paul Ryan’s   Campaign to Elect Hillary Clinton President,” blared the headline on one piece in October. During the transition period, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bannon, who was the chairman of Breitbart, are said to have begun to develop a relationship. And aides to Mr. Ryan came away from a meeting on tax reform with Mr. Bannon and other senior advisers to the president describing Mr. Bannon as the only one with a nuanced understanding of policy. Ms. Hahn would represent an expansion of Mr. Bannon’s growing sway within the White House, as he aligns with the president’s    and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to develop a governing philosophy for the new administration. In the 2016 election cycle, Sheldon Adelson, the megadonor and casino magnate, was the nearly $125 million man. Mr. Adelson had a prime seat at Mr. Trump’s swearing in on the West Front of the Capitol last week. And at a dinner honoring Vice President Mike Pence, the president singled out Mr. Adelson in the crowd. He mocked him for having been late to donate but also said that the total amount he gave to “super PACs” was roughly $125 million. Two people close to Mr. Adelson described that figure as accurate. Mr. Trump, in his remarks, went on to criticize super PACs and to describe them as vehicles for consultants to get rich. Mr. Adelson is said to have donated through several vehicles, including to groups supporting congressional Republicans. Still, Mr. Adelson’s largess was consequential to Mr. Trump during the campaign. He was one of the earliest donors to support Mr. Trump, a fellow casino developer, once it became clear he would be the nominee. During difficult stretches toward the end Mr. Trump’s race, when Mr. Adelson was pushed to donate more cash, he expressed concern about doing so unless Mr. Trump gave more of his own money to the campaign, according to two people briefed on those discussions. Mr. Adelson’s singular focus is the safety of Israel, and one of his concerns is that the administration follow through with a vow to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem. Before his rise to Mr. Trump’s White House, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, was known around Washington as the somewhat beleaguered communications chief at the Republican National Committee, and before that, a spokesman around Republican quarters of the House. But his brushes with the news media  —   and ensuing raw feelings  —   go further back than that, to his school days at Connecticut College, where he was a student government senator and his relationship with The College Voice was, shall we say, not terribly cordial. He may have even coined the meme “Sad!” It started in April 1993, when The College Voice’s “This Week in Assembly” column detailed an amendment to ensure that an antismoking regulation would not affect existing rules for the creation of smoking and nonsmoking rooms for exams, sponsored by one “Sean Sphincter. ” That May, The College Voice allowed that Mr. Spicer was “unintentionally misidentified” and that the paper “regrets the error. ” This did not satisfy Mr. Spicer, who dashed off an angry letter to the editor about the article “in which my name was ‘misspelled. ’” “While those involved claimed that this was a copy joke that went unnoticed, I believe that it was a malicious and intentional attack. For a paper which claims to be run by ‘professional’ standards, I find it a bit sad that this type of reporting is explained as a simple part of production. ” The White House press secretary’s emphatic insistence that 1. 5 million people attended Mr. Trump’s inauguration has become quite the national punch line. The Dallas Stars got into the act: So did this guy: Even Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors and former pro player, was having fun with it. Mr. Trump announced that he will nominate former Representative Heather Wilson as secretary of the Air Force, making her the first graduate of the Air Force Academy to serve in the role. Ms. Wilson, a Republican, represented New Mexico in the House from 1998 to 2009 but lost two races for the Senate. Since 2013, she has served as president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Her name had been floated for other administration positions, including director of national intelligence. The new president is still on Twitter, naturally, but he apparently hasn’t decided where his followers are to look. On his old @realDonaldTrump feed on Monday morning, he offered up a little bit of news for the day ahead. The @POTUS account, intermittently used by President Barack Obama and usually a tad dull, has become a propaganda arm of the Trump White House, with exaltations, quotations and photographs  —   and a profile pic of the new president that is pure Trump. The White House did move the president’s initial @realDonaldTrump post on Monday morning to the official account, 23 minutes later. Perhaps his advisers can nudge him away from a personal account that technically he shouldn’t be using, according to the same rules that he cited when he blasted Hillary Clinton for her personal email server. A longer look at his daily schedule is here: Separately, Mr. Trump’s    opposition is pushing #MuteMonday, encouraging people to unfollow @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS, find a new leader to follow and share their choice. The bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate are scheduled to go to the White House on Monday for what is billed as a casual reception with Mr. Trump. At the inaugural luncheon after Mr. Trump’s   on Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spent a good 15 minutes yakking with Mr. Trump, apparently to express displeasure with the president’s cabinet nominees, in particular Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee to be secretary of health and human services. The session will be the president’s first extended opportunity to look for common ground with Democrats, who have denounced his messages and policy priorities, including his executive order on Saturday to pave the way for weakening the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. He will also have a chance to discuss potential bipartisan initiatives, including his $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan. Mr. Trump has high hopes for his relationship with Capitol Hill. He declared on Friday, just minutes after being sworn in, that “we all want the same thing,” regardless of political party, and, “we’re going to get along. ” Monday’s   gathering will be a first test. Mr. Schumer is slated to be at the Monday meeting with Senators Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican Mr. Ryan and Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, and Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the minority whip. Notably, Mr. Trump is set to meet alone with Mr. Ryan afterward. Nominees are likely to be only one of the topics. Mr. Tillerson appears likely to win Senate confirmation, close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and all. But senators are still wary of the Russia connections. Mr. Schumer and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, are introducing legislation that would require a congressional vote to lift the sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and proxy war in that former Soviet state. The two senators will emphasize that the legislation will also cover sanctions imposed just weeks ago by Mr. Obama after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election in hopes of helping elect Mr. Trump. The measure, modeled after a law that required a congressional vote on the Iran nuclear deal, is expected to have bipartisan support, as that legislation did."

The Competitive Enterprise Institute today filed a lawsuit against New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, seeking copies of any agreements his office signed that would protect internal communications stemming from his investigation of ExxonMobil’s climate change record.
CEI’s suit in New York state court comes after Schneiderman denied the conservative think tank’s May 5 request under the state’s freedom of information law for any common interest agreements that his office reached with other state AGs involved in his climate oversight efforts, as well as seven individuals and green groups also involved in Exxon probes.
More than a dozen state AGs signed a common interest agreement earlier this year that allows their offices to shield communications about climate-related investigations, including against Exxon, from public view. CEI and other right-leaning critics of Schneiderman’s investigation slam the pact as an improper secrecy deal, but Schneiderman’s office has countered that common interest agreements are frequently used during multi-state inquiries.
“None of the reasons Schneiderman claimed for withholding these documents are legitimate under New York law,” CEI general counsel Sam Kazman said in a statement on the state court challenge. “The public deserves to know what this AG, and the other AGs cooperating with him, agreed to when it came to targeting their political opponents, and that’s why we sought the Common Interest Agreement in the first place.”

From the Wall Street Journal:
How the Exxon Case Unraveled
It becomes clear that investigators simply don’t know what a climate model is.
By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.
 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s investigation of Exxon Mobil for climate sins has collapsed due to its own willful dishonesty. The posse of state AGs he pretended to assemble never really materialized. Now his few allies are melting away: Massachusetts has suspended its investigation. California apparently never opened one.
The U.S. Virgin Islands has withdrawn its sweeping, widely criticized subpoena of research groups and think tanks. In an email exposed by a private lawsuit, one staffer of the Iowa AG’s office tells another that Mr. Schneiderman himself was “the wild card.”
His initial claim, flounced to the world by outside campaigners under the hashtag “exxonknew,” fell apart under scrutiny. This was the idea that, through its own research in the 1970s, Exxon knew one thing about climate science but told the public something else.
In an Aug. 19 interview with the New York Times, Mr. Schneiderman now admits this approach has come a cropper. He reveals that he’s no longer focusing on what Exxon knew/said but instead on how it goes about valuing its current oil reserves. In essence, Mr. Schneiderman here is hiding his retreat behind a recent passing fad in the blogosphere for discussing the likelihood that such reserves will become “stranded assets” under some imaginary future climate regime.
His crusade was always paradoxical. The oil industry reliably ranks last in Gallup’s annual survey of public credibility. The $16 million that Exxon spent between 1998 and 2005 to support organizations that criticized speculative climate models is a minuscule fraction of the propaganda budgets of the U.S. Energy Department, NASA, NOAA, EPA, not to mention the United Nations’ climate panel, etc. etc.
The episode ends happily, though, if Mr. Schneiderman’s hoped-for political career now goes into eclipse. But we haven’t finished unless we also mention the press’s role.
The “Exxon knew” claim, recall, began with investigative reports by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, both suffering from the characteristic flaw of American journalism—diligently ascertaining and confirming the facts, then shoving them into an off-the-shelf narrative they don’t support.
We have since learned that both the L.A. Times (via a collaboration with the Columbia School of Journalism) and InsideClimate News efforts were partly underwritten by a Rockefeller family charity while Rockefeller and other nonprofit groups were simultaneously stoking Mr. Schneiderman’s investigation.
When caught with your hand in the cookie jar in this way, there’s only one thing to do, and last week the Columbia School of Journalism did it, awarding a prize to InsideClimate News.
For this columnist, however, the deeper mystery was cleared up last year when I appeared on the NPR show “To the Point” to discuss the subject “Did Exxon Cover Up Climate Change?” (Google those phrases) with ICN’s “energy and climate” reporter Neela Banerjee.
Ms. Banerjee has been collecting plaudits all year for her work. The work itself involved revisiting Exxon’s climate modeling efforts of the 1970s. Yet, at 16:28, see how thoroughly she bollixes up what a climate model is. She apparently believes the uncertainty in such models stems from uncertainty about how much CO2 in the future will be released.
“The uncertainties that people talk about . . . are predicated on the policy choices we make,” namely the “inputs” of future CO2.
No, they aren’t. The whole purpose of a climate model is to estimate warming from a given input of CO2. In its most recent report, issued in 2013, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assumes a doubling of atmospheric CO2 and predicts warming of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius—i.e., an uncertainty of output, not input.
What’s more, this represents an increase in uncertainty over its 2007 report (when the range was 2.0 to 4.5 degrees). In fact, the IPCC’s new estimate is now identical to Exxon’s 1977 estimate and the 1979 estimate of the U.S. National Research Council.
In other words, on the crucial question, the help we’re getting from climate models has not improved in 40 years and has been going backward of late.
For bonus insight, ask yourself why we still rely on computer simulations at all, rather than empirical study of climate—even though we’ve been burning fossil fuels for 200 years and recording temperatures even longer.
OK, many climate reporters have accepted a role as enforcers of orthodoxy, not questioners of it. But this colossal error not only falsifies the work of the IPCC over the past 28 years, it falsifies the entire climate modeling enterprise of the past half-century.
But it also explains the non sequitur at the heart of the InsideClimate News and L.A. Times exposés as well as Mr. Schneiderman’s unraveling investigation. There simply never was any self-evident contradiction between Exxon’s private and public statements. In emphasizing the uncertainty inherent in climate models, Exxon was telling a truth whose only remarkable feature is that it continues to elude so many climate reporters.

"Wildlife populations are in freefall around the world, driven by human overconsumption, population growth and intensive agriculture, according to a major new assessment of the abundance of life on Earth. On average, global populations of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles plunged by 68% between 1970 and 2016, according to the WWF and Zoological Society of London (ZSL)’s biennial Living Planet Report 2020. Two years ago, the figure stood at 60%. The research is one of the most comprehensive assessments of global biodiversity available and was complied by 134 experts from around the world. It found that from the rainforests of central America to the Pacific Ocean, nature is being exploited and destroyed by humans on a scale never previously recorded. The analysis tracked global data on 20,811 populations of 4,392 vertebrate species. Those monitored include high-profile threatened animals such as pandas and polar bears as well as lesser known amphibians and fish. The figures, the latest available, showed that in all regions of the world, vertebrate wildlife populations are collapsing, falling on average by more than two-thirds since 1970. Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. “Without biodiversity, there is no future for humanity,” says Prof David Macdonald, at Oxford University. It is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then individual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment.  Without plants there would be no oxygen and without bees to pollinate there would be no fruit or nuts. The services provided by ecosystems are estimated to be worth trillions of dollars – double the world’s GDP. Biodiversity loss in Europe alone is estimated to cost the continent about 3% of its GDP, or €450m (£400m) a year. The extinction rate of species is now thought to be about 1,000 times higher than before humans dominated the planet, which may be even faster than the losses after a giant meteorite wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago. The sixth mass extinction in geological history has already begun, according to some scientists, with billions of individual populations being lost. Researchers call the massive loss of wildlife a “biological annihilation”.  Changes to the climate are reversible, even if that takes centuries or millennia, and conservation efforts can work. But once species become extinct, there is no going back. Robin Freeman, who led the research at ZSL, said: “It seems that we’ve spent 10 to 20 years talking about these declines and not really managed to do anything about it. It frustrates me and upsets me. We sit at our desks and compile these statistics but they have real-life implications. It’s really hard to communicate how dramatic some of these declines are.” Latin America and the Caribbean recorded the most alarming drop, with an average fall of 94% in vertebrate wildlife populations. Reptiles, fish and amphibians in the region were most negatively affected, driven by the overexploitation of ecosystems, habitat fragmentation and disease. Africa and the Asia Pacific region have also experienced large falls in the abundance of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles, dropping 65% and 45% respectively. Europe and central Asia recorded a fall of 24%, while populations dropped 33% on average in North America. To form the Living Planet Index (LPI), akin to a stock market index of wildlife, more biodiverse parts of the world, such as tropical regions, are given more weighting. Experts said the LPI was further evidence of the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, with one million species at risk because of human activity, according to the UN’s global assessment report in 2019. Deforestation and the conversion of wild spaces for human food production have largely been blamed for the destruction of Earth’s web of life. The report highlights that 75% of the Earth’s ice-free land has been significantly altered by human activity, and almost 90% of global wetlands have been lost since 1700. Mike Barrett, executive director of conservation and science at WWF, said: “Urgent and immediate action is necessary in the food and agriculture sector. All the indicators of biodiversity loss are heading the wrong way rapidly. As a start, there has got to be regulation to get deforestation out of our supply chain straight away. That’s absolutely vital.” Freshwater areas are among the habitats suffering the greatest damage, according to the report, with one in three species in those areas threatened by extinction and an average population drop of 84%. The species affected include the critically endangered Chinese sturgeon in the Yangtze River, which is down by 97%. Using satellite analysis, the report also finds that wilderness areas – defined as having no human imprint – only account for 25% of the Earth’s terrestrial area and are largely restricted to Russia, Canada, Brazil and Australia. Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “We are wiping wildlife from the face of the planet, burning our forests, polluting and over-fishing our seas and destroying wild areas. We are wrecking our world – the one place we call home – risking our health, security and survival here on Earth.” Sir David Attenborough said that humanity has entered a new geological age – the anthropocene – where humans dominate the Earth, but said it could be the moment we learn to become stewards of our planet. “Doing so will require systemic shifts in how we produce food, create energy, manage our oceans and use materials. But above all it will require a change in perspective,” he wrote in a collection of essays accompanying the report. “The time for pure national interests has passed, internationalism has to be our approach and in doing so bring about a greater equality between what nations take from the world and what they give back. The wealthier nations have taken a lot and the time has now come to give.” While the data is dominated by the decline of wildlife populations around the world, the index showed that some species can recover with conservation efforts. The blacktail reef shark in Australia and Nepalese tiger populations have both shown signs of recovery. ZSL research associate Louise McRae, who has helped compile the LPI for the last 14 years, said: “Whilst we are giving a very depressing statistic, all hope is not lost. We can actually help populations recover. “I feel frustrated by having to give a stark and desperate message but I think there’s a positive side to it as well.” A separate study released today by Newcastle University and BirdLife International says that at least 28 bird and mammal extinctions have been prevented by conservation efforts since the UN Convention on Biological Diversity came into force in 1993.

"When the Ecuadorian Congress this month voted overwhelmingly to allow drilling for oil underneath the Yasuni National Park, it signalled the failure of a novel conservation proposal unlike any the world had seen before. Launched in 2007 the Yasuni-ITT initiative was a bold proposal that asked the international community to pay Ecuador US$3.6 billion over a 13 year period to compensate for leaving around 860m barrels of oil in the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (or ITT) oil field where it lies, beneath the national park. Declared an ecological reserve by UNESCO in 1989, Yasuni, in the eastern Amazon, is the most biodiverse region in the Western hemisphere. It is home to more native tree species in one hectare than are present in all of North America. Significantly for indigenous rights activists, within Yasuni’s nearly one million hectares lie the ancestral homelands of many indigenous communities, two of which live in voluntary isolation. The rationale behind the initiative was that leaving the oil underground would prevent the emission of a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, a benefit to the planet as a whole. In exchange, the developed world’s payments into a UNDP-monitored trust fund would provide finance for much-needed social and environmental programmes. In August, Ecuador’s president Rafael Correa decided it was time to drill, an announcement deemed inevitable by those who’d watched the progress of Chinese company PetroOriental as it built, from as early as last year, an extraction corridor to service the site. The Ecuadorian administration was adamant from the start that drilling would go ahead if the international community did not pay sufficient funds. Despite generous pledges from Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy, the fund was hundreds of millions of dollars short of the 2012 target of US$291 million. A typically fiery Correa announced: “We have no choice but to drill. The world powers’ hypocritical capitalism has not assumed responsibility.” Some observers have argued that the initiative collapsed because the government invoked the possibility of drilling frequently enough to lead investors to either doubt its commitment to conservation, or to feel unnecessarily blackmailed. Others have argued it was doomed from the start with Ecuador’s hands essentially tied by its reliance on Chinese investment. Throughout the region, China has rapidly replaced the IMF as the major loan provider. Governments are increasingly accused of docility in the face of Chinese investors - many Ecuadorians believe the oil had been sold long before the initiative’s end. In truth, it was highly unlikely to succeed. Ecuador is at the forefront of a global movement that recognises the inherent rights of ecosystems (in 2008 it became the first country in the world to grant constitutional rights to nature). But the Yasuni-ITT proposal sat uneasily between rights-based and market-based approaches to conservation. The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but this ambiguity left the government committed to the contradictory position that Yasuni’s natural rights (as constitutionally enshrined) would be violated if they were not adequately paid for, or indeed whenever they stood in the way of “the national interest”. Despite statements at Rio+20 and elsewhere that the initiative would protect the rights of nature, the drilling is going ahead on the grounds that the developed world has failed to pay what it owes for the protection of those rights. It is true that, as Correa said, the west has failed and continues to fail in their “climate debt” to Ecuador, and to the developing world more broadly. The west has yet to recognise their “common but differentiated responsibilities” for climate change. Equally, as a global community we have only just begun to think creatively about how legal instruments can protect environmental rights, how economic mechanisms can ensure robust valuations of ecosystem services, and how these can work together. Perhaps the most important lesson from Yasuni is that the really difficult work of building a post-petroleum economy involves imagining how broadly, under what conditions, in which forums, and at what scales citizens should try to redefine their national interest. As Ecuador’s opposition movement has pointed out, in a citizen’s revolution surely it is all of Ecuador who should decide whether drilling is or is not in the national interest. It is toward this end that the growing movement known as Yasunidos has begun the work of collecting the required 680,000 signatures (5% of the national electorate) that would allow them to hold a public referendum on the matter.  Recall that Yasuni’s biodiversity is a direct result of the region’s unique climatic stability over many millions of years. Even by optimistic predictions, the oil drilled for beneath it will run out in just 13 years. Given that comparison, who gets to determine what is in the national interest, and over what time scales? The Yasuni-ITT initiative was simply an idea ahead of its time, one that has demonstrated – yet again – the developed world’s lack of commitment to addressing climate change. Nevertheless, the discussion of democratic decision-making around non-negotiable rights and ecosystem services it has provoked is one that may prove of global significance in the years to come."

In all the noise and alarm over the [Chinese Virus](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/coronavirus-is-the-chinese-virus/) it’s easy to miss that one notable din has gone suddenly quiet. Anyone heard from the Krazy Klimate Kult lately?



While we’re all locking ourselves indoors, we might have missed that there’s a sudden dearth of blue-haired land-whales and effeminate milksops glueing themselves to roads. While trying to keep up with what’s locked down, who’s infected and what we’re gonna wipe our arses on, we could be excused for not noticing that the incessant yammering about a “climate emergency” has suddenly been stilled.



But, just when we need some light and relief in these dark times, we have been mercifully relieved of the sight of pig-faced teenagers screeching, “How dare you!” and stamping their little feet.



Typical, really: just when a **real** crisis hits, these know-it-all brats have disappeared faster than a teenager at washing-up time.



What happened to Egg Boi? The school kids who marched against **Morrison** , have you seen them? And of **Greta** , what news? The complete absence of young people from the international conversation on coronavirus is conspicuous.



For some years now we have become accustomed to our media outlets informing us on a regular basis of the thoughts of today’s celebrity youth on our various faults and failings. The ridiculous sight of Greta lecturing grown men and women had come to lose its shock.



Now, her absence from serious debate on a crisis facing humanity comes as something of a shock itself. Indeed our newsfeeds now seem to have completely abandoned youthful spokesmen and women altogether.



Are we not taking our lead from people who have their breakfast made for them anymore? The more accurate question might be ‘were we ever?’



Perhaps we ought not be too hard on the kiddies. After all, adolescence is a time of life when arrogance and ignorance reach their peak confluence. It’s up to adults to, gently or otherwise, remind these overgrown children that they really don’t know as much as they think they do.



The only problem was that, in the absence of anything genuinely serious to worry about, the self-appointed ‘gatekeepers’ of public discourse shamefully fawned at the feet of vain, moronic brats.



It is a shame and a shameful inditement [sic] on our media sources that it has taken something as devastating as the coronavirus outbreak to return their viewers eyes and ears to informed judgement. But here we are.



One cannot hope a child to understand the impacts of over-dependence upon globalist beliefs. It will soon seem bizarre to us that we once thought a child could understand the equally complex issue of climate change. But there we were.



The coronavirus outbreak will change many things in ways we can not yet predict. The media’s focus will be one of them.



Well, there’s one thing about the media which we can always rely on, as sure as night follows day: **whatever it is, it’s Trump’s fault**.

"Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, Earth and its inhabitants have benefited from the rise in airborne CO2 by an average growth increase of about 12% for plants and 18% for trees. This has improved Earth’s habitats and ecosystems, including increasing food production for an undernourished population. These benefits have helped offset the many negative impacts upon nature caused by other human activities.
These are some of the many benefits of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere:

Additional CO2 causes an astonishing increase in plant growth.
More CO2 causes plants to need less water to produce the same amount of growth.
Certain health-promoting substances such as vitamin C and antioxidants, are increased with additional airborne CO2.
With much more food production per acre, Earth should be able to feed an expanding population and save habitats and ecosystems.
Existing habitats and ecosystems will have higher plant and wildlife capacity.
The greening of Earth will continue and extend into the deserts as plants become drought tolerant.
Plants can better resist various stresses when grown in a CO2 enriched atmosphere.
Dramatic increases in the growth of Earth’s forests will help them recover from recurring natural disasters and aid a renewable resource industry.
CO2 is Earth’s greatest airborne fertilizer.
CO2 is the staff of life for Earth’s plant kingdom which is the beginning of the food chain; without it there would be no life on Earth.

A radioactive sign hangs on barbed wire outside a café in Pripyat. Diana Markosian [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsGuest essay by Eric Worrall
One of the problems with renewables is the enormous amount of space renewable installations require. Gathering low intensity power requires a lot of real-estate. But solar entrepreneurs and the Ukrainian Government think they have a solution – they want to build the world’s largest solar plant on land nobody in their right mind would want; the site of the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster.
Chernobyl could be reinvented as a solar farm, says Ukraine
Ministers create presentation to show how idle land around nuclear disaster site can be used to produce renewable energy.
The contaminated nuclear wasteland around Chernobyl could be turned into one of the world’s largest solar farms, producing nearly a third of the electricity that the stricken plant generated at its height 30 years ago, according to the Ukrainian government.
In a presentation sent to major banks and seen by the Guardian, 6,000 hectares of “idle” land in Chernobyl’s 1,000 square km exclusion zone, which is considered too dangerous for people to live in or farm, could be turned to solar, biogas and heat and power generation.
Pressure has been mounting for years to allow industrial development, but no indication is given of where the solar panels would be located. “There has been a change in the perception of the exclusion zone in Ukraine. Thirty years after the Chernobyl tragedy [it] reveals opportunities for development. A special industrial area is to be created in compliance with all rules and regulations of radiation safety within the exclusion zone,” says the presentation.
…
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) this week indicated it would be prepared to lend money for the renewable energy plan. The EBRD has already provided more than $500m (£379m) to build a large stainless steel “sarcophagus” over the destroyed reactor, which will remain dangerous for thousands of years.

The Ukraine is desperately poor, so the Ukrainian government should have no problem finding thousands of workers willing to risk their health, to construct this new green power monstrosity.
And who knows, maybe the idea will catch on – no doubt there are other highly contaminated industrial disaster sites around the world, which could be profitably converted into renewable installations.

"Britain’s housing stock is old and leaky. The vast majority fails to meet modern energy efficiency standards, is responsible for over a quarter of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, and is often very expansive to heat. Plagued by problems of century-old design and building techniques, such as solid walls (less able to retain heat than modern cavity walls) and draughty gaps around windows and doors, the worst examples are referred to as “hard to treat”. These are the buildings the energy companies must help insulate under the government’s ECO scheme, costs which the Big Six claim are pushing up bills. But whoever pays the bill, the government needs to address these buildings if they are to hit its carbon emissions reduction targets. But while these schemes aim to improve buildings and bring down energy use, there’s been little effort to change householders’ behaviour to do the same. The University of Salford’s Energy Hub research group has been investigating this with its ground-breaking Energy House. Researchers study how technology like insulation can help reduce fuel poverty and reduce carbon emissions, but also involve psychologists to examine behaviour patterns to reveal other ways people can reduce their energy bills. The house is a traditional 1900s, end-terrace, two bedroom property inside a climate controlled chamber. Representative of 21% of Britain’s housing stock, it was rebuilt inside the lab using the traditional methods of the time, including lime mortar, and lath and plaster ceilings. The temperature within the chamber can be controlled from -10°C to +30°C, and its humidity can be controlled from 10% to 80%. The Energy House (1, Joule Terrace) has solid brick external walls, a mixture of brick and plasterboard internal walls, single-glazed sash windows, and timber floors. The loft is insulated with typical 100mm mineral wool, and the house is decorated, furnished and to all intents and purposes fully functional. There is an adjoining property also present to one side of the Energy House, an empty insulated space used to house monitoring equipment. Throughout the house is fitted with numerous sensors and devices to monitor the temperature. Our experiments measure the effects on energy consumption of typical householders’ behaviour in the home. We simulated three days in the life of two hypothetical couples living in the home, who keep typical hours but live in different ways.  The two couples’ habits were based on data and anecdotes supplied by the Energy Saving Trust and National Energy Action. Ern and Grace are energy savers – well aware of how to set timers and thermostats, understand that it’s important to keep doors and windows closed as much as possible, and maintain good habits and aren’t wasteful when cooking and washing, or when heating and lighting the building. In other words, they’re mindful of costs. Bern and Savannah on the other hand like to run their home hot, keep thermostats and radiators turned up and run the boiler all day. They often leave windows and doors open for periods of time, and prefer baths to showers. In the kitchen, they like a full kettle of boiling water even for a single cup, and the oven gets left on longer than necessary. In short, they don’t care. The data collected in real time from devices monitoring electricity, gas, temperature and humidity revealed just how much of a cash difference small changes could make. Mindful Ern and Grace used 213.3kWh in three days, made up of 10.3kWh electricity and 203kWh gas. Wasteful Bern and Savannah used 355.28kWh in three days, 28.28kWh in electricity and 327kWh in gas – two thirds more. Assuming most people turn on their heating in October and off in March, and using prices from British Gas in May this year (gas at 4.27p/kWh, electric at 12.797p/kWh), this runs to costs of more than £440 during the colder months of the year. Add in non-heat related savings from better electricity use as well, and this would likely push the annual saving to over £600. As it gets colder this winter, that – an annual saving on an average energy bill of almost 50% – is something to get hot and bothered about."

Here’s the transcript of a Q/A by Al Gore last night on _Larry King Live_



UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Vice President Al Gore, what issues caused by climate change globally are likely to affect the United States security in the next 10 years?   
  
  
KING: Al?   
  
  
GORE: You know, even a one‐​meter increase, even a three‐​foot increase in sea level would cause tens of millions of climate refugees.   
  
  
If Greenland were to break up and slip into the sea or West Antarctica, or half of either and half of both, it would be a 20‐​feet increase, and that would lead to more than 450 million climate refugees.   
  
  
The direct impacts on the U.S. have already begun. Today, 49 percent of America is in conditions of drought or near drought. And we have had droughts in the past, but the odds of serious droughts increase when the average temperatures go up, as they have been going up.   
  
  
We have fires in California, in Florida, in other states, unprecedented fire season last year, directly correlated with higher temperatures, which dry out the soils, dry out the vegetation.   
  
  
We have a very serious threat of losing enough soil moisture in a hotter world that agriculture here in the United States would be greatly affected. Now, the list is too long to give you here, but look, these issues are more important that Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton, and they are not being talked about.



FACT 1. There is not one shred of evidence in the refereed scientific literature speaking of a three‐​foot increase in sea level in ten years. The best estimates from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change range from 0.8 to 1.7 INCHES.   
  
  
FACT 2. There is no trend towards increasing drought area in the United States that is related to planetary warming. We have good data on drought area back to 1895. The correlation between the area of the U.S. under drought and planetary temperature is statistically ZERO.   
  
  
FACT 3. As the mean planetary temperature has warmed since 1975, U.S. crop yields have INCREASED significantly, just as they did during the period of cooling from 1945 through 1975, or during the warming from 1910 to 1945.   
  
  
It is a true outrage that Gore can get away with this on live television and not be called out by the inconvenient facts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOfficial weather offices report that April mean temperatures were colder than normal across Central Europe.
Germany
According to the preliminary results for April, 2017, from Germany’s DWD national weather service, the month came in at a mean temperature of 7.5°C for the central European country, or 0.8°C colder than the 1981-2010 mean of 8.3°C. This makes the month completely NOT in line with the warming that Germany’s DWD expects.
After a record warm March, the DWD wrote in its March report that it was all expected as part of climate change. For April they made no mention of global warming, citing weather patterns.
The DWD wrote that in April “drought, snow and reoccurring frosts” placed a “considerable burden on the the plant world“. In the southern Black Forest region, especially in Singen and Buchenbach, new record lows were set for April. Nationwide April’s low temperature was set in Oberstdorf: -10.1 °C.
Austria
Meanwhile Alps-dominated of Austria saw it’s coldest April in 9 years – and the coldest in the current decade, according to the preliminary April results form the Austrian ZAMG national weather service.
New cold temperature records for the second half of April were set at the airports in Graz and Innsbruck at -5.5 °C and -4.4 °C respectively.
“Extreme” snow amounts
Although frosty temperatures and snow are not unusual in April, the ZAMG writes that the new snow amounts on April 19 and 20 were in part very unusual, especially in the area im Gebiet of the Ybbstaler Alps and extending to the Wienerwald. For example in Lunz am See (612 m) it snowed 65 cm within 24 hours. That would be an extremely high value even for an entire winter month. On April 20 there was 86 cm of snow on the ground in Lunz am See. This has never happened in the second half of April since measurements began in 1896.

The ZAMG reports that the severe late April cold snap caused “widespread frost damage” to many fruit plants.
Switzerland, Italy
Meteo Suisse has not yet released it’s preliminary April report, as this is done typically around the 10th of the following month. But media reports show that the late April cold and frost did not spare Switzerland or northern Italy.
Bitter cold and crop destruction occurred in hard hit Switzerland. According to the online NZZ here, as a cold wave in the second half of April “caused great damage to fruit and vineyards in large parts of Switzerland“.
“Nightmare” for Italian vineyards

The cold wave also hit Italy’s farmers at a bad time, the NZZ reports, as some regions saw temperatures fall below zero and was accompanied by by icy winds. Frost destroyed the early white budding grape varieties such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Pinot grigio. Also red grape sorts such as Cabernet and Merlot were hit, the NZZ reports.
The NZZ characterized the the vineyard damage as dramatic in the regions of Val d’Aosta and Friuli Venezia Giulia, where it reports that “many crops froze”.
In Piemont foremost in the region around Asti and Barolo there was heavy damage. In Lombardy the provinces of Padua, Mantua and Modena are hard hit.”
Here in the Lower Saxony flatlands of northern Germany, I had to keep sensitive garden plants covered overnight on at least 4 occasions over the second half of April.

"**China is facing mounting criticism over a planned security law for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory.**
The UK and US said at a private session of the UN Security Council that the law would curtail the city's freedoms.
China, which blocked a formal meeting, warned them to ""stop interfering"".
Hong Kong's autonomy is guaranteed by the 1997 agreement under which it was returned to China from the UK.
It enjoys some freedoms - of the press and association - unseen in mainland China.
But there are fears the proposed law - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could end Hong Kong's unique status.
This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law, it could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders a path to UK citizenship.
There are 350,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who currently have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa.
On Friday, the UK Home Office confirmed the new rights could be given to up to three million people with BNO status - as long as they applied for and were granted a passport.
China says all BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals, and if the UK changes this practice, it would violate international law.
Australia, Canada and the EU have also criticised the security law and its implications for Hong Kong.
Taiwan's parliament has backed a plan to offer sanctuary to people who want to flee Hong Kong, but China - which considers Taiwan to be part of its own territory - has warned the island not to get involved.
On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian urged other countries to stop interfering in the matter.
""We will take necessary measures to resolutely counter the wrong acts of external forces interfering in Hong Kong affairs"", he said.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong no longer merited special treatment under US law, potentially paving the way for it to be stripped of trading privileges such as lower tariffs than mainland China.
US media reports that President Trump is considering a range of sanctions. These could include strong measures such as stripping Hong Kong of its trading privileges or milder options such as restricting visas and freezing the assets of Chinese officials.
He is expected to make an announcement later on Friday.
The EU has warned that imposing sanctions would not solve the crisis.
""Our relationship with China is based on mutual respect and trust... but this decision calls this into question and I think that we have to raise the issue in our continued dialogue with China"", EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said after talks with foreign ministers on Friday.
Hong Kong's justice secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese service that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable.
""Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone"".
China's parliament has backed the security legislation, which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong.
The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time.
Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September.
However, it is expected to criminalise:
Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform.
China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless""."

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently returned from a junket to Greenland, where, among other things, she says she “saw firsthand evidence that climate change is a reality.” True enough, Madame Speaker, but you didn’t see.



New satellites tell us that Greenland — mainly southern Greenland — is shedding ice at the rate of 25 cubic miles per year. If Greenland lost most of its ice, sea levels would rise 20 feet or so. Greenland is by far the largest mass of ice in the Northern Hemisphere, with roughly 10 percent of the world’s total.



Greenland’s total ice volume is 680,000 cubic miles, and it is losing four ten–thousandths of its ice per year. Do the math. That works out to 0.4 percent of its total mass per century.



Never mind that the most recent study of Greenland indicates that even this minuscule rate may have slowed. Pelosi is falling victim to the common misconception that a slight, additional warming of Greenland will lead to the biblical flood, pronto.



 **Greenland warmer for 50 years**



That’s the horror–show scenario driving the hysteria. How well does it stack up against the facts?



Data from the United States’ National Climactic Data Center show that temperatures in Greenland for the last decade are hardly unusual when compared to temperatures for the last 100 years. The period from 1915 through 1965 — an entire half–century — was about two degrees warmer than it is today.



Where, at that time, was the catastrophe? With the exception of a few geographers, no one noticed. Where was the acceleration in sea‐​level rise? There was none. In 1948, Hans van Ahlmann published a paper in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society commenting upon the loss of ice from coastal fjords and the arrival of fish associated more with warmer waters, noting that there was an increase in habitable land.



In 2000, Glen MacDonald and several coauthors published an eye–opening perspective on the climate history of the Eurasian arctic in the highly respected journal _Quaternary Research_ (“quaternary” is the era of recent ice ages, beginning about 1.8 million years ago) in which they examined radiocarbon dates of old trees deposited in the tundra, far north of today’s northernmost trees. In that region, the tree line is generally over 100 miles south of the Arctic Ocean. But for much of the era from 3,000 to 9,000 years ago, the forest extended right to the sea.



Summer temperatures — the same ones that melt Greenland’s ice — are what determine the Northern treeline. MacDonald had to conclude that “Over much of northern Eurasia [during that period], summers may have been 4.5 to 12.6°F warmer than today.”



Moreover, they wrote that the only way this could occur was if there was a massive incursion of warm (Gulf Stream) water into the Arctic Ocean. How does such water get there? By passing between Greenland and Europe. It’s the only way.



So Greenland had to have been much warmer than it is now for six millennia. Again, where are the records of unprecedented rises in sea level? There aren’t any, because there wasn’t any. Sea levels rose to roughly where they are today.



 **A deafening silence**



The true history of Greenland makes one thing clear: there’s no climate emergency, and therefore no need to legislate draconian regulations on energy use that will dramatically affect almost every aspect of our lives. Further, no one has demonstrated that we even have the ability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the amount necessary to curtail a substantial portion of Greenland’s future warming.



If you can’t do something, why bother? Symbolism costs money and takes away the capital that could be used in the future for investment in real, though yet unknown, energy technologies.



If Pelosi wants to do something about the Earth’s climate, rushing the world toward a failed policy rooted in junk science is about the worst thing imaginable.

Hypsithermal, Altithermal, Holocene Optimum, Holocene Thermal Maximum, Holocene Megathermal, Anthropogene; 
Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
There is frustration and reward when an article appears on the same topic of an article you are completing – in this case the Holocene. Such was the case this week with Andy May’s article “A Review of temperature reconstructions.” Andy points out the basic problems of reconstruction using proxy data for the most recent half of the Holocene – an issue central to historical climate and climate change studies. His paper did not alter my paper except as it reinforces some arguments.
This article examines the entire Holocene and illustrates the history that influenced the studies. There are two distinct parts to the studies, the pre and post Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The former is a genuine scientific struggle with issues of terminology and reconstruction, and the latter a scientific struggle to impose a political perspective regardless of the evidence. Because of the damage done to climatology by the proponents of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), both parts require explanation.
The title of this article lists all the names given to a single geologic period. It reflects the problem of inconsistent terminology in the early days of historic climate reconstruction. The names were a result of regional studies reflecting the lack of coordination in a pre-global village world. They were attempts to improve and advance scientific knowledge and understanding, but only created confusion because of failure to agree on the start and end points and duration of the period. The concept of relative homogeneity is critical to determine if a climatic change was regional, hemispheric or global. You cannot achieve accurate analysis if the sequence of events is unknown or incorrect – a point noted in May’s article.
Even a cursory examination of the Holocene shows why the period is problematic for promoters of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). As Steve McIntyre pointed out, the problems began when skeptics noted that the temperature for most of the Holocene contradicted their claim that the latter part of the 20th century was the warmest ever. I know they never used the term ‘ever’, rather, it was left unsaid but implied in the message to the public and not contradicted when used by the media.
McIntyre wrote;
The Team has taken a preditable (sic) position on the Holocene Optimum: that it’s a regional and restricted event.
It was predictable because it was the same argument they used for the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Prove an event was regional, and you essentially eliminate the Sun as a mechanism of change – an issue central to the AGW CO2 argument. The restriction included the claim that only summer temperatures were warmer. Even if true, it is not possible to say based on proxy records with 40 to 70-year smoothing averages applied. Interestingly, the IPCC clung to this “Team” view as recently as AR4 (2007).
The temperature evolution over the Holocene has been established for many different regions, often with centennial-resolution proxy records more sensitive to specific seasons.
Of course, this was before Climategate and the leaked emails that destroyed the Team’s credibility.
The problem of terminology impacted global reconstruction when attempts were made to synchronize glacial/interglacial events in Europe and North America. European glacial events were labelled in 1909 by Albrecht Penck (1858-1945) and Eduard Bruckner (1862-1927) from the oldest to the most recent, the Gunz, Mindel, Riss, and Wurm. In North America, led by the work of Thomas Chamberlin (1843-1928) and Frank Leverett (1859-1943) the sequence was the Nebraskan, Kansan, Illinoian, and Wisconsin. This helped define what happened within the Pleistocene but didn’t help in defining the end and beginning of the following period or synchronicity.
The term Holocene means most recent and was first suggested by Geologist Charles Lyell whose work influenced Darwin. He anticipated the modern environmental activists because he suggested it marked the human era. The problem is human history covers a few million years, and there is no evidence the Pleistocene is ended. Although Lyell’s claim was unjustified, the idea continues today as some call the Holocene The Age of Man. Regardless, there is no doubt we are in an interglacial but is it just that, and attempts to define shorter periods only part of the political game of blaming humans for all change.
The game continues with the proposal to name the most recent portion of the Holocene the Anthropocene. The definition underscores the politicization of science. However, it requires reassessment because what occurred during the period contradicts the claims for the Anthropocene defined as.
“Relating to or denoting the current geological age, viewed as the period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment.” 
This is false if we accept the IPCC conclusion, the human influence on climate is discernible only after 1950.

Correlating Events
 
Another book I consider significant in the attempts to match the various records was Climate, Man, and History by Robert Claiborne published in 1970. It spoke to the contradictory dates used in different disciplines. He wanted to write a doctoral thesis on the conflicting dates and incompatibility of events used by glaciologists and anthropologists, but the idea was rejected. As a result, he quit university, the supposed bastion of innovative thought, and wrote the book. He referred to the closed mind of academia in the first sentence.
“This book will probably annoy quite a number of scientists.”
Naturally, it was immediately attacked because it questioned the prevailing wisdom and worse, crossed the boundary between science and arts. The following comment illustrates the confused reaction by obliquely acknowledging the problem but then equally obliquely questioning Claiborne.
Claiborne’s caveat in the preface to this thoroughgoing study of climate and culture is that he’s going to venture some opinions of his own, attack others’, and, in general, try to dispel the fog that has enveloped many scientific studies of man in nature. He does this somewhat modestly at the beginning, coping with the complex, often conflicting theories on the causes, conditions, and timing of the last ice ages, and then increasingly with a more idiosyncratic style and sharper tongue.
There are parallels between Claiborne’s experiences and the claims made about the weather, climate, and history today. The official story of weather and climate promulgated by governments through the IPCC and environmentalists’ state that current weather and climate are anomalous and exhibiting more extreme conditions than ever before. The message is amplified and further distorted by a complicit and duplicitous media. Recently, a UK Daily Mail headline read,
“Sizzling UK records hottest day ever.”
The story did not qualify the word “ever” by saying it was the record within the modern span of thermometer measurements. The headline is what stays with the uninformed. Put the claim in the larger perspective of the Holocene and a completely different picture emerges about the official claims. They are creating the Anthropocene to isolate it from the Holocene because it gives the lie to the entire anthropogenic global warming deception. Judith Curry provided an interesting discussion about the lack of evidence for the Anthropocene, especially its mythical threat to humanity.
Weather and climate conditions through the Anthropocene are normal; that is, they are well within the range of all previous weather and climate variations. Despite official and media claims to the contrary, there are no dramatic increases in temperature, precipitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, or any other severe weather. The climate is changing just as it always has and always will, and the rate of change is perfectly normal. Of course, that is not what the government, environmentalists, or the media promote and as a result most of the public believe. The misconception is deliberate and central to the exploitation of global warming and climate change as the vehicle for a political agenda.
What The Public Need To Know
The following is not new to skeptics but identifies issues the public need to know to understand the AGW deception. Figure 1 shows one reconstruction of the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere derived from Greenland ice cores. It provides a brief context to show the wider natural range of temperature over the last 10,000 years. It shows the meaningless identification of the Anthropocene identified by the small red bar.

Figure 1
The accuracy of the climate record is critical for determining underlying mechanisms. It is critical if you want to identify specific periods but is still difficult because of determining points of starting and ending. Figure 1 appears to show a clear start of the Holocene with a dramatic warming around 10,500 years ago, but many place the onset at 11,700 years ago. Figure 2 shows why it is not clear cut. Is the Younger Dryas part of the Holocene? Is the extent of a geologic period determined by the major causative mechanism or some arbitrary temperature threshold? Search for an explanation of the Younger Dryas generated many speculative papers. There is an entire journal The Holocene devoted to the period.

Figure 2
The Younger Dryas is the focus of intense research, but also great speculation about the causative mechanism.
Other important points from Figures 1, 2 and 3 expose the lies and distortions about the last 120 years being anomalous include,

Current temperatures are proclaimed as the warmest on record. In fact, the world was warmer than today for 97 percent of the last 10,000 years.
The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) just 1000 years ago was 2°C warmer than today. The public is told that a similar warming will be catastrophic.
The Minoan warm period approximately 3500 years ago was 4°C warmer than today.
We are told the amount and rate of temperature increase in the last 100 years is abnormal. Compare the slope with any of the previous increases in Figure 2.

 

Figure 3.
· Figure 3 shows the CO2 trend over the Holocene. CO2 rose as temperature declined over the last 8000 years.
The Holocene is also problematic for AGW proponents because the major causative mechanism appears to be the changing precession, one of the Milankovitch Effect (ME) trilogy along with orbital eccentricity and axial tilt. A recent article at WUWT cites from Bender’s book Paleoclimate
“The orientation of Earth’s spin axis has changed over the past 10 Kyr so that northern summers now occur when Earth is farthest from the sun, whereas at 10 Ka [10,000 BP] they occurred when Earth was closest to the sun. Northern summertime insolation reached a maximum at about 10 Ka and has declined to the present, when it is near the minimum.”
The IPCC AR4 Physical Science Basis FAQ section provides the only reference to the ME. This includes the remarkable observation that
These examples illustrate that different climate changes in the past had different causes. The fact that natural factors caused climate changes in the past does not mean that the current climate change is natural.
True, but it was the same IPCC report that said natural changes became insignificant after 1950. They ‘proved’ this by eliminating most natural changes from their reports and their computer models. The IPCC is only comfortable discussing ME on time scales greater than the Holocene. AR5 says,
There is high confidence that orbital forcing is the primary external driver of glacial cycles (Kawamura et al,. 2007; Cheng et al., 2009; Lisiecki, 2010; Huybers, 2011). 
But they couldn’t leave that comment unqualified, so they added,
However, atmospheric CO2 content plays an important internal feedback role. 
There is no reference to the ME in the AR5 FAQ section or the Glossary of AR4 or AR5. This supports the information that it is not included in the IPCC computer models. The justification for exclusion is the time scale, but even in the 120 years of the Anthropocene, the impact is at least marginally significant relative to CO2 changes. The bigger problem is the inability to validate the models by recreating previous conditions without including the ME.
The Holocene is an interesting warm period that many believe marks the end of the last ice advance of the Pleistocene. It fascinated early scientific attempts to understand the events and mechanisms in the early days of climate reconstructions, which were complicated by a lack of standardized terminologies and central collections of data. For example, I recall long discussions about the need for centralized data banks on tree rings. The Holocene became ignored or distorted after the advent of AGW and the IPCC because the evidence of its existence contradicted most of their claims.

"■ White House press secretary Sean Spicer stood by President Trump’s false assertion that millions of illegal voters gave Hillary Clinton her popular vote win. ■ Gag orders seem to be proliferating throughout the federal bureaucracy, but the national parks are taking to Twitter to speak up. ■ A new national security political action committee, assembled by former intelligence officers and national security officials, has begun posting “no spin” research on the president’s business interests abroad. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that President Trump has long believed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 election, furthering a false claim from the podium of the West Wing briefing room and refusing to rule out an investigation down the road. “He said 3 to 5 million people could have voted illegally, based on the studies that he’s seen,” Mr. Spicer told stunned reporters, acknowledging a statement that Mr. Trump made privately in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday afternoon. Mr. Trump and his aides repeatedly suggested during the transition period that “irregularities” contributed to his   loss by nearly 3 million ballots to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump won the Electoral College, but his    popular vote loss to Mrs. Clinton was the largest for a winning presidential candidate since the disputed election of 1876. Democrats and some Republicans have pointed to that margin to claim that Mr. Trump is an illegitimate president. Such assertions have rankled Mr. Trump deeply. A November 2016 blog post on Infowars, the conspiracy   website run by radio host Alex Jones, posited the idea that roughly 3 million people voted illegally. Mr. Jones has hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in the past. The assertion was based on tweets from a   voter expert, who claimed to have a study. However, there’s no evidence of the study. And officials in swing states where Mr. Trump secured victory, many of which are governed by Republicans, say that there is no evidence of such fraud. Mr. Spicer also made vague reference to another Pew Research Center study that supposedly backed up Mr. Trump, but the author of the study in question, David Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, tweeted again that no such fraud happened. When a reporter pointed out to Mr. Spicer that such widespread fraud would be one of the biggest scandals in American electoral history and asked why the administration isn’t investigating, the press secretary said, “Maybe we will. ” Mr. Spicer, who worked at the Republican National Committee before working for Mr. Trump, declined to say whether he personally believes this claim. “What does it mean for democracy?” a reporter asked about Mr. Trump’s belief. “It means that I’ve answered your question,” Mr. Spicer said. With reports proliferating about executive branch agencies under gag orders, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the White House is “looking into it,” though he didn’t exactly deny it. “I don’t think it’s any surprise that when there’s an administration turnover, that we’re going to review the policies,” he said. It started when the National Park Service retweeted crowd shots this weekend attesting to a smaller audience for President Trump’s inauguration than for Barack Obama’s first in 2009. That prompted a blackout, then an apology, then lots of pretty pictures. “They had inappropriately violated their own social media policies,” Mr. Spicer said. “There was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth. ” Well, looks like Badlands National Park has gone rogue. But it looks like    out there. Poor man wanna be rich. Rich man wanna be king. And a king ain’t satisfied, Till he rules everything. “Badlands,” Bruce Springsteen Daring Mr. Trump to make good on his grand infrastructure promises, Senate Democrats on Tuesday will unveil a   plan to rebuild the nation’s roads, railways, airports, waterways and sewer systems over 10 years. “From our largest cities to our smallest towns, communities across the country are struggling to meet the challenges of aging infrastructure,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will say. “Our urban and rural communities have their own unique set of infrastructure priorities, and this proposal would provide funding to address those needed upgrades that go beyond the traditional road and bridge repair. ” Republicans resisted President Barack Obama’s push for an infrastructure “surge” for eight years, arguing that the federal government couldn’t afford it and that state and local governments should shoulder more responsibility for improvements. But Mr. Trump has taken up the Democratic cause. “We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation,” he vowed in his Inaugural Address. The plan dedicates $180 billion to rail and bus systems, $65 billion to ports, airports and waterways, $110 billion for water and sewer systems, $100 billion for energy infrastructure, and $20 billion for public and tribal lands. “We’re asking President Trump to work with us to make it a reality,” Mr. Schumer will say. Next up from the Trump White House news fire hose: a nominee for the Supreme Court. President Trump has invited Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, as well as both the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to the White House at 3 p. m. Tuesday to discuss the nearly   vacancy on the Supreme Court. The president said a nomination would be announced next week. “We will pick a totally great Supreme Court justice,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the end of an event where he signed executive actions. Mr. McConnell, on the Senate floor Tuesday, said, “I appreciate the president soliciting our advice on this important matter. ” Mr. McConnell blocked consideration of any nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February, during the final year of President Obama’s term. Former intelligence officers and national security officials have formed a new national security political action committee, called 4DPac (Democracy Development Diplomacy Defense) to publish what they call   research on Mr. Trump’s foreign investments. Their concern: that the president’s business dealings could clash with the nation’s national security interests. Their first targets: India and Turkey, with many more to come. White House aides have been trying to nudge the president to ditch his personal Twitter account and use the official @POTUS handle. After all, presidential communications are supposed to be archived and preserved under specific rules. Think Hillary Clinton’s private server, not something Mr. Trump appeared to approve of during the campaign. It’s not working. He started the day with: He continued with: (That one has the peculiarity of misstating the date of Mr. Trump’s inauguration.) And he has kept going. #MAGA! House and Senate Republicans decamp from Washington on Thursday for their annual retreat  —   this time in Philadelphia. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made it official: President Trump will be the guest of honor. Despite a rocky start to their relationship, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the head of the Office of Government Ethics, is apparently still “willing and ready” to help Mr. Trump handle his potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Shaub met with members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a   session on Monday afternoon at the request of the chairman of the panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. After Mr. Shaub publicly criticized Mr. Trump’s plans this month, Mr. Chaffetz accused him of playing politics  —   prompting Democrats and other watchdogs to come to the ethics monitor’s defense. According to a recap of Monday’s meeting by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, Mr. Shaub said that his office had not received copies of documents that Mr. Trump referenced at a news conference on Jan. 11, and that it had been provided with no new information. Still, Mr. Shaub said he would help the president, if called upon. There were about nine members of the committee at the meeting  —   eight Democrats and Mr. Chaffetz, according to his spokeswoman, M. J. Henshaw. After Mr. Chaffetz left the meeting with Mr. Shaub, he told reporters: “I think we understand each other better. ” Big Labor may have been With Her, but the unions that represent builders and pavers Love Him. “We have a common bond with the president,” said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, after meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump and hearing him promise a major push to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. “We come from the same industry. He understands the value of driving development, moving people to the middle class. ” If the labor movement divides over Mr. Trump, it would not be the first time. An old saying holds that the building trades would pave over their mothers’ graves if it created jobs. And before Mr. Trump’s rise, unions like the Communications Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union had split with the building unions over the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, with the former siding with liberal environmentalists and the latter seeing opportunities for work. In this case, the unions may unite with Democrats behind the new president  —   leaving Republican spending hawks in the cold. On his first working day as the country’s new secretary of defense, James N. Mattis spoke with the head of NATO and told him that the United States depends on it and on Europe for   security. The telephone conversation came just a week after Mr. Mattis’s boss, Mr. Trump, called NATO “obsolete,” because, Mr. Trump said, the alliance hasn’t done enough to combat terrorism. Mr. Mattis “wanted to place the call on his first full day in office to reinforce the importance he places on the alliance,” a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, said in a statement on Monday night."

We were told that refrigerant gases and CFCs and spray cans and stuff were all terribly bad because they caused a huge hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic.



So all the non-patented gases were banned and we all had to change to newly invented and patented (more expensive) gases to save those of us in the southern hemisphere from skin cancer.



Well, guess what? Decades after the last of those nasty gases was released in the wild, the biggest hole in the ozone layer has just been measured above the Arctic.



Surely we weren’t spun a line based on insufficient evidence were we? Would someone do that to us? The fact that measurement of the size of the ozone hole over Antarctica was relatively new and there was no historical data to base anything on surely must have weighed heavily on the expensive changes society had to make to solve this particular climate crisis?



A vast ozone hole — likely the biggest on record in the north — has opened in the skies above the Arctic. It rivals the better-known Antarctic ozone hole that forms in the southern hemisphere each year.



Record-low ozone levels currently stretch across much of the central Arctic, covering an area about three times the size of Greenland (see ‘Arctic opening’). The hole doesn’t threaten people’s health, and will probably break apart in the coming weeks. But it is an extraordinary atmospheric phenomenon that will go down in the record books.



“From my point of view, this is the first time you can speak about a real ozone hole in the Arctic,” says Martin Dameris, an atmospheric scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen. […]



The Antarctic ozone hole forms every year because winter temperatures in the area routinely plummet, allowing the high-altitude clouds to form. These conditions are much rarer in the Arctic, which has more variable temperatures and isn’t usually primed for ozone depletion, says Jens-Uwe Grooß, an atmospheric scientist at the Juelich Research Centre in Germany.



But this year, powerful westerly winds flowed around the North Pole and trapped cold air within a ‘polar vortex’. **There was more cold air above the Arctic than in any winter recorded since 1979,** says Markus Rex, an atmospheric scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam, Germany. In the chilly temperatures, the high-altitude clouds formed, and the ozone-destroying reactions began.



Say that again. “There was more cold air above the Arctic than in any winter recorded since 1979.” Ummmmm – Global warming, anyone?



Oh no, it really was the nasty chemicals, though:



Things **would have been much worse this year** if nations had not come together in 1987 to pass the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phases out the use of ozone-depleting chemicals, says Paul Newman, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. **The Antarctic ozone hole is now on its way to recovery — last year’s hole was the smallest on record** — but it will take decades for the chemicals to completely disappear from the atmosphere.



These people cannot help themselves. “Smallest on record”? No. 16.4 million square kilometres was the smallest since 1982 according to NASA. This from a NASA page titled **“2019 Ozone Hole is the Smallest on Record”**



Abnormal weather patterns in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica dramatically limited ozone depletion in September and October 2019, **resulting in the smallest ozone hole since 1982** , NASA and NOAA scientists reported.



What do [the numbers say](http://www.theozonehole.com/ozoneholehistory.htm)?



If it was all due to the diminishing effects of CFCs et al, would there not be a downward trend since the Montreal Protocol came into force? I’m not seeing it myself.



Surely our revered climate scientists would not be being economical with the truth?

Guest essay by Andy May
In previous posts (here and here), I’ve compared historical events to the Alley and Kobashi

GISP2 Central Greenland Temperature reconstructions for the past 4,000 years. Unfortunately, these two reconstructions are very different. Recently Steve McIntyre has suggested a third reconstruction by Bo Vinther. Vinther’s data can be found here. Unfortunately, Vinther is often significantly different from the other two. The Alley data has been smoothed, but the details of the smoothing algorithm are unknown. So the other datasets have been smoothed so they visually have the same resolution as the Alley dataset. Both datasets (Kobashi and Vinther) were first smoothed with a 100 year moving average filter. Then 20 year averages of the smoothed data were taken from the one year Kobashi dataset to match the Vinther 20 year samples. The Alley data is irregularly sampled, but I manually averaged 20 year averages where the data existed. If a gap greater than 20 years was found that sample was skipped (given a null value).
All three reconstructions are shown in Figure 1. There is no reason to prefer one of the three reconstructions over the other two, so I simply averaged them. The average is the blue line. I’m not presenting this average as a new or better reconstruction, it is merely a vehicle for comparing the three reconstructions to one another and to other temperature reconstructions. This is an attempt to display the variability in common temperature reconstructions for the past 2,000 to 4,000 years.

Figure 1
There are some notable outliers apparent in the comparison. In particular, we see the odd 700AD Kobashi spike, the scatter in the interval from 700BC to 100BC, and the Minoan Warm Period is completely missing in the Vinther reconstruction. The estimates agree better from 900 AD to the present than they do prior to 900 AD. Perhaps as the ice gets older accuracy and repeatability are lost. Figure 2 shows the same average and the maximum and minimum value for each 20 year sample.

Figure 2
The average temperature for the 4,000 year period is -30.8°C. The average minimum and maximum suggest this value is plus or minus 0.3°C. Perhaps we are simply seeing the error in these methods and nothing more. For those who want to see the messy details of the average temperature calculation the spreadsheet can be downloaded here. As noted in my previous post, the error in the time axis is probably at least +-50 years. Loehle has suggested a time error of +-100 years based on 14C laboratory errors. These give us some perspective in interpreting the reconstructions. Below is a comparison of the average to the same historical events we have used before.

Figure 3, click on the image to download a high resolution pdf
This average temperature reconstruction shows a steady decline in temperature since the Minoan Warm Period, interrupted by +-120 year cycles of warm and cold. Don’t take the apparent 120 year cyclicity too seriously all of the data was smoothed with a 100 year moving average filter. After the end of the coldest period, the Little Ice Age, the Modern Warm Period begins and temperatures rise to those seen in the Roman Warm Period. The Modern Warm Period is equivalent to the Medieval Warm Period within the margin of error. We need to be careful because we are comparing actual measurements to averaged proxies. When proxies are averaged all high and low temperatures are dampened. In particular, the Medieval Warm Period is somewhat smeared and dampened due to the Vinther record. The Vinther Medieval Warm Period peak is earlier than the Kobashi and Alley peaks. Major volcanic eruptions fit this timeline reasonably well. Rabaul is noted at 540AD. Others are Thera-Santorini in 1600 BC and Tambora in 1815. TheHadCRUT 4.4 point shown with a red star is an average of several HADCRUT4 surface temperature grid points in the Greenland area thought to be comparable to the Greenland average temperature.
Comparisons to broader temperature reconstructions
Dr. Craig Loehle published a global composite temperature reconstruction in 2007 and a corrected version of the reconstruction in 2008. This reconstruction has been widely reviewed and appears to have stood the test of time. Subsequent work seems to support the reconstruction. In Figure 4 we show his global reconstruction compared to the Greenland average and the recent reconstruction of temperature in the extratropical (90° to 30°N) northern hemisphere by Ljungqvist. The graph in Figure 4 shows temperatures as anomalies since each line represents a different area.

Figure 4
All of the reconstructions show a trend of decreasing temperature to the Little Ice Age, roughly from 1400 to 1880 AD. They also show a temperature peak around 1000 AD. The most striking thing about Figure 4 is that the temperature swings seen in the Greenland Average are larger than in the broader reconstructions. Is this because they average more proxies? Or because temperature changes are amplified in the Arctic and Antarctic as suggested by Flannery, et al? Probably a combination of both. Finally Figure 5 shows the Greenland average compared to two Arctic reconstructions. One is the ice core component of the Arctic reconstruction by Kaufman, 2009 (data here) and the other is the Sunqvist, 2014 “PAGES2K” arctic reconstruction (data can be found here). In Figure 5, the Arctic and PAGES2K temperature anomalies have been shifted to the average central Greenland temperature for the period for comparison purposes.

Figure 5
These two multi-proxy Arctic reconstructions agree fairly well with the Greenland average if we assume a +-0.3°C temperature error and +-50 year time error. It is interesting that the peak about 400AD is seen in the Arctic and Greenland reconstructions but not in the global reconstructions plotted in Figure 4. The Sunqvist, 2014 reconstruction was used as presented in his paper, it seemed to be carefully constructed. Sunqvist,et al. did include some tree ring data (fewer than 1% of the proxies), but they used it carefully and his reconstruction was not dominated by tree ring data.
Kaufman’s Arctic reconstruction used a lot of tree ring data (4 of 23 proxy records) as can be seen in his Figure 3 and in his dataset. Tree ring data does provide an accurate chronology, but it provides a poor temperature proxy due primarily to what has been called the “divergence” problem. Tree rings may correlate well to temperatures in a “training” period, but show little correlation to temperature longer term. This is probably because forests adapt to long term climatic changes by adjusting tree density and tree size. Tree ring widths can reflect summer temperatures, precipitation and many other factors, but extracting the average air temperature from them is problematic. Loehle discusses this problem and other problems with tree ring data here and here. For this reason, only the ice core records (seven proxy records of 23) from Kaufman’s reconstruction were used to plot the “Arctic” line in Figure 5. Figure 6 compares Kaufman’s “All proxies” reconstruction to his ice core, sediment (and lake varves) and tree ring proxies. The ice core, sediment and tree ring proxies only agree reasonably well for the last 500 years, before that the tree ring proxies diverge dramatically downwards. The lake and marine sediment proxies (12 of the 23) are lower than the ice core proxies also, but not so dramatically. We all know of another paleoclimatologist who took advantage of this divergence.

Figure 6
When all of the proxies are used the earlier temperatures are much lower and the modern warm period has a higher peak. The recent peak in the graph is the twenty year average around 1945. The proxy reconstruction then drops, the last point is centered on 1985. I didn’t bother to “hide the decline.” Except for the sharp drop from 1945 to 1985 Kaufman’s ice core proxies fit the rest of the reconstructions shown here reasonably well.
Discussion
There are many Greenland area temperature reconstructions, they use ice core data, lake and marine sediment core data and other proxies, mainly tree rings. They are not perfect and contain errors in the temperature estimates and errors on the time scale. The exact error is unknown, but by comparing reconstructions we can see that they generally, except for the tree ring proxies, agree to within 0.3°C and in time to within 50 years or so. Why is this important? Natural climate cycles are poorly understood. Some like the ENSO cycle (La Nina and El Nino) we can identify, but because they are irregular and the cause is unknown we cannot model them. The same is true of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These events affect the weather and climate all over the world, but they are not accurately included in the GCM’s (General Circulation Models) used by the IPCC and other organizations to compute man’s influence on climate. Thus, some portion of the Modern Warm Period attributed to man may, in fact, be attributable to these or other natural climate cycles.
During the 1980’s and 1990’s the PDO was mostly positive (warming). From the mid 1990’s to today the AMO has been mostly positive and undoubtedly contributing to warming. There have been numerous attempts to see a pattern in these multidecadal natural climate cycles. Most notably, Wyatt and Curry identified a low-frequency natural climate signal that they call a “stadium wave.” This model is based on a statistical analysis of observed events (especially the AMO) and not on the physical origins of these long term climate cycles. But, it does allow predictions to be made and the veracity and accuracy of the stadium wave hypothesis can and will be tested in the future.
Another recent paper by Craig Loehle discusses how the AMO signal can be removed from recent warming, leaving a residual warming trend that may be related to carbon dioxide. He notes that when the AMO pattern is removed from the Hadley Center HADCRUT4 surface temperature data the oscillations are dampened and a more linear increase in temperature is seen. This trend compares better to the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allows the computation of the effect of carbon dioxide on temperature. The calculation results in an increase of 0.83°C per century. This is roughly half of the observed increase of 1.63°C. Loehle suggests that the AMO may be the best indicator of natural trends. If this is true then half of recent warming is natural and half is man-made. It also suggests that the equilibrium climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide is about 1.5°C per doubling of CO2. This is the lower end of the range suggested by the IPCC. This value also compares well to other recent research.
Conclusions
The use of temperature proxies to determine surface air temperatures prior to the instrument era is very important. This is the only way to determine natural long term climate cycles. Currently, in the instrument record, we can see shorter cycles like the PDO, AMO, and ENSO. When these are incorporated into models we see that half or more of recent warming is likely natural, belying the IPCC idea that “most” of recent warming is man-made. Yet, these shorter cycles are clearly not the only cycles. When we look at longer temperature reconstructions we see 100,000 year glacial periods interrupted by brief 20,000 year interglacial periods. These longer periods will probably only be fully understood with more accurate reconstructions. Intermediate ~1500 year cycles, called “Bond events” have also been identified.
Tree ring proxies older than 500 years and younger than 100 years are anomalous. This anomaly is large enough to cast doubt on any temperature reconstruction that uses tree rings. Between lake and marine sediment proxies and ice core proxies it is harder to tell which is more likely to be closer to the truth. They agree well enough to be within expected error. All of the proxies diverge from the mean with age, none appear to be very accurate (or more precisely in good agreement) prior to 1100 AD. It does appear that all of the proxies except the tree ring proxies, could be used for analytical work back to 1100 AD; this is encouraging.
The other very important use for temperature reconstructions is to study the impact of climate changes on man and the Earth at large. Historical events are often known to the day and hour, only when we have reconstructions with more accurate time scales can we properly match them to major events in history. In addition, this work made it clear that combining multiple proxies causes severe dampening of the temperature response because the time scale error causes peaks and valleys in the average record to be reduced. Multiple proxy reconstructions show less temperature variation than actually occurred. Ideally, we need a very accurate time scale on all proxies so they can be combined properly. But, achieving more accuracy than 50-100 years will be difficult given current dating technology. Tree rings are more accurate than this, but they are a poor indicator of temperature. There is a lot of work needed in this area.

"**US lawmakers have approved new Hong Kong-related sanctions, after Beijing imposed a security law that has been widely condemned across the world.**
The US measure, which penalises banks which do business with Chinese officials, was passed unanimously by both the House and the Senate.
It has been sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law.
Critics say China's law ends freedoms guaranteed for 50 years after British rule ended in Hong Kong in 1997.
""The law is a brutal, sweeping crackdown against the people of Hong Kong, intended to destroy the freedoms they were promised,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the passing of the law was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration.
Under this declaration, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, with certain freedoms guaranteed for at least 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.
The UK has offered residency, and then citizenship, to up to three million Hong Kongers.
But on Thursday China threatened ""corresponding measures"" to block the citizenship plan.
""If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges, as well as international law and basic norms,"" said the Chinese Embassy in the UK.
Meanwhile, a 24-year-old man from Hong Kong - suspected of stabbing a police officer during Wednesday's protests - has been arrested on a plane while trying to flee to London.
The suspect, known only as Mr Wong, was detained on the plane moments before it set off.
China said the security law was necessary to stop the type of protests seen in Hong Kong during much of 2019.
And despite widespread international condemnation from leading powers, more than 50 countries, led by Cuba, supported China at the UN this week.
The Hong Kong Autonomy Act imposes sanctions on banks that do business with Chinese officials who are involved in cracking down on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
Ms Pelosi said the law was an ""urgently needed response to [China's passing] of its so-called 'national security' law... which is purpose built to dismantle democratic freedoms in Hong Kong"".
Before the bill was signed, the US had already begun eliminating Hong Kong's special status - halting defence exports and restricting the territory's access to high-technology products.
Last year, the US also signed into law the Human Rights and Democracy Act, supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
The UK said it would offer up to three million Hong Kong residents the chance to settle there and ultimately apply for full British citizenship.
Australia is also ""actively considering"" offering safe haven to Hong Kong residents - with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying there were proposals that will ""soon be considered by cabinet"".
Meanwhile a senior Taiwanese official said its citizens should now avoid unnecessary transits through or visits to Hong Kong.
Chiu Chui-Cheng, deputy head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said the new security law was ""the most outrageous in history"". Taiwan's de facto consulate in Hong Kong would continue to operate, he said.
Japan was among the other countries that spoke out against the law, calling it ""regrettable"".
""It will undermine trust for the principle of 'one country, two systems',"" said Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.
European Council President Charles Michel said it ""deplored"" the law, which he said had a ""detrimental effect on the independence of the judiciary and rule of law"".
And Canada changed its travel advice to Hong Kong, saying the new law ""increased the risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China"".
Yesterday, a senior Chinese official hit back at foreign critics, saying Hong Kong's affairs were ""none of your business"".
No. At the United Nations this week, Cuba - on behalf of 53 countries - welcomed the law.
Speaking at the 44th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, it said: ""Non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign states is an essential principle enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
""We believe every country has the right to safeguard its national security through legislation, and commend relevant steps taken for this purpose.""
Just hours after the law was passed, Hong Kong police made their first arrests.
Ten people were accused of violating the new law, including a man with a pro-independence flag. About 360 others were detained at a banned rally.
Under the new law, inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government are offences.
Acts including damaging public transport facilities - which often happened during the 2019 protests - can be considered terrorism."
"ATLANTA  —   At least 18 people were killed and 43 more injured in Georgia and Mississippi after thunderstorms and tornadoes roared through the South this weekend, leaving some things standing and some things fallen, some lives whole and others blown to bits. Charles McDowell, pastor of Barney United Methodist Church in Barney, Ga. was safe at home in nearby Valdosta on Sunday. So was the modest church where he preaches to his flock of a few dozen. But many of his members were suffering  —   their homes damaged, including roofs torn away, and their electricity off. There was little for him to do but try to reach out to them on their cellphones. “As a church,” Mr. McDowell said, “we’re praying for each other. ” Catherine Howden, a spokeswoman for Georgia’s emergency management agency, said 14 people had died and 23 had been injured in central and southern parts of the state. She said there had been up to 20 reports of tornadoes. Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Sunday for seven counties: Atkinson, Berrien, Brooks, Colquitt, Cook, Lowndes and Thomas. “The state is making all resources available to the impacted areas,” Mr. Deal said in a statement. He added that he was prepared to expand or extend the emergency declaration, and that he was likely to seek federal help. On Sunday afternoon, during a ceremony to swear in senior White House staff members, President Trump said he had spoken with Mr. Deal, and noted that Florida and Alabama had also been hit. Mr. Trump said he had expressed to Mr. Deal “our sincere condolences for the lives taken” and promised to help Georgia. He added that he planned to reach out to Florida’s governor, Rick Scott. George Wetzel, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Peachtree City, Ga. said that in the past three days, a strong   system had moved east across the South, which had been unseasonably warm, with moisture moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. A statement from Mississippi’s emergency agency said a tornado had caused extensive damage in the southern part of the state early Saturday, killing at least four people in or near Hattiesburg and injuring more than 20 others. Gov. Phil Bryant called for a state of emergency as power lines and debris littered roads. In Georgia, an intense round of thunderstorms that started Saturday morning produced a number of tornadoes, and a second round overnight produced flooding rains, including more than six inches in 24 hours just east of Albany. A third wave of storms began in some parts of the state early Sunday. On Sunday morning in Adel, Ga. Jeff Lane, a county commissioner, surveyed the wreckage at the Sunshine Acres trailer park, where he said all of the county’s deaths had occurred. (He said eight had died, but Ms. Howden said later that the toll was actually seven.) Search and rescue crews were still making their way through the community. Photographs showed an open field surrounded by thin trees, strewn with splintered wood, metal sheeting and destroyed cars. “It’s like a bomb had been dropped out here at ground level,” Mr. Lane said by phone. “You’ve got   frames that look like spaghetti noodles. We’ve tried to evacuate as many as we can. But it’s raining real hard, and we’re getting ready to start another round of storms. ” Mr. McDowell, the pastor in Barney, a small community known for its peaches, said he had canceled Sunday services because of power failures and the continuing storms. “A lot of my people have physical damage,” he said. “Some of the roofs are ripped off, trees are down, and of course the power is off now. ” The weather also caused damage in Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, but it was not clear Sunday whether anyone had been killed or injured in those states. NOAA warned of a “high risk” of severe weather in Georgia and parts of Alabama and Florida. Since Saturday morning, 30 tornadoes were reported in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi, the agency said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA shorter post today, as this afternoon I’ve got to prepare 50 lbs. of chili con carne (and let me tell you, I can taste it already).
German meteorological and climate site Schneefan (snow fan) here writes on the recent changes by the DMI on its Greenland ice mass chart. Personally I wouldn’t be surprised if this were in part due to climate data embarrassment.
Schneefan writes that the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) recently changed the reference period for showing the Greenland ice mass: from the warmer 1990-2013 to the internationally usual but colder WMO climate period of 1981-2010.
The change over to the WMO-recommended older and colder reference period has the effect of making the massive ice growth of the past two years with respect to the new mean look smaller, as the current comparison shows (lower chart).

Top: The total daily contribution to the surface mass balance from the entire ice sheet (blue line, Gt/day). Bottom: The accumulated surface mass balance from September 1st to now (blue line, Gt) and the season 2011-12 (red) which had very high summer melt in Greenland. For comparison, the mean curve from the period 1981-2010 is shown (dark grey). The same calendar day in each of the 30 years (in the period 1981-2010) will have its own value. These differences from year to year are illustrated by the light grey band. For each calendar day, however, the lowest and highest values of the 30 years have been left out.“ Source: http://www.dmi.dk/surface-mass-budget/.

By changing the comparison period in April 2017 from 1990-2013 to the older and colder WMO 1981-2010 climate period, the mean shown by the gray line and shaded area is raised. This is illustrated by the thin black lines I’ve added to the two lower charts showing the old mean peak value.  Using the 1990-2013 period, the mean peak value was about 550 gigatonnes.
Today using the older and colder WMO 1981-2010 the mean yearly peak rises to about 600 gigatonnes. As a result the current curve shown in blue the strong ice growth during September 2016 becomes less apparent. Moreover, the strong 2015/16 ice year year has been left out (brown curve in the old chart, left).
Foremost by leaving out the strong 2012 melt year (red curve in lower chart), which acted to significantly pull down the 1990-2013 ice mass, and by extending the chart out nine years into the colder past (from 1990 to 1981) the new 1981-1990 mean is considerably higher than the old one: Honi soit qui mal y pense… 
Finally, it’s good to remind readers that despite the powerful El Niño, RSS stellite data show no warming in close to 20 years.

"The oceans cover almost three-quarters of the planet’s surface, and for many people they represent the last great wilderness. But in fact the seas support many human activities, and have done for millennia - for how much longer, though, is debatable. And that has raised many suggestions of how to save them. Marine ecosystems underpin an estimated two-thirds of global GDP, and seafood makes up around 6% of the world’s total protein consumption. As the world’s population approaches nine billion by the middle of this century, the demands on the sea to provide nutrition will continue to rise. Yet the UN has already acknowledged the failure to ensure sustainable use of the seas - efforts to ensure stocks are fished sustainably have been underway for more than 100 years in Europe, yet most stocks are over-exploited with population numbers below safe biological limits. As well as over-fishing, human activities impact upon the whole marine ecosystem. The food chain is affected as predator or prey species are removed in great numbers, causing population shifts and imbalances. The seas are used as a dumping ground, from household rubbish to toxic waste. The oceans have also absorbed around half of all the carbon dioxide emitted since the industrial revolution, which has raised the oceans’ acidity levels. This build up of toxins, warming and acidification all impose great stresses on sea life. So it’s clear that existing management schemes are failing to protect the oceans. This has prompted some to call for a partial privatisation of the oceans, with coastal communities “owning” areas of the sea. A recent proponent is the World Bank. Its 21-person panel of experts concludes that the threats to the ocean are so diverse and difficult for traditional measures to regulate that large-scale public-private partnerships are the best hope of delivering sustainable use. The idea that someone who has ownership of a resource will protect it seems intuitive and proposals to “privatise” fisheries have a long history. Private rights do not themselves deliver sustainability or environmental protection – look at the impact industrialisation of agriculture has had on the countryside, for example. It is legislation that protects woods, hedgerows and field margins, not the fact that someone owns them. From an economic point of view, creating a market – attributing value to, buying and selling areas of the sea - would contribute to economic indicators such GDP as these “services” currently rendered gratis would now be captured in the trading accounts of companies. But ultimately it would take something that is the common property of all and sell it (one assumes governments would sell rather than give) to corporations and consortia. These would then trade the sea floor like any other property. From an ecological point of view the proposal is flawed. The seawater that carries fish larvae, plankton and other foods, and pollutants too, will wash in and out of these regions without any regard for boundary lines drawn on maps and charts. Similarly, fish will swim in and out of the areas without checking in at border control. These cross-boundary movements would render many of the possible protective measures ineffective. When we own land we generally erect a fence or wall to keep our livestock in and to prevent others from gaining access to or damaging or our property. The land ownership analogy is simply not appropriate in the context of the oceanic world. The UN Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) follows the principle that the high seas are international and owned by no nation, and are the common heritage of mankind (Article 136). A policy of privatisation of the seas therefore involves setting aside this principle. Human pressures on the ocean continue to increase and effective action is certainly needed, and urgently. The idea of ceding parts of the ocean to local communities, perhaps in partnership with multinational corporations, is seen as providing a mechanism that would allow the communities that have a stake in the health of their local ecosystems to play a part in managing them, using their local knowledge. Anthropologists are keen to promote examples where indigenous people develop their own environmental and resource management practice using traditional ecological knowledge. There are many examples of such successes in the marine environment - particularly in dynamic, productive ecosystems - but where fish are highly mobile such approaches fail. If your fish move in and out of your patch it will always pay to catch them now, rather than let them go to be caught by someone else, or risk them moving to another area and not returning. The “noble savage” living in balance with nature is simply a [romantic Victorian construct](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5411.full](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/10/5411.full). Archaelological evidence shows clear over exploitation of fisheries resources by Stone Age peoples. The world’s fish catch peaked in the 1980s; even from the 1960s on it was clear many stocks were severely over exploited. In the 50 years since then we have seen proposal after proposal to save the seas – reduce pollution, introduce Marine Protected Areas, extend Exclusive Economic Zones to 200 miles, and others. None has really delivered. Speaking as an ecologist, the answer is simple – we need to reduce fishing. We need to do this urgently, make a significant change, and in one or two decades we might have healthier stocks which can then sustain catch rates similar to now. But talk of privatising the sea is just another example of how politicians are unwilling to face the challenge head on."

In 1918, the city of Philadelphia threw a parade that killed thousands of people. Ignoring warnings of influenza among soldiers preparing for World War I, the march to support the war effort drew 200,000 people who crammed together to watch the procession. Three days later, every bed in Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals was filled with sick and dying patients, infected by the [Spanish flu](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/).



By the end of the week, more than [4,500 were dead in an outbreak](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) that would claim as many as 100 million people worldwide. By the time Philadelphia’s politicians closed down the city, it was too late.



A different story played out in St. Louis, just 900 miles away. Within two days of detecting its first cases among civilians, the city closed schools, playgrounds, libraries, courtrooms, and even churches. Work shifts were staggered and streetcar ridership was strictly limited. Public gatherings of more than 20 people were banned.



The extreme measures—now known as social distancing, which is being called for by [global](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) [health agencies](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus—kept per capita flu-related deaths in St. Louis to [less than half](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/health/17flu.html) of those in Philadelphia, according to [a 2007 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7582).



The concept of “flattening the curve” is now [a textbook public health response](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html) to epidemics, including the [spread of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html). Once a virus can no longer be contained, the goal is to slow its spread. Exponential growth in infections leaves health care systems [struggling to handle the surge](https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-italy-doctors-tough-calls-survival/). But with fewer people sick at once (and overall), services aren’t overwhelmed and deaths diminish. This buys time for doctors to treat the flood of patients and researchers to develop vaccines and anti-viral therapies.



But it wasn’t always this way, says Richard Hatchett, a physician and head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in London, who co-authored the 2007 paper. Social distancing interventions were not always trusted, he wrote in an email; they were widely ignored during flu pandemics in 1957 and 1968. But in the 2000s, several papers including Hatchett’s reanalyzed Spanish flu data to show the efficacy of distancing measures—and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later incorporated them into their outbreak guidance.



But in the 2000s, several papers including Hatchett’s reanalyzed Spanish flu data to show the efficacy of distancing measures—and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later incorporated them into their outbreak guidance.



 **The key to effective social distancing, though, is timing.**



“I think the critical lesson from both the modelling and the historical work is that the benefits of multiple interventions are greatest if they are **introduced early** (before 1% of the population is infected) and maintained,” wrote Hatchett, who has also directed medical preparedness in the Obama White House. Distancing measures are less effective once more people have contracted the virus, especially in cases where the vast majority of people are not sick enough to need medical attention.



This outbreak is one of those cases. Only 19% of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, become severely or critically ill, [reports the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html). Those with mild symptoms (or none at all) may easily pass the virus on to [vulnerable people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#who-is-higher-risk), particularly those who are older or have pre-existing health conditions. “You can compare the outcomes in [Hong Kong,](https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/local_situation_covid19_en.pdf) [Singapore](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19), and [Taiwan,](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/10/21171722/taiwan-coronavirus-china-social-distancing-quarantine) which used such interventions aggressively from the very start, with what happened in [Wuhan](https://qz.com/1807166/wuhan-reverses-announcement-of-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown/) and what is happening now in [Iran](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/irans-coronavirus-problem-lot-worse-it-seems/607663/) and [Italy](https://qz.com/1814502/northern-italy-shuts-down-to-contain-the-coronavirus/),” Hatchett wrote. “There is no reason to expect the virus to behave differently in Europe and the U.S. than it has in Asia.”



China and Italy may have waited too long; both were forced to take drastic steps weeks after the first cases were discovered. China’s government locked down nearly 60 million people in Hubei province while restricting travel for hundreds of millions of others. Now Italy is [banning public gatherings and imposing travel restrictions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51810673) for 60 million residents, a [first for a modern democracy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-extends-coronavirus-lockdown-to-entire-country-imposing-restrictions-on-60-million-people/2020/03/09/baa10058-6248-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html).



In the U.S., these restrictions are just beginning. New York state has [closed large gathering spaces](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html) and deployed National Guard to disinfect buildings and deliver food in a “containment zone” in New Rochelle, just north of New York City.



But social distancing doesn’t have to be draconian. South Korea has adopted a modern version of the St. Louis model; the country never locked down its residents or quarantined entire cities, but has still managed to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. In recent days, new infections have [levelled off](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea/lower-trend-in-new-coronavirus-cases-raises-glimmer-of-hope-in-south-korea-idUSKBN20X04P), thanks in part to thousands of free daily tests and a [coordinated government effort](https://abcnews.go.com/International/south-koreas-drastic-measures-coronavirus-offers-glimpse-us/story?id=69383034) that closed schools, cancelled public events and supported flexible working arrangements. “Without harming the principle of a transparent and open society,” South Korea’s Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip [told journalists](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3074469/coronavirus-south-korea-cuts-infection-rate-without) in the South China Morning Post, “we recommend a response system that blends voluntary public participation with creative applications of advanced technology.”

"NAIROBI, Kenya  —   Tens of thousands of civilians dead, countless children on the verge of starvation, millions of dollars stolen by officials, oil wells blown up, food aid hijacked and as many as 70 percent of women sheltering in camps raped  —   mostly by the nation’s soldiers and police officers. Just a few years ago, South Sudan accomplished what seemed impossible: independence. Of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in Africa, the South Sudanese actually won. Global powers, including the United States, rallied to their side, helping to create the world’s newest country in 2011, a supposed solution to decades of conflict and suffering. Now, with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war, a radical question has emerged: Should South Sudan lose its independence? As international frustrations and worries grow, some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over South Sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down. Several academics and prominent opposition figures support the idea, citing East Timor, Kosovo and Bosnia as places where, they say, it has worked, though of course there are plenty of cautionary tales where outside intervention failed, like Somalia and Iraq. The Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani recently floated a plan in which the African Union would take the lead in setting up a transitional government for South Sudan. Ideally, Mr. Mamdani said, none of the current South Sudanese politicians who have helped drag their nation into civil war would be able to participate, and the trusteeship would last around six years, requiring United Nations support. “The response to the crisis will need to be as extraordinary as the crisis,” he said. But there is one    problem. Many South Sudanese might not go for it. According to James Solomon Padiet, a lecturer at Juba University, most members of the nation’s largest ethnic group  —   the Dinka, who include South Sudan’s embattled president, Salva Kiir  —   are adamantly set against an international takeover. While smaller ethnic groups would welcome it, he said, the powerful Dinka see it as an affront to their sovereignty. For that matter, so does Mr. Padiet, a   scholar who is not a Dinka. He called trusteeship “offensive” because South Sudan has a potential crop of good leaders waiting in the wings who haven’t had a chance to rule. Still, Mr. Padiet conceded, the country desperately needs help. “As we speak now,” he said, “South Sudan is at crossroads of disintegration or total fragility. ” Clashes have spread to new areas of the country, and   militias are mobilizing in the bush. It’s all a staggering plunge from the country’s birth. I, along with hundreds of other journalists, was standing in a crowd that felt like a million people on July 9, 2011, the insanely hot day when South Sudan broke off from Sudan. The sense of pride, sacrifice, hope and jubilation will be hard to forget. For decades, South Sudanese rebels had battled the     central government of Sudan. They fought in malarial swamps and on sweltering savannas, incredibly hostile environments where it’s hard to survive, let alone wage a guerrilla war on a shoestring. The South Sudanese had absorbed bombings and massacres. The Arabs stole their children and turned them into slaves. As a result, many South Sudanese were scattered across the four corners of the earth  —   the famous Lost Boys, but also many Lost Girls, ripped from their families and forced to flee to cold foreign places that they had never envisioned. On independence day, South Sudan’s capital, Juba, partied until dawn. Lost Boys swigged White Bull (the local beer) next to hardened guerrillas bobbing their heads to reggae rap. All around us, there seemed to be a real appreciation of what had been achieved and what lay ahead. Most important, there was unity. That crumbled quickly, undermined by old political rivalries, ethnic tension and a greed for South Sudan’s one main export: oil. The fault line was the most predictable one, the Dinka versus the Nuer. The two biggest ethnic groups had alternated between allies and enemies throughout South Sudan’s liberation wars. Starting in December 2013, after a breakdown between their political leaders, who not so long ago had been hailed as heroes, Nuer and Dinka militias began killing each other and civilians across the country, especially in ethnically mixed areas. Women were raped. Children were burned to death. Some people were even forced at gunpoint to eat the flesh of their dead relatives. The horror has been meticulously documented. Still, it goes on. For years, the United Nations has stationed thousands of peacekeepers in the country, but often they have not intervened. In 2012, shortly after independence, I rushed to a remote town, Pibor, where hundreds had just been massacred by an ethnic militia. I saw one woman who was literally holding her arm together  —   she had been blasted by a Kalashnikov  —   as she sat in a medical tent that smelled of decaying flesh. She stared at the wall, not making a murmur. I interviewed peacekeepers who told me how they had watched civilians get shot right in front of them, yet the peacekeepers felt too scared to raise their rifles. United Nations officials in Juba have been excoriated for failing to spring into action and effectively step between Mr. Kiir and Riek Machar, the former vice president and the most influential Nuer, as their rivalry intensified and grew into nationwide bloodshed. This is a big reason some people think an international trusteeship will never work. “Having completely failed in the international   project, now we’re going to move to an international takeover? With what army?” asked John Prendergast, who has been working on South Sudan for 30 years and   the Enough Project, an   group. “Would the same international bureaucrats that undertook massive   experiments in Iraq and Afghanistan come to Juba to lead another failed political intervention?” he added. “It all seems fantastical, doomed and extremely unlikely. ” Other scholars take a middle view. Amir Idris, chairman of Fordham’s African and   studies department and a frequent writer on South Sudan, said an international trusteeship should be considered  —   but only as a last resort. He says the most important issue is that a new government be built with new people, including academics and technocrats. “South Sudan has no chance of transitioning itself to a functioning state unless the edifice of the current leadership is brought down,” he said. Bronwyn Bruton, the deputy director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, called South Sudan’s leaders “such a disaster. ” She said Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar were “corrupt,” “ ” and “willing to stoke ethnic conflict and commit horrible violence in pursuit of power. ” “Genocide is beginning to look inevitable,” she said. “The situation could hardly be more hopeless. ” But she worries that no country has the appetite to spearhead a meaningful intervention. The Obama administration considered several ways to help usher in a political transition, a former administration official said, but eventually concluded it was not feasible. It’s not as if Mr. Kiir or Mr. Machar or their inner circles, who are widely believed to continue to profit from oil and conflict, are going to volunteer to step aside. Thousands of armed men are intensely loyal to them, and even a few friends left in Western capitals make the case that the South Sudanese government has stabilized Juba in recent months, has become more inclusive and should be allowed to stay. One glimmer of hope comes from across the continent. In the last few days, troops from several West African countries banded together to eject Gambia’s president, who tried to stay in power illegally. If such resolve was demonstrated in this part of Africa, then maybe, the interventionists argue, South Sudan’s leaders could be pushed aside and the country would be allowed to breathe."
"**A shop owner in Hong Kong is refusing an order to remove a life-sized statue of a female anti-government protester from one of his stores.**
Herbert Chow has been told by landlords at a location of one of his Chickeeduck children's clothing shops that the figure must be taken down.
But the ""Lady Liberty"" statue has been popular with shoppers amid an informal boycott of pro-Chinese businesses.
Hong Kong has witnessed months of unrest and mass protests.
Demonstrations in the former British territory began last year in response to an extradition law planned by Beijing, but the unrest soon morphed into a larger vehicle for anti-China and pro-democracy sentiment.
The Chickeeduck store's white statue was installed on Tuesday and shows a demonstrator wearing a helmet, gas mask and goggles. In one hand she carries an umbrella - a symbol of mass protests in 2014 - and in the other a flag that reads: ""Free Hong Kong, revolution now.""
In a letter verified by Reuters news agency, the mall's managing company said a clause in the contract specified that any unlicensed ""exhibition"" could break both the law and the tenancy agreement.
The shop's 56-year-old owner, however, has said he ""will not remove it"".
""The revolution that we need now is the persistent fight for... the freedom of speech, press, expression and creativity, and not to have to put up with anything that you think is unjust,"" Mr Chow told Reuters.
He is due to meet the mall's owners on Friday to discuss an extension to his lease, which ends this month.
Activists and protesters in Hong Kong have been supporting so-called ""yellow"" businesses, which have supported the pro-democracy movement.
Although protests in Hong Kong began a year ago, tensions have surfaced again in recent weeks over a highly controversial national security bill.
Many fear the proposal could mean an end to much of the territory's autonomy, which it has enjoyed under an agreement signed when Hong Kong was returned to China from British control in 1997.
Although the creation of a national security law formed part of the agreement, a lack of popularity has meant that it has never been implemented."
"**The US Treasury has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top officials from Hong Kong and mainland China.**
The sanctions were used to target those undermining Hong Kong's autonomy, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
""The United States stands with the people of Hong Kong,"" Mr Mnuchin added.
The move comes weeks after China imposed a controversial national security law on Hong Kong, which critics say threatens its freedoms.
US-China tensions continue to escalate. Earlier this week, the Trump administration moved to ban US transactions with the Chinese owners of the WeChat and TikTok apps.
Among those sanctioned are Hong Kong's police commissioner and several political secretaries.
The US Treasury directly accused Ms Lam of ""implementing Beijing's policies of suppression of freedom and democratic processes"".
""In 2019, Lam pushed for an update to Hong Kong's extradition arrangements to allow for extradition to the mainland, setting off a series of massive opposition demonstrations in Hong Kong,"" the US Treasury added in a statement.
On Saturday, the Hong Kong government branded the move ""blatant and barbaric interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, using Hong Kong as a pawn"".
Ms Lam's spokesman said she would not be ""intimidated"".
""Speaking on behalf of her senior colleagues who are being targeted, the Chief Executive Mrs Carrie Lam said that we are discharging an honourable duty to safeguard national security, protecting the life and interests of not only the 7.5 million Hong Kong people but also the 1.4 billion Mainlanders.""
Luo Huining, Beijing's representative in Hong Kong, is among those sanctioned. He said the measures were ridiculous.
Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau called the sanctions disproportionate and warned of retaliation against US businesses in the region.
The 11 sanctioned officials will have all property in the US seized and financial assets frozen.
The US has strongly criticised Hong Kong's national security law, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling it an ""Orwellian move"" and an assault ""on the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong"".
China has defended its controversial law as necessary to stop foreign interference in Hong Kong and the often violent pro-democracy protests that took place last year.
Announcing the sanctions on Friday, Mr Pompeo said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has made clear that Hong Kong will never again enjoy the high degree of autonomy that Beijing itself promised to the Hong Kong people and the United Kingdom for 50 years.
""President Trump has made clear that the United States will therefore treat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system' and take action against individuals who have crushed the Hong Kong people's freedoms.""
Ms Lam has previously scoffed at the suggestion of sanctions, saying last month: ""I do not have any assets in theÂ United StatesÂ nor do I long for moving to theÂ United States.""
The latest sanctions were authorised by an executive order Mr Trump signed in July aimed at punished China for its role in Hong Kong's affairs.
Tensions between the US and China have risen at an accelerated pace in recent months.
The White House has accused China of lying about the origins of the coronavirus, which emerged from China late last year; of using social media apps to spy on Americans; of ""stealing"" intellectual property; and of hiding a wanted criminal within a Chinese embassy in the US - to name only a few allegations.
Both countries ordered each other's consulates in major cities to close last month as tensions rose.
The US has also pressured partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance- Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK - to ban China's Huawei 5G telecoms systems, citing national security concerns.
China has expelled journalists from major US newspapers after the US placed new restrictions on Chinese media outlets that are affiliated with the country's communist government.
Earlier this month China issued arrest warrants for six pro-democracy activists, including an American citizen.
China's push into the South China Sea has also alarmed its neighbours as well as the US, which has increased the pace navy patrols sent into the sea to counter Chinese expansion.
**Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News Chinese, Washington**
The US sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials had been looming for weeks.
The actual personal impact on these Hong Kong-based officials may be limited if they have no financial interests in the US and no plans to travel there.
And Carrie Lam herself said recently that she is not afraid of the sanctions.
But this move is highly symbolic, as it's Washington's latest step condemning Beijing's drive to curtail freedoms and democracy in Hong Kong. The former British colony has become a major point of contention between the US and China.
The world's two largest economies seem to be going through a painful ""divorce,"" with a consequential US presidential election only three months away.
What does Washington get out of this? By being tough on Beijing the Trump administration is trying to rally voters, while the China hawks in the White House are aiming to correct the course of a bilateral relationship from which they believe China has gained more than America."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday we look at two new papers that reveal renewable energies don’t deliver what their proponents like to have us believe they do, i.e. clean, affordable and reliable energy, and another telling us that the Paris Agreement is a joke.
Biofuel blends are more polluting
The first paper by Emery et al., 2017, looks at biofuel and found:
Life-cycle non-GHG air pollutant emissions, particularly NOX [nitrous oxides] and PM [particulates], are higher for corn ethanol and other biofuel blends than conventional petroleum fuels.”
Other findings include 1) emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) increase by 9–50% per 100 km traveled for high-ethanol blends from corn grain and combined grain and stover feedstocks; 2) NOX, PM [particulates], and SOX [sulfur dioxides] increase by 71–124% from corn grain and 56–110% from combined grain and stover, relative to conventional gasoline; and 3) The total social costs of ethanol blends are higher than that of gasoline, due in part to higher life-cycle emissions of non-GHG pollutants and higher health and mortality costs per unit.
In Germany many people are apprehensive about putting fuels blended with ethanol or biodiesel into their tanks because it is long known that these fuels are more aggressive with the vehicles’ fuel burning systems. I never put the stuff in my car.
Renewables cannot compete
Another paper shows that renewable energies are non-competitive on yet another front. Vass, 2017 here concludes that they “cannot compete with forest carbon sequestration to cost-efficiently meet the EU carbon target for 2050″.
The paper writes:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




[T]he average cost per unit emissions reduction is more than twice as high for renewables as for forest carbon sequestration. Hence, the results indicate that renewables are unable to compete with forest carbon sequestration unless they receive continued government support.”
Paris Agreement is a “toothless deal”
And finally another study by Mahapatra and Ratha, 2017 finds that the Paris Agreement “is a relatively toothless one, which does not bind countries to actual emission limits, and has no mechanisms to impose actions. No sanctions will fall on any country that fails to come up to these intentions.”
The paper goes on to quote Professor James Hansen, the so-called father of climate change awareness:
…the deal is worthless words’ (Wente, 2015).  The final text contains only bland platitudes. There is no necessary connection between the legally binding nature of an international agreement and its effectiveness in producing outcomes (Lake, 2015). The agreement delineates an aim for reducing temperatures to a 2°C above pre-industrial levels, but does not commit.
Yes, this is what all the climate activists and politicians were celebrating in December, 2015, in trying to have us believe they had accomplished something really big and unprecedented.
And there have been rumors that Ivanka Trump is pushing for the deal’s ratification by the US. Don’t be surprised should President Trump sign it. But it won’t matter, because the treaty is toothless and only a show. On the other hand, the President should keep his campaign promise and not sign the farce treaty.

"Environmentalists at Friends of the Earth will mount a legal challenge against the government’s decision to offer $1bn in financial support to a major fossil fuel project in Mozambique that they say is “incompatible” with the Paris climate agreement. The green group will go to the high court this week to seek a judicial review into the government’s decision to use taxpayer money to “worsen the climate emergency” by helping to finance a $20bn gas project on the Mozambican coast.  Friends of the Earth said the government’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance, offered its largest single financial support package without undertaking a transparent assessment of the project’s environmental and social risks, which is a legal requirement. UKEF has granted loan guarantees and direct funding to British companies bidding for work on fossil fuel projects worth more than £3.5bn since the UK signed up to the Paris climate agreement. The Mozambique support package was announced just over a year after MPs on the environmental audit committee called for an end to government support for polluting projects overseas, saying it “undermines the UK’s climate commitments”. Will Rundle, legal head at Friends of the Earth, said: “It concerns us greatly that our taxpayer money is being used to worsen the climate emergency in this way, and the Department for International Trade appears to have pushed this decision through without adequate transparency or environmental due diligence, in line with their policies and legal requirements. “The climate hypocrisy of this government is astounding. On the one hand, it claims to be a climate leader, and on the other, we are providing $1bn in financial support to new gas mega-project that will sabotage all our efforts to stop climate breakdown.” Rundle said the government had “refused to disclose any meaningful information” on its assessment of the project’s environmental impact, and appeared to “hide from public scrutiny of the consequences of its own actions”. A spokeswoman for UKEF told the Guardian that the agency has conducted a review of the project – including environmental, social and human rights impacts – which considered its impact on the climate. She declined to make the review public. Rowan Smith, a lawyer for the green group at law firm Leigh Day, said the government had “a clear obligation” to disclose the impact of the project on the environment. “Friends of the Earth considers that the government has breached its own policy, and in making the investment has failed to properly consider the Paris Agreement, which requires the UK to drastically and quickly divest from fossil fuel infrastructure,” he said. He added that the group would argue that the investment also breaches “a number of other international law standards on the environment and human rights, in violation of government commitments”. UKEF has claimed that its involvement in the Mozambique LNG project will support over 2,000 UK jobs, including small businesses across the country, and could prove “transformational for Mozambique’s economic and social development”. Environmentalists argue that the east African nation should be encouraged to invest more heavily in renewable energy to build a sustainable green economy."

Washington Governor Jay Inslee is throwing his hat in the ring for President of the United States. The central focus of his campaign for 2020 will likely be climate change. In an echo of the Green New Deal’s grand vision, Inslee says in a new video that he wants “100 percent clean energy, that will bring millions of good paying jobs to every community across America, and create a more just future for everyone.”   
  
  
However, Inslee has been remarkably unsuccessful in convincing residents of his own state to go along with his tax‐​and‐​spending plans for climate change. He has not been able to get a carbon tax passed through the state legislature and carbon tax plans have failed twice on statewide ballots.   
  
  
In 2016, Washington voters rejected a carbon tax (Initiative 732) by a solid (59–41) margin. In 2018, Washington voters rejected another carbon tax (Initiative 1631) by another solid (56–44) margin.   
  
  
Governor Inslee was assigned an “F” on the 2018 Cato Fiscal Report Card. He was the worst‐​scoring governor on the report. His appetite for tax and spending increases has been insatiable since he entered office in January 2013.   
  
  
From the Governor’s Report:   




Inslee has pushed relentlessly for tax increases. He originally campaigned on a promise not to raise taxes, but he proposed more than $1 billion in higher taxes in his first budget in 2013. In 2014, he proposed a new tax on capital gains and increases in cigarette taxes and other taxes. In 2015, he approved a gas tax increase as well as higher taxes on businesses. In 2016, he proposed broadening the bases of various taxes to raise funding for education.   
  
  
In his budget for the 2017–2019 biennium, Inslee proposed increasing the state’s business and occupation tax rate to raise more than $1.1 billion a year, creating a new capital gains tax of 7.9 percent to raise more than $800 million a year, and creating a carbon tax to raise more than $900 million a year. Most of his proposed tax hikes did not make it through the legislature, but Inslee did sign into law an increase in the state property tax and online sales tax to raise $1.5 billion annually. He also vetoed legislation to reduce the business and occupation tax rate.   
  
  
Inslee has continued to advocate for a carbon tax even though the idea has been rejected by both the state legislature and Washington’s voters. In November 2016, voters rejected a carbon tax (Initiative 732) by a solid 59–41 margin. But in the wake of that defeat, Inslee has continued to push for such a tax; his latest plan is designed to raise at least $750 million in its first year and growing amounts after that. So far, the plan has failed to pass the legislature.   
  
  
Carbon‐​tax supporters keep trying, and they have put another scheme on the ballot for November 2018. Voters will decide on Initiative 1631 whether to impose a new tax on carbon emissions to raise about $800 million a year by 2027. The tax would be collected from various industries, although the plan exempts certain politically favored industries.   
  
  
Inslee also scores poorly on spending. The current biennial general fund budget is up 17 percent over the prior budget. State government employment has risen more than 7 percent since Inslee took office.

"More than 1 billion people face being displaced within 30 years as the climate crisis and rapid population growth drive an increase in migration with “huge impacts” for both the developing and developed worlds, according to an analysis. The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), a thinktank that produces annual global terrorism and peace indexes, said 1.2 billion people lived in 31 countries that are not sufficiently resilient to withstand ecological threats.  Nineteen countries facing the highest number of threats, including water and food shortages and greater exposure to natural disasters, are also among the the world’s 40 least peaceful countries, the IEP’s first ecological threat register found. Many of the countries most at risk from ecological threats, including Nigeria, Angola, Burkina Faso and Uganda, are also predicted to experience significant population increases, the report noted, further driving mass displacements. “This will have huge social and political impacts, not just in the developing world, but also in the developed, as mass displacement will lead to larger refugee flows to the most developed countries,” Steve Killelea, the institute’s founder, said. “Ecological threats pose serious challenges to global peace. Over the next 30 years, lack of access to food and water will only increase without urgent global cooperation. In the absence of action, civil unrest, riots and conflict will most likely increase.” The study uses United Nations and other data to assess 157 countries’ exposure to eight ecological threats, then assesses their capacity to withstand them. It found that 141 countries faced at least one ecological threat by 2050, with sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa the regions facing the largest number. Some countries, such as India and China, are most threatened by water scarcity, it concluded, while others such as Pakistan, Iran, Kenya, Mozambique and Madagascar face a combination of threats and a growing incapacity to deal with them. “Lack of resilience will lead to worsening food insecurity and competition over resources, increasing civil unrest and mass displacement,” the report said. It judged Pakistan to be the country with the largest number of people at risk of mass migration, followed by Ethiopia and Iran, adding that in such countries “even small ecological threats and natural disasters could result in mass population displacement”. Wealthier, more developed regions in Europe and North America face fewer ecological threats and would be better able to cope with them, but most “will not be immune from wider impacts”. The report said 16 countries, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, and Iceland, faced no threat. The report said that the world had 60% less fresh water available than it did 50 years ago, while demand for food was predicted to rise by 50% by 2050 and natural disasters were only likely to increase in frequency because of the climate crisis, meaning even some stable states would become vulnerable by 2050."

History is littered with the smoking ruins of the unintended consequences of official decisions.



In the wake of the _Titanic_ disaster, new laws were passed, mandating that all ships over 100 tons had to carry enough lifeboats for every passenger. The only problem was that not all ships were designed to do so safely: 800 people drowned when the _Eastland_ capsized under the extra load of all its new lifeboats.



More recently, conservations undertook to eradicate cats from remote Macquarie island, to protect its native birds. The campaign successfully rid the island of cats – whereupon rabbits bred uncontrollably, [triggering an “ecological meltdown”](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/13/macquarie-cats-conservation). The Australian government has had to spend over ten years and $100m fixing the damage caused by good intentions.



The panicked mass evacuations from everywhere near Fukushima caused far more suffering and death than the nuclear accident itself.



Now, experts are warning that, for all its good intentions, the panicked response by governments around the world to control the Chinese virus may trigger even worse consequences.



Veteran scholar of epidemiology **Dr. Knut Wittkowski** , formerly the head of the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at Rockefeller University in New York City, argued in a interview published earlier this month that shelter-in-place policies could actually result in more deaths in the long term.



In the absence of a vaccine, the idea of “eradicating” the virus is fanciful, at best. The only hope for such a strategy would be for countries like Australia and New Zealand to completely isolate themselves and ruthlessly quarantine their populations.



Focusing on shielding the most vulnerable to the virus (our elderly and folks with comorbidities) while allowing the young and healthy to build up immunity would, in the end, save more lives, Wittkowski argued.



“With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity…so, it’s very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated,” he continued.



More importantly, allowing herd immunity to build up in the general population now would forestall the kind of dreaded “second wave” already manifesting in China.



“If we are preventing herd immunity from developing, it is almost guaranteed that we have a second wave as soon as either we stop the social distancing or the climate changes with winter coming or something like that,” added Wittkowski.



Unfortunately, politicians with a natural bent for authoritarianism are only listening to advice that they already want to hear – and applying only those prescriptions which gel with their own preferences.



 **When politicians like Jacinda Ardern aver that they are “listening to the experts”, the truth is that they are only listening to _some_ of the experts.** Because expert opinion is divided and not all “experts” have the same expertise.



Ardern is certainly not listening to experts like Wittkowski, nor **Dr. David L. Katz**.



Dr. David L. Katz, president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, writing at The New York Times on March 20, suggested our “fight” against COVID-19 could be worse than the virus itself[…]



[“W]e could achieve the crucial goals of social distancing — saving lives and not overwhelming our medical system — by preferentially protecting the medically frail and those over age 60, and in particular those over 70 and 80, from exposure,” Dr. Katz explained.



“I am deeply concerned that the social, economic and public health consequences of this near total meltdown of normal life — schools and businesses closed, gatherings banned — will be long lasting and calamitous, possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself,” he added.



 **Professor John Ioannidis** of Stanford University School of Medicine is also warning that limited testing is leading to selection bias and dramatically overstating the threat from the virus. Other [Stanford medical professors ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464)agree.



“The woefully inadequate data we have so far, the meta-research specialist argues, indicates that the extreme measures taken by many countries are likely way out of line and may result in ultimately unnecessary and catastrophic consequences.”



To use an analogy, you could burn your house down and point to the charred nest and proclaim that you have successfully eradicated your termite problem. Which would be true. **But that’s not the only way to eradicate termites, and you’ve undeniably created worse problems than you already had.**

"The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider, according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer. The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations, researchers reported. What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and   monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable. “This shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,” said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. “We have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with the”  —   expected  —   “repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening. ” The racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed. In the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10. 1 per 100, 000. For white women, it is 4. 7 per 100, 000. Previous studies had put those figures at 5. 7 and 3. 2. The new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4, 000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a   of existing numbers, in an adjusted context. Typically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer. “We don’t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn’t include women who don’t have a cervix,” said Anne F. Rositch, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “If we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women we’re targeting. ” Although the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue   test results, and insurance coverage. A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15, 194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor. According to the analysis published Monday, the   mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in   Africa. Certainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white. In years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers. In recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years. The guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade. The current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older. But experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many   stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a    woman who had met guidelines’ requirements would subsequently develop the disease. But given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides? Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment. “When we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,” he said. “The quality of assessment and   treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?” Although this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures. Studies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny’s patients have often never had Pap smears. She recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. “One was 39,” Dr. Kemeny said, “and the other was 25. ”"
"The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has accused Extinction Rebellion of seeking “to limit the public’s access to news” after the group blockaded two UK printworks, delaying the distribution of major national newspapers. The activists, who staged the action to highlight the failure by the media to “report on the climate and ecological emergency”, were also condemned by the home secretary, Priti Patel, for “attacking democracy”. More than 100 protesters used vehicles and bamboo structures to block roads outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, on Friday evening. Hertfordshire police said delivery lorries had not left the Broxbourne site as of 6am on Saturday, and that 42 arrests had been made. The presses print the Murdoch-owned News Corp’s titles, including the Sun, Times, Sun on Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, and the London Evening Standard. A spokeswoman for Newsprinters said printing had transferred to “industry partners” overnight and that staff were working to get newspapers delivered to retailers as soon as possible. “We apologise sincerely to any readers of the Sun, the Times, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times who may be unable to buy their usual newspaper this morning due to late deliveries,” she said. “This attack on all of the free press impacted many workers going about their jobs. Overnight print workers, delivery drivers, wholesale workers and retail newsagents have faced delays and financial penalty. This is a matter for the police and the Home Office.” The Federation of Independent Retailers said the protest left small businesses with “angry customers” to deal with as well as affecting home delivery services. Stuart Reddish, the body’s national president, said: “Many members have reported that their newspaper deliverers have been left hanging around as their deliveries have failed to arrive. It also means we are unable to get newspapers to our elderly and vulnerable customers. “Newsagents have played a critical role during Covid-19 in getting newspapers into the hands of readers and this is not helpful at a time when every sale counts.” Industry sources told the Guardian that other newspaper publishers swiftly helped pick up capacity to limit the disruption to distribution. The Daily Mirror parent company Reach, Dundee’s DC Thomson, regional paper group JPIMedia, and the Daily Mail owner DMGT all provided capacity at their print plants to get as many copies of Murdoch-owned papers out to shops as possible. Newsagents were provided with a letter apologising for the disruption and calling it an attack on the free press. Regional distribution was patchy. Many shops received piles of weekend supplements for the Times and the Daily Telegraph, which are printed in advance, but not copies of the main newspaper. A small number of Guardian home-delivery subscribers were affected. A Guardian News & Media spokesperson said: “Our home-delivery service is provided by Newsprinters, a subsidiary of News UK, so a small proportion of our print subscribers who get the Guardian delivered directly to their homes faced some delays in receiving the paper this morning, and will not have received supplements.” They added: “We fully support the right to protest – but we do not condone any action that restricts the public’s right to access journalism and buy whichever newspaper they choose.” Local newspapers printed at the Broxbourne site were also affected, with East Anglian titles produced by the publisher Archant missing from shelves on Saturday. Johnson wrote on Twitter: “A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change. “It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public’s access to news in this way. Patel also responded to the protest in a tweet, saying: “This morning people across the country will be prevented from reading their newspaper because of the actions of Extinction Rebellion. “This attack on our free press, society and democracy is completely unacceptable.” Under a banner reading “Free the truth”, XR tweeted that it was using the disruption to expose the newspapers’ “failure to report on the climate and ecological emergency, and their consistent manipulation of truth to suit their own agendas”. We’re here all night, folks! We’re going to to filter out the lies and take the power back for a night.FREE THE TRUTH#ExtinctionRebellion #freethetruth #ClimateEmergency #WeWantToLive pic.twitter.com/mUhFvp0tc5 Alanna Byrne, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We will only tackle the climate and ecological emergency by breaking the traditional impasse of oppositional politics and coming together, despite our differences. “If we are to sort out this mess we’re in, the mainstream media must stop profiting from clickbait culture that is swimming in misinformation, that makes us hate our neighbours, suspect foreigners and vulnerable groups, and rally the nation into action.” Gully Bujak, an XR activist, said: “The climate emergency is an existential threat to humanity. Instead of publishing this on the front page every day as it deserves, much of our media ignores the issue and some actively sow the seeds of climate denial.” Hertfordshire police said officers were called to Great Eastern Road near the Broxbourne plant at about 10pm, where they found about 100 protesters who had “secured themselves to structures and one another”. Hertfordshire police assistant chief constable, Owen Weatherill, said: “The rights to protest are well established in this country and we remain committed to facilitating peaceful protest and ensuring compliance. However, at this time, the group are not engaging with us and the protest is causing major disruption to local businesses.” XR protesters also held a smaller demonstration near Motherwell aimed at disrupting the distribution of Saturday’s Scottish Sun newspaper. The Society of Editors executive director, Ian Murray, called the Extinction Rebellion protest “foolish and anti-democratic”. “The irony of protesters who wish to have their voices heard and their message listened to attempting to silence others by preventing the distribution of newspapers would be laughable if it was not so serious,” he said. “You have to wonder whether those planning and taking part in these foolish actions understand anything from history; that controlling or shutting down free speech and an independent media is the first action of totalitarian regimes and dictators.” A News Corp source defended the company’s stance on climate, saying that Saturday’s Sun carried an opinion piece by David Attenborough on how to tackle the climate crisis. The company was also moving to scrap all single-use plastic used to wrap its titles. Dear @RoyalFamily the government is failing us. Please be a Dancing Queen and help us save the planet pic.twitter.com/DzWrPxDZ8d On Saturday, the climate activists gathered in Trafalgar Square for a “Citizens Assemble!” event to listen to speeches about the climate emergency. Attendees were asked to move on by police officers moving through the crowds. Outside Buckingham Palace, other members of the climate group staged a “discobedience” – a two-hour danceathon to encourage the royal family to intervene on climate issues."
"The anxiety began well before the Cleveland convention, where the candidate of the “Forgotten Men,” the one who declared Americans “the greatest Race on the face of this old Earth,” seemed likely to clinch his party’s presidential nomination. Doremus Jessup, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel “It Can’t Happen Here,” sees something dark and terrible brewing in American politics  —   the potential for “a real fascist dictatorship” led by the    populist candidate Berzelius Windrip. Friends scoff at this extravagant concern. “That couldn’t happen here in America, not possibly!” they assure him. But Jessup, a   Vermont newspaper editor and a “mild, rather indolent and somewhat sentimental liberal,” worries about the devastation ahead. “What can I do?” he agonizes night after night. “Oh  —   write another editorial    I suppose!” When Election Day comes to pass, Jessup learns that his editorials have not done the trick. The reality of the new situation feels unspeakably awful, “like the   passing of a friend. ” Jessup faces the presidential inauguration in a state of high distress, convinced that the nation is careering toward its doom, but that nobody  —   least of all his fellow liberals  —   can do much to stop it. “It Can’t Happen Here” is a work of dystopian fantasy, one man’s effort in the 1930s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America. At the time, the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler, whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States. Today, Lewis’s novel is making a comeback as an analogy for the Age of Trump. Within a week of the 2016 election, the book was reportedly sold out on Amazon. com. At a moment when instability seems to be the only constant in American politics, “It Can’t Happen Here” offers an alluring (if terrifying) certainty: It can happen here, and what comes next will be even ghastlier than you expect. Yet the graphic horrors of Lewis’s vision also limit the book’s usefulness as a guide to our own political moment. In 1935, Lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable: the election of a   candidate to the presidency of the United States. Today’s readers, by contrast, are playing   scrambling to think through the implications of an electoral fait accompli. If Lewis’s postelection vision is what awaits us, there will be little cause for hope, or even civic engagement, in the months ahead. The only viable options will be to get out of the country  —   or to join an armed underground resistance. Lewis’s second wife, the journalist Dorothy Thompson, provided much of the inspiration for “It Can’t Happen Here. ” In 1931, she interviewed Hitler, scoffing at his “startling insignificance” when encountered   . Back in the United States, Thompson interviewed Huey Long, who had vowed to challenge Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency in 1936. She noted that Long’s populist message and swaggering style reminded her of Hitler, and according to Lewis’s biographer, Richard Lingeman, Lewis took the message to heart. A recent Nobel Prize winner, known for his superhuman productivity, Lewis churned out the entire manuscript of “It Can’t Happen Here” between May and August of 1935. The novel arrived in bookstores that October. By that point, some of the immediate threat had passed. (On Sept. 8, 1935, Long was assassinated at the Louisiana State Capitol, one of the great political traumas of the 1930s.) Lewis’s book nonetheless sold 320, 000 copies, becoming his most popular work to date. Reviewers agreed that the book’s success had little to do with its literary merits though “a vigorous   tract,” one critic noted, it was “not much of a novel. ” What propelled its popularity was a sense of urgency, the worry that the United States  —   like the nations of Western Europe  —   might contain dark forces yet to be unleashed. A slightly different sense of urgency seems to be fueling the book’s latest surge in popularity. We have already experienced some of what Lewis describes in the first third of the book: a blustery populist candidate rising, against all odds, to the presidency of the United States. Now the great question is whether or not we are moving into Lewis’s terrifying future. The novel’s Everyman candidate, Berzelius (Buzz) Windrip, is hardly a perfect   for Trump. A creature of the Great Depression and a Democrat, Windrip sweeps into office as a   promising $3, 000 to $5, 000 for every “real American family. ” His movement style evokes the   of Nazi Germany rather than the anonymous jabs of the Twitter mob. Still, there are enough points of resonance to cause palpitations in the heart of any anxious   liberal. Like Trump, Windrip sells himself as the champion of “Forgotten Men,” determined to bring dignity and prosperity back to America’s white working class. Windrip loves big, passionate rallies and rails against the “lies” of the mainstream press. His supporters embrace this message, lashing out against the “highbrow intellectuality” of editors and professors and policy elites. With Windrip’s encouragement, they also take out their frustrations on blacks and Jews. The architect of Windrip’s campaign is a savvy newsman named Lee Sarason, the novel’s closest approximation of Steve Bannon. It is Sarason, not Windrip, who actually writes “Zero Hour,” the candidate’s popular jeremiad on national decline. Sarason believes in propaganda, not information, openly arguing that “it is not fair to ordinary folks  —   it just confuses them  —   to try to make them swallow all the true facts that would be suitable to a higher class of people. ” This is where the novel comes to rest by Inauguration Day: Through a combination of deception and charisma, the feared Windrip ascends to the presidency while the nation’s liberals tremble. It is only after the inauguration, though, that “It Can’t Happen Here” takes a truly dark turn. Upon moving into the White House, Windrip immediately declares Congress an “advisory” body, stripped of all real power. When members of Congress resist, he locks them up without the slightest semblance of due process, the beginning of the end for American democracy. The rest of the book describes one long, disorienting nightmare, a national descent into labor camps and torture chambers and martial law. The novel gains its energy from Jessup’s internal struggle, his regret at having done so little to stop it all while he still could. “The tyranny of this dictatorship isn’t primarily the fault of Big Business, nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work,” he realizes. “It’s the fault of Doremus Jessup! Of all the conscientious, respectable,   Doremus Jessups, who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest. ” With this heavy hand, Lewis seeks not only to satirize American liberals, but to induce them to pay attention before it’s too late. While the book skewers Jessup’s passivity, however, it does little to suggest viable modes of engagement under the Windrip regime, short of abandoning home and family and fleeing to Canada. Every time Jessup attempts some modest act of resistance, he is met with the ruthless repression of the state. When Jessup prints a righteous editorial, Windrip’s goons arrest him and murder his   . Jessup ends up as a   in a concentration camp, beaten down but determined to carry on. Six months into his sentence, he escapes and joins the underground movement percolating in Canada  —   where, the book implies, he should have gone in the first place. The one bright spot for the   forces is that things don’t work out particularly well for anyone else. Windrip never follows through on his pledge to restore prosperity and redistribute wealth, fueling conflict with his early supporters, who mostly end up dead or in jail. Even Windrip himself gets little of what he wants. As president, he insists on absolute obedience, “louder, more convincing Yeses from everybody about him. ” After two years of this treatment, his crafty aide Sarason maneuvers the president into exile, only to be deposed himself a month later in a military coup. By the book’s closing pages, Jessup has returned to the United States as a disciplined resistance fighter, organizing armed rebellions throughout the Midwest. His transformation illustrates Lewis’s most powerful message: When it happens here, everyone should be prepared to resist. But Jessup’s story also underscores how difficult it can be to sort out what to do at moments of swift political change and social confusion. In our brave imaginations, we undoubtedly do the right thing when fascism comes to America. In reality, we might not recognize it while it’s happening."

Pat Michaels and others are working heroically to save America from global central planning for purposes of combatting global warming (or climate change, or whatever they’re calling it now). But let’s also be thankful this holiday season for our Founding Fathers, who wisely created a system based on separation of powers. If the United States had a parliamentary system, there would be no hope of derailing some of the statist schemes being discusssed in DC, even if Pat worked 24 hours a day.   
  
  
The secretary of state, for instance, is issuing pronouncements about putting American tapxayers on the chopping block to help finance $100 billion per year of new “climate change” foreign aid. This money can only be squandered, however, if the House and Senate agree to do so. That’s a real possibility, of course, but at least there’s some hope that common sense will prevail since the fiscal burden of government already is far too large.   
  
  
Here’s a _NY Daily News_ report on what’s happening in Copenhagen, including worrisome signs that politicians who don’t pay for their own travel are planning to make the rest of us pay more for ours: 



The U.S. is prepared to work with other countries toward a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the climate change needs of developing countries,” Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said.



…While she would not disclose how much the U.S. would be contribution to the climate fund, Clinton said there would be a fair amount contributed to the pot that would be made available in 2020. The finances will reportedly be raised partially by taxing aviation and shipping, as proposed by the European Union.

"**The future of American companies in Hong Kong has been thrown into doubt after Donald Trump signed an order to end the city's preferential treatment.**
The US president also signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese officials who crack down on rights in Hong Kong.
The measures came in response to Beijing imposing a new security law in the former British colony last month.
However, analysts are advising business leaders to take a considered approach.
""We are telling clients to take a wait-and-see approach. We just don't have any details yet and this is very vague. This is not the time to freak out,"" Shanghai-based Kent Kedl, partner at consultancy firm Control Risks told the BBC.
""The true impact is unknown. Trump makes these statements and then rounds off the edges afterwards,"" he added.
The decision by the Trump administration to scrap Hong Kong's special status will force non-Chinese companies to re-evaluate their operations in the city.
On Tuesday, The New York Times says it will move some of its Hong Kong staff to Seoul.
And while growing tensions between the US and China are likely to make Hong Kong less attractive in many respects there are also several reasons why the city may remain popular with foreign businesses.
Many Western companies have picked Hong Kong as the location for their regional head offices, covering China as well as countries spanning Japan, Australia, Indonesia and India.
More than 1,500 foreign businesses have Asian headquarters in the city.
Of those firms some 300 are American companies.
There are more than 9,000 overseas and mainland Chinese companies operating in the city, according to the 2019 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong (SCoP).
That number rose by almost 10% between 2017 and last year.
Of those firms more than 1,300 are US companies, with around 85,000 Americans living in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is one of the world's leading financial centres, with a stock market valued at HK$37.9tn ($4.9tn; Â£3.9tn), as of the end of June.
According to the city's stock exchange that figure rose by 16% over the last year.
The exchange saw HK$87.5bn raised by Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in the first six months of this year, a more than 20% increase on the same same period in 2019.
However, Hong Kong saw investment from overseas, known as foreign direct investment (FDI), slump last year.
According to the the United Nation's Investment Trends Monitor, FDI into Hong Kong fell by 48% in 2019.
In contrast rival Asian financial centre Singapore saw FDI increase last year by 42%.
Mr Kedl concluded that, while company bosses shouldn't ignore Mr Trump's announcement, they should hold fire on making a decision on whether to pull out of Hong Kong.
""If we look at Hong Kong on a time scale with an explosion in the middle, our assessment is that we are 'left of boom'. They need to start thinking about this, but not to make a decision yet."""

Well, you’ve got to give **Jacinda Ardern** credit for her chutzpah, if nothing else. Just a month after she publicly berated Australian PM **Scott Morrison** , she is holding out the begging bowl.



New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has asked Scott Morrison to temporarily lift the ban on Kiwis receiving unemployment benefits in Australia during the coronavirus pandemic.



In contrast to her fishwife screeching in Sydney last month, Ardern is suddenly all nicey-nice.



At a press conference on Tuesday Ms Ardern said she had made the request directly to Mr Morrison during a phone conversation.



“I have specifically sought could we have a short-term exemption? Just for these exceptional circumstances for New Zealanders to be supported,” she said.



Maybe Morrison should have [refused to answer](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/zero-diplomacy-as-pm-rebuffs-aussie-pm/) **her** phone call.



When she wasn’t wagging the finger about deporting Kiwi crims, Ardern was preening and lecturing the Australian government about climate change and refugees. As I [wrote at the time](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/arderns-un-diplomatic-immaturity-harms-trans-tasman-relationship/), Ardern’s un-diplomatic immaturity wasn’t helping the trans-Tasman relationship. Now that she wants a favour, Ardern is finding that Morrison is, oddly enough, inclined to turn a deaf ear.



She noted there had been no changes to Australia’s policy since the conversation.



New Zealanders have been excluded access to welfare assistance since 2001.



A number of New Zealanders living in Australia have told SBS News they were extremely worried they would be left destitute without support from the Australian government.



While it’s understandable that New Zealanders running small businesses in Australia are worried about their future, if they’re not Australian citizens, it’s hard to see why they’re Australia’s problem. I stand to be corrected, but I can’t see that Australians in New Zealand are automatically entitled to the same benefits as citizens, [with a few exceptions](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/pensions/travelling-or-moving/social-security-agreements/australia.html#null).



In any case, Australia’s rules are Australia’s rules.



It is unclear if New Zealander sole traders in Australia will have access to small business support provided by the Australian government, but they are currently ineligible for the new increased COVID-19 jobseeker payment.



Ardern does have one good point, though. If nothing else, New Zealanders running businesses in Australia may well be employing Australians.



Ms Ardern said that Australians employed by businesses which have received government assistance may be eligible.



“If they are employed in a firm that has received assistance, my understanding is then they are not excluded from the ability of the business to provide them with support as part of the business and employer packages,” she said.



Australians, like everyone in the Western world, are doing it tough as our economies reel from the impact of COVID-19 and Beijing’s lies. **Naturally, Kiwi expats running businesses in Australia are worried and looking for support.** If only they didn’t have to rely on a prime minister who kicks Australia for cheap popularity points, but then wants to hold hands when it suits her.

Last week, the newly published Gagné et al. (2017) paper received some attention  because the authors pointed out that Arctic sea ice grew substantially between 1950 and 1975, consistent with the in-phase cooling trend during that period.
Gagné et al., 2017     “Updated observational datasets without climatological infilling show that there was an increase in sea ice concentration in the Eastern Arctic between 1950 and 1975, contrary to earlier climatology in-filled observational datasets that show weak inter-annual variations during that time period.”
The AARI [Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute] and Walsh & Chapman sea ice data sets used in the paper (see graph above) included exclusively observational evidence  — “climatological infilling were not included … we only used observed data”.   Both observational data sets indicated that Arctic sea ice concentration anomalies were as low or lower in the early 1950s than they have been during recent decades.
During the early 1950s, CO2 concentrations hovered between 310 and 315 ppm.  Today, atmospheric CO2 has reached 400 ppm.  And yet early 1950s sea ice extent was similar to or lower than today.   This would imply that the Arctic sea ice recession observed in recent decades is well within the range of natural variability, or within the range of what has occurred without human interference or high rates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
In the recently published scientific literature, distinguishing between a presumably human-caused influence on climatic trends and natural or internal variability (or “noise”) has not only become more and more difficult, scientists are increasingly pointing out that an anthropogenic signal in climate trends “has yet to be detected above the level of natural climate variability.”
In addition to the more than 20 new scientific papers affirming a robust connection between solar forcing and climate already published in 2017, there are another new 20 scientific papers that indicate natural variability and/or natural oceanic/atmospheric oscillations (ENSO, NAO, PDO) dominate as modulators of precipitation, temperature/climate, and sea level/flooding.

Natural Variability, Ocean Cycles Dominate And Modulate Precipitation Patterns

1.  Lachniet et al., 2017     “[M]onsoon dynamics appear to be linked to low-frequency variability in the ENSO and NAO, suggesting that ocean-atmosphere processes in the tropical oceans drive rainfall in Mesoamerica. … Climate model output suggests decreasing rainfall as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas radiative forcing (Rauscher et al., 2008; Saenz-Romero et al., 2010). Our data show, however, that the response of the monsoon will be strongly modulated by the changes in ENSO and the NAO mean states … Our data also show that the magnitude of Mesoamerican monsoon variability over the modern era when the anthropogenic radiative forcing has dominated over solar and volcanic forcings (Schmidt et al., 2012) is within the natural bounds of rainfall variations over the past 2250 years. This observation suggests that if anthropogenic forcing has impacted the Mesoamerican monsoon, the signal has yet to be detected above the level of natural climate variability, and the monsoon response to direct radiative forcing and indirect ocean-atmosphere forcings may yet to be fully realized.”

2.  Conroy et al., 2017     “20th century precipitation variability in southern Tibet falls within the range of natural variability in the last 4100 yr, and does not show a clear trend of increasing precipitation as projected by models. Instead, it appears that poorly understood multidecadal to centennial internal modes of monsoon variability remained influential throughout the last 4100 yr. … Until we have a predictive understanding of multidecade to multi-century variability in the Asian monsoon system, it would be wise to consider the risk of prolonged periods of anomalously dry and wet monsoon conditions to be substantial (Ault et al., 2014). Such variability may also explain why the predicted anthropogenic increase in Asian monsoon precipitation is not widely observed.”

3.  Bianchette et al., 2017     “Seven periods of increased water level, varying in duration, occurred during the backbarrier period, with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) likely the main climatic mechanism causing these periodic shifts in the paleo-precipitation levels. We suggest that the deepest water levels detected over the last ~3200 years correlate with periods of increased ENSO activity.”

4.  Clarke et al., 2017     “Corresponding ~4-8 year periodicities identified from Wavelet analysis of particle size data from Pescadero Marsh in Central Coast California and rainfall data from San Francisco reflect established ENSO periodicity, as further evidenced in the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), and thus confirms an important ENSO control on both precipitation and barrier regime variability.”


5. Valdés-Pineda et al., 2017     “This study analyzes these low-frequency patterns of precipitation in Chile (>30 years), and their relationship to global Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs), with special focus on associations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) indices. … We conclude that a significant multi-decadal precipitation cycle between 40 and 60 years is evident at the rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of Chile. This low-frequency variability seems to be largely linked to PDO and AMO modulation.”

6.  Shi et al., 2017     “Five of the six coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3), can reproduce the south-north dipole mode of precipitation in eastern China, and its likely link with ENSO. However, there is mismatch in terms of their time development. This is consistent with an important role of the internal variability in the precipitation field changes over the past 500 years.”


Natural Variability, Ocean Cycles Dominate And Modulate Temperature, Climate

7.  He et al., 2017     “As pointed out by Cohen et al. (2014), continental winter SAT [surface temperature] trends since 1990 exhibit cooling over the midlatitudes. The negative trends extend from Europe eastward to East Asia, with a center of maximum magnitude to the west of the Baikal.  As reviewed above, the AO/NAO [Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation] shows an in-phase relationship with the SAT [surface temperatures] over Eurasia. … [T]he negative trend in the AO/NAO might explain the recent Eurasian winter cooling. … Additionally, the relationship between the winter AO and surface-climate anomalies in the following spring might be modulated by the 11-year solar cycle (Chen and Zhou, 2012). The spring temperature anomalies in northern China related to the previous winter AO were larger and more robust after high solar cycle winters. However, spring temperature anomalies became very small and insignificant after the low solar cycle winters. … Numerous atmospheric scientists have documented that the AO could impact significantly the climate over Europe and Far East. …  It is evident that a positive winter AO causes warmer winters over East Asia through enhancing Polar westerly jet which prevents cold Arctic air from invading low latitudes“


8.  Muñoz et al., 2017     “Temperature and humidity display rapid and significant changes over the Holocene. The rapid transition from a cold (mean annual temperature (MAT) 3.5°C lower than today) and wet Younger Dryas to a warm and dry early Holocene is dated at 11,410 cal yr BP. During the Holocene, MAT [mean annual temperature] varied from ca. 2.5°C below to 3.5°C above present-day temperature. Warm periods (11,410, 10,700, 9700, 6900, 4000, 2400 cal yr BP) were separated by colder intervals. The last 2.4 kyr of the record is affected by human impact [on the pollen proxy record]. The Holocene remained dry until 7500 cal yr BP. Then, precipitations increased to reach a maximum between 5000 and 4500 cal yr BP. A rapid decrease occurred until 3500 cal yr BP and the late Holocene was dry. … The highest rainfall intervals correlate with the highest activity of ENSO. Variability in solar output is possibly the main cause for this millennial to decadal cyclicity. We interpret ENSO [El Niño-Southern Oscillation] and ITCZ [Intertropical Convergence Zone] as the main climate change-driving mechanisms in Frontino.  … From ca. 8000 cal yr BP, climate in both areas was under the dual influence of ENSO and ITCZ, thereby showing existing teleconnections between the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans.”

9.  Park et al., 2017     “According to our results, the central Mexican climate has been predominantly controlled by the combined influence of the 20-year Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the 70-year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). However, the AMO probably lost much of its influence in central Mexico in the early 20th century and the PDO has mostly driven climate change since.”

10. Fan and Yang, 2017     “The wintertime Arctic temperature decreased from 1979 to 1997 and increased rapidly from 1998 to 2012, in contrast to the global mean surface air temperature [which] increased between 1979 and 1997, followed by a hiatus … A recent study suggests a possible role of the Pacific Ocean decadal oscillation in regulating wintertime climate in the Arctic (Screen and Francis 2016). … The ‘‘greenhouse effect’’ of water vapor and clouds  may amplify the effect of winds on Arctic winter climate. [CO2 not mentioned as contributing to the GHE] … The objectives of this study are to assess how much natural–internal variability has contributed to climate changes in these [Arctic] regions from 1979 to 2012 … In summary, the correlation analyses presented in this paper shows a natural mode of Arctic winter variability resulting from the Nordic–Siberian seesaw of meridional winds […] is associated with two-thirds of the interannual variance of winter-mean Arctic temperature between 1979 and 2012, and possibly contributed a substantial fraction of the observed Arctic amplification [1998-2012 warming] in this period.”


11.  Reynolds et al., 2017     “Evidence derived from instrumental observations suggest that Atlantic variability, associated with changes in SSTs and fluctuations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), is directly linked with broader scale climate variability, including Brazilian and Sahel precipitation (Folland et al., 1986 and Folland et al., 2001), Atlantic hurricanes and storm tracks (Goldenberg et al., 2001 and Emanuel, 2005), and North American and European temperatures (Sutton and Hodson, 2005, Knight et al., 2006 and Mann et al., 2009). Furthermore, evidence derived from palaeoceanographic records suggests that a reduction in the meridional heat transport through the surface components of the AMOC was in part responsible for the reductions in temperatures associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 1000–1450) to Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450–1850) transition (Lund et al., 2006, Trouet et al., 2009, Trouet et al., 2012, Wanamaker et al., 2012 and Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014).”

12.  Hao and He, 2017     “Using long-term observational data and numerical model experiments, this study found that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) affects the influence of ENSO-like sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs, which contain variability of both El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) on the interannual change in the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). In the observations, the out-of-phase relationship between the ENSO-like and EAWM was significantly intensified when the AMO and ENSO-like were in-phase. Warmer-than-normal winters occurred across East Asia when the ENSO-like and AMO were positively in-phase, with a significantly weakened Siberian High and anomalous anticyclones over the western North Pacific. The opposite patterns occurred under negatively in-phase conditions.”

13.  Reischelmann et al., 2017     “We document that long-term patterns in temperature and precipitation are recorded in dripwater patterns of Bunker Cave and that these are linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).”

14.  Zaitchik, 2017     “The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of sub-seasonal climate variability in the global tropics. As such it represents an opportunity for intra-seasonal rainfall prediction and, perhaps, for explaining dynamics that underlie longer term variability and trends. … A number of studies have identified statistical links between MJO [Madden-Julian Oscillation] and sub-seasonal rainfall variability in West, East, and Southern Africa. … On longer time scales, there is evidence that MJO activity both modulates and is modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. The implications of these interactions for MJO connections to Africa require further research, as does the potential for trends in MJO behavior and impacts on Africa under global climate change.”

15.  Wu et al., 2017     “The enhanced warming observed in the Eastern China Coastal Waters (ECCW) during the last half-century has received considerable attentions. However, the reason for this warming is still a subject of debate. Based on four different Sea Surface Temperature datasets, we found that the most significant warming occurred in boreal winter during 1982–1998, although the warming trends derived from these datasets differ in magnitude. We suggest that the rapid warming during winter is a result of the asymmetry in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation teleconnection, through which El Niño events induce significant warming over the ECCW at its peak, whereas La Niña events fail to do the opposite that would completely reverse the trends; in addition, there were more El Niño than La Niña events during the recent decades. All these contribute to the winter warming during 1982–1998.”

Natural Variability Dominates Sea Levels, Flooding … Seas Rising Only 1.7 mm/yr

16.  Parekh et al., 2017     “The rate of sea level rise over the Arabian Sea is about 0.5–3 mm/year, whereas over the Bay of Bengal, it is 0.75–6 mm/year. Major contributors to these changes in the Indian Ocean are steric effect and short-term climate variability such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole. This affirms that sea level trends over north Indian Ocean get modulated by inter-annual and decadal scale natural climate variability. The inter-annual variability is stronger than decadal variability, which in turn is stronger than the long-term sea level trend. Sea level change in the Indian Ocean is about 1.5 mm/year in the past sixty years or so, whereas the global sea level trends are a bit higher [1.7 mm/yr].”

17.  McAneney et al., 2017     “Global averaged sea-level rise is estimated at about 1.7 ± 0.2 mm year−1 (Rhein et al. 2013), however, this global average rise ignores any local land movements. Church et al. (2006) and J. A. Church (2016; personal communication) suggest a long-term average rate of relative (ocean relative to land) sea-level rise of ∼1.3 mm year. …The data show no consistent trend in the frequency of flooding over the 122-year [1892-2013]  duration of observations despite persistent warming of air temperatures characterized in other studies. On the other hand, flood frequencies are strongly influenced by ENSO phases with many more floods of any height occurring in La Niña years. … In terms of flood heights, a marginal statistically significant upward trend is observed over the entire sequence of measurements. However, once the data have been adjusted for average sea-level rise of 1.3 mm year−1 over the entire length of the record, no statistically significance remains, either for the entire record, or for the shortened series based on higher quality data. The analysis of the uncorrected data shows how the choice of starting points in a time series can lead to quite different conclusions about trends in the data, even if the statistical analysis is consistent. … In short, we have been unable to detect any influence of global warming at this tropical location on either the frequency, or the height of major flooding other than that due to its influence on sea-level rise.”

Modern Climate Trends Are The Result Of Random Internal Processes, Or Noise

18.  Hu et al., 2017     “[I]t was a challenge to predict the evolution of this warm event, especially for its growth. That is consistent with the fact that the SSTAs [sea surface temperature anomalies] in extratropical oceans are largely a consequence of unpredictable atmospheric variability.  [T]he marked differences in both the spatial distribution and amplitude between Figs. 4 and 3 suggest that maybe only a fraction of the observed variability in NEPO was forced by the SSTA while a large amount of the observed variability may have been a consequence of the atmospheric internal variability (noise). That is consistent with the conclusion from some recent works in examining the climate variability in mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Baxter and Nigam (2015), Hartmann (2015), Lee et al. (2015), Seager et al. (2015), Watson et al. (2016), and Jha et al. (2016). … The remarkable amplitude differences between the observations (Fig. 3) and the simulations (Fig. 4) plus the large fluctuation of the pattern correlation (Figs. 5a, 6a), are indicative of the importance of the atmospheric internal variability (noise) in driving the observed anomalies in NEPO [northeastern Pacific Ocean].  [I]t was a challenge to predict the persistent SST anomalies in the northeastern Pacific because the SST anomaly in NEPO [northeastern Pacific Ocean] is largely controlled by unpredictable stochastic [random] atmosphere variability.”
    [CO2 and/or anthropogenic forcing is not mentioned in the paper.]

19.  Reid, 2017     “The small increase in global average temperature observed over the last 166 years is the random variation of a centrally biased random walk. It is a red noise fluctuation. It is not significant, it is not a trend and it is not likely to continue.”

20.  Stegall and Kunkel, 2017     “These results indicate that there is potential skill in use of GCMs [climate models] to provide projections of hot and cold extremes on the 30-yr timescale. However, it is important to note that natural variability is comparable to the forced signal on this timescale and thus introduces uncertainty.”
[If natural variability is comparable to the forced signal, then attribution becomes highly debatable, uncertain, and closer to guesswork.]

One of the great questions facing policymakers in the 21st century is whether and how to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions so as to limit climate change. Automobiles are a critical part of this policy problem—in the United States, personal transportation accounts for 28 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Gasoline consumption maps neatly into greenhouse gas emissions. This means that a tax on emissions (in the form of a gasoline tax) is feasible. Such a tax can fully restore market efficiency, and alternative policies, such as fuel economy standards, will have inferior welfare properties provided that the environmental externality is the only market failure leading to inefficiencies.



Many have argued, however, that another market failure exists, which is that consumers undervalue energy efficiency in a variety of choice situations, including automobile markets. This hypothesis arises from the observation that engineering estimates of the cost of deploying fuel‐​saving technologies suggest that privately cost‐​effective technologies are often not adopted: the “energy paradox.” If markets substantially undervalue energy efficiency, then the dominance of a gasoline tax over regulatory approaches may be broken because alternative policies may be better able to correct for inefficiencies from consumer undervaluation of energy efficiency.



Motivated by these policy considerations, researchers have sought to determine whether consumers, in fact, undervalue fuel economy. We add to this literature by developing a unique strategy that utilizes data on used‐​vehicle transactions to test whether used‐​vehicle prices change by the amount predicted by a fully rational asset pricing model. We interpret our results as a test of whether consumers fully value fuel economy, and our results provide the parameters necessary for informed policymaking.



Intuitively, our approach is to first compare the prices of two used cars which are identical except in their current odometer readings—and therefore in remaining future operating costs—and second to repeat this comparison when different gasoline prices prevail. We repeat this comparison across many vehicle types and many months, during which changes in the price of gasoline drive changes in fuel costs, to estimate the relationship between vehicle prices and a measure of present discounted fuel costs. For example, we calculate the price and fuel cost of a 2000 Ford Taurus SE six‐​cylinder 3.0L vehicle with automatic transmission and front‐​wheel drive that has 50,000 miles as of July 2005 to another 2000 Ford Taurus SE six‐​cylinder 3.0L vehicle with automatic transmission and front‐​wheel drive that has 60,000 miles as of July 2005. We then calculate the price and fuel cost of two different cars with the exact same configuration and mileages in July 2006. Changes in the gasoline price between July 2005 and July 2006 will cause changes in the difference in expected fuel costs between the higher‐ and lower‐​mileage vehicles. We test whether the change in the price difference between the high‐ and low‐​mileage vehicle over time corresponds to the change in the cost difference.



The fact that our comparison is across vehicles of the same type that differ only in their current mileage allows us to provide an exceptionally rich set of controls. To execute our research design, we employ used‐​vehicle price data that include actual transaction prices, date of sale, vehicle identification numbers, and odometer readings for a large sample of vehicles sold at wholesale auctions between July 1993 and June 2008.



In our baseline specification, we find that vehicle prices do move one‐​for‐​one with future fuel costs. This conclusion is robust to a number of specification checks. Given some simplifying assumptions about the structure of the used car market, this result implies that consumers do value fuel economy properly. This finding casts doubt on the idea that regulatory policies, such as fuel economy standards, might be more efficient than fuel taxation because they correct both the environmental externality and private misoptimization due to limited rationality. Our data come from wholesale auctions, but we are interested in what consumers pay in the retail market.



Using an auxiliary data set from used‐​car guidebooks, we demonstrate that price changes in the retail market appear to pass one‐​to‐​one into retail prices. This is consistent with a competitive used‐​car market, and it allows us to interpret our wholesale price results as directly reflecting consumer willingness to pay in the retail used‐​car market. We are not the first to ask whether consumers value fuel economy properly. Earlier work uses a different empirical strategy that leverages the fact that common gasoline price shocks translate into different fuel cost shocks for different vehicles based on their fuel economies. Compared to these papers, we relax a number of restrictive assumptions. Earlier work finds a range of estimates of consumer valuation across specifications that overlap with each other; some find modest undervaluation while other work cannot consistently reject full valuation.



We interpret our estimates as consistent with these earlier results. Moreover, we believe that our procedure presents a more difficult test because we identify consumer valuation off variation in odometers within a set of otherwise identical vehicles, which may not be salient to consumers. If consumers have limited attention, then we might expect them to ignore the type of within‐​model variation in fuel costs that we leverage. That is, one could imagine consumers recognizing the fuel cost differences across categories of automobiles, but not “noticing” the difference in implied fuel costs across high‐ and low‐​mileage versions of the same model.



Our baseline model produces precise estimates consistent with full valuation. Our procedure yields statistical precision, and our results are robust across a number of dimensions. But, we emphasize that our procedure can be made to yield different results because it relies on assumptions about underlying parameters that we use to construct our estimate of the future fuel costs, including future fuel price forecasts, on‐​road fuel economy performance, and typical patterns of vehicle utilization and scrappage. We have empirical support for each of our assumptions, but reasonable alternatives could shift our coefficient estimate in either direction.



Thus, while the literature fails to consistently reject the hypothesis of full valuation, the data cannot consistently rule out modest undervaluation. What is clear from our results, in conjunction with the existing literature, is that the assumption that consumers place a zero value on fuel economy is indefensible. Nevertheless, this assumption is still employed, implicitly, in regulatory impact analyses that credit the entire fuel savings of consumers as a benefit of programs such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. If consumers value fuel economy properly and automakers deploy fuel‐​saving technologies whenever their cost lies below consumer willingness to pay, then fuel economy improvements forced upon the market by regulation must be causing a trade‐​off in vehicle characteristics or market shares that lowers consumer surplus.



This crediting of fuel savings as a program benefit is often pivotal to the cost‐​benefit analysis. For example, pollution abatement represents only about 20 percent of the total benefits of the 2017–2025 CAFE standards, while fuel savings make up nearly 80 percent of the total benefits. Those fuel savings are estimated to be significantly greater than the total costs of adopting the requisite fuel‐​saving technologies. But, if consumers rationally value fuel economy, then this cannot be so, and some fraction of the benefits are, in fact, being offset by unaccounted for costs related to changes in vehicle design.



Our empirical evidence, combined with the previous literature, implies that consumers at worst undervalue fuel economy modestly. If energy efficient technologies are not being deployed, then researchers and regulators should perhaps shift their attention to supply‐​side explanations, like competitive failures, technological spillovers, or other hold ups within the automobile industry.

"When she wrote recently that “big green groups” are doing more harm than good when it comes to saving the planet, Naomi Klein was was right to be concerned. In recent years the environmental agenda has become heavily corporatised. Unimaginable a few decades back, partnerships between environmental NGOs and big-brand companies have become common. The Environmental Defense Fund led the way in 1990, partnering with McDonald’s to introduce more sustainable packaging. Today, the WWF receives funding from and works with Coca-Cola to “save” polar bears, and acts as “conservation partner” to IKEA. Conservation International has partnerships with Starbucks and Walmart. The Nature Conservatory has partnered with Boeing, British Petroleum, Shell, Monsanto, and Walmart, among many others. Even Greenpeace, one of the more traditionally anti-corporate NGOs, is now cooperating with Unilever and Coca-Cola to promote “Greenfreeze” refrigeration technology (though unlike others, Greenpeace does not accept corporate funding). Ties between environmental NGOs and the world’s largest oil and gas companies have also deepened. To name just a few examples, Time magazine reported in 2012 that “between 2007 and 2010 the Sierra Club, a US grassroots conservation network founded in the 19th century, accepted over US$25m in donations from the gas industry”. The majority of these funds came from Chesapeake Energy, one of the world’s biggest gas drillers. The Nature Conservancy has accepted millions of dollars from British Petroleum (BP) and is currently working with BP to “ensure their oil exploration efforts in the West are done sustainably”. And Antony Burgmans, a non-executive board member of BP, sits on the board of WWF International. While not completely new, such links between environmental NGOs and the biggest retail and energy corporations in the world are now commonplace, and growing in number. As Peter Dauvergne and I argue in our forthcoming book Protest Inc., corporate-NGO partnerships do not represent a simple business takeover of activism. But they do demonstrate a significant shift in the strategy and ethos of many NGOs. They reflect the acceptance of corporations as allies rather than adversaries, and of the market as an efficient and acceptable tool through which to pursue environmental objectives. As many of the big environmental NGOs morph into global business-style institutions, they have come to value win-win moderate calls for “concrete and measurable progress” and impact over more radical disruptive demands to transform the system. A consequence of environmental NGOs opting to co-operate with corporations has been that more effort has gone into market-friendly and consumer-driven activism - eco-certification and eco-labeling, for example, which helps legitimise rather than challenge business as usual. For instance, the WWF/Coca-Cola campaign to “save” polar bears has driven sales of over one billion cans of Coke adorned with a white polar bear. The Sierra Club’s partnership with Clorox rents out the club’s century-old logo to help market a line of “green” cleaning products, in exchange for a percentage of sales. One can only imagine that John Muir, the Sierra Club’s first president and staunch advocate of ecological preservation, would hardly be impressed at the extent of his group’s compromises. Efforts such as these may improve the ecological footprint of individual products and bring revenue to cash-strapped environmental organisations - but they are not fundamentally helping the planet, in fact they reinforce unsustainable patterns of production and consumption worldwide. The great danger of corporatisation is that while environmental NGOs tinker at the edges with efforts to improve recycling and packaging (such as Greenpeace’s campaign to remove the illegal Indonesian paper fibre in Mattel’s Barbie boxes), overall consumption is rising exponentially. So too is the power and profit of the oil and retail corporations whose unsustainable business models drive climate change. Grassroots environmental movements and groups continue to resist and challenge corporatisation. But this does not mean they are unaffected by it. Our research has found that at as global leaders praise corporate-NGO partnerships, politicians, police forces and court rooms in nations such as the UK, US and Canada treat street-level activists — particularly those involved in direct action — increasingly harshly. When credible alternatives are smeared by association, such actions only enhance the power that corporations have to weaken environmental activism."
"**On Tuesday morning, the news started to break from Beijing: China had passed a new security law in Hong Kong.**
The law criminalises any act of secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.
And within minutes, the effect was obvious. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows.
Here is some of the reaction from them, other governments, and campaign groups.
_ **Secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, and key figure in 2014 Umbrella movement**_
""It [the law] marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before,"" said Mr Wong, after announcing he was quitting Demosisto.
""From now on, Hong Kong enters a new era of reign of terror, just like Taiwan's White Terror, with arbitrary prosecutions, black jails, secret trials, forced confessions, media clampdowns and political censorship.
""With sweeping powers and ill-defined law, the city will turn into a secret police state. Hong Kong protesters now face high possibilities of being extradited to China's courts for trials and life sentences.""
_ **Founding chairman of Demosisto, former student leader**_
On Facebook, Mr Law said the law marked the start of a ""bloody cultural revolution"".
But, despite quitting Demosisto, he said he would continue to fight for democracy ""in a personal capacity"".
He added on Twitter: ""Stay strong, my friends. Hong Kong people will not give up.""
Hours after Mr Law, Mr Wong, and others quit Demosisto, the group announced it would disband entirely. ""We will meet again,"" it said.
_ **Pro-independence group**_
Minutes after the law was passed, the group said on Twitter it was disbanding in Hong Kong, but would continue its work overseas. It reportedly has branches in Taiwan and the UK.
Its Hong Kong spokesman, Baggio Leung - who was briefly a member of parliament in 2016 - is also leaving the group.
But the group said the end of operations in Hong Kong did not mean its fight was over. ""Today is not the end point,"" it said.
""From now on, China will have the power to impose its own laws on any criminal suspect it chooses,"" said the head of Amnesty's China team, Joshua Rosenzweig.
""The fact that the Chinese authorities have now passed this law without the people of Hong Kong being able to see it tells you a lot about their intentions.
""Their aim is to govern Hong Kong through fear from this point forward.""
""The move severely impacts Hong Kong society's freedom, human rights and stability,"" said cabinet spokesman Evian Ting, as the Taiwanese government warned its citizens of an increased risk in visiting Hong Kong.
""The government strongly condemns it and reiterates its support for the people of Hong Kong as they strive for democracy and freedom.""
_ **Hong Kong government leader, speaking before the law was passed**_
""There is no need for us to worry,"" Ms Lam said in May.
""In the last 23 years, whenever people worried about Hong Kong's freedom of speech and freedom of expression and protest, time and again, Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values.""
""The core values in terms of the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the various rights and freedoms enjoyed by people, will continue to be there,"" she added."

"A federal judge ruled on Monday that a $37 billion merger between the health insurance giants Aetna and Humana should not be allowed to go through on antitrust grounds, siding with the Justice Department, which had been seeking to block the deal. The deal is one of two   proposed by the nation’s largest health insurers both were challenged by the Obama administration. Another federal judge is expected to rule soon on the case involving Anthem and Cigna, the larger of the two deals, at $48 billion. Citing the sweeping changes to the industry caused by the Affordable Care Act, insurers had embarked on a frenzy of deal making a year and a half ago. The proposed combinations promised to reshape the industry by shrinking the number of the largest insurers to three, from five the largest, UnitedHealth Group, remained independent. Today, the industry finds itself in arguably an even greater state of flux, with President Trump and the   Congress having vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something else, the details of which are unknown. Monday’s decision adds to the uncertainty facing the industry. While the judge found that a merger of Aetna and Humana would not be in the interest of its consumers, companies are likely to remain interested in future combinations. Insurers view mergers as a way to gain greater clout in negotiations with hospitals and doctors. An Aetna spokesman said the company was reviewing the opinion and “is giving serious consideration to an appeal. ” Humana did not respond to an email seeking comment. If the deal falls apart, Aetna would have to pay Humana $1 billion, according to the terms of the merger agreement. The   combination was largely focused around the private market for Medicare Advantage plans, a   area in the industry in which companies offer private insurance as an alternative to the federal government’s traditional Medicare program. Humana, while smaller than its rivals, has a strong position in the Medicare Advantage market and was viewed as an attractive acquisition. But the deal came under sharp criticism from consumer advocates and government officials who argued that the private market was already concentrated: Individuals would suffer from a lack of choice and competition in certain markets. UnitedHealth, Humana and Aetna were the three largest players in the Medicare Advantage market, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation last year. In his ruling, the judge, John D. Bates of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, said the court “mostly agrees” with the Justice Department’s argument that the deal would lessen competition for Medicare Advantage plans as well as individual health insurance sold in state marketplaces. Judge Bates rejected the companies’ rebuttal, saying that government regulation would be unable to prevent the combined entity from “raising prices or reducing benefits. ” He said that neither new competitors nor divestitures would be enough to address the concentration that would result from the merger. The insurers had argued that the merger would allow them to become more efficient, passing those savings on to consumers. But the judge said he did not think the merger would benefit people buying policies, especially in those markets where the combination of the companies would have a large share of the business. “The court is unpersuaded that the efficiencies generated by the merger will be sufficient to mitigate the anticompetitive effects for consumers in the challenged markets,” he wrote. Over the last few years, the Obama administration became more aggressive in blocking deals, especially in health care. The government has blocked mergers among large hospital systems and contributed to dismantling the $152 billion deal between Pfizer and Allergan. Monday’s ruling came six months after the Justice Department sued to block both the Aetna and the Cigna deals. Both were seen as unlikely to succeed, although the merger between Cigna and Anthem was seen as even less likely to be approved because those two companies have more overlap nationally and have been unable to present a unified front. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, also of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, has yet to issue a ruling on that combination, although antitrust lawyers said they did not believe Monday’s decision would affect her decision. “The facts are very different,” said Andrea Murino, a partner and   of the antitrust and competition law practice at Goodwin. While Judge Jackson is likely to look at her fellow judge’s opinion, “she probably made up her mind long ago,” Ms. Murino said. The Justice Department, which has not yet had new leadership installed under President Trump, issued a statement applauding the decision. “This merger would have stifled competition and led to higher prices and   health insurance,” said Brent C. Snyder, a deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the department’s antitrust division. “Aetna attempted to buy a formidable rival, Humana, instead of competing independently to win customers. ” Analysts played down the ability of Aetna to prevail in any appeal of the decision, and Ms. Murino described any challenge to Judge Bate’s decision as “an uphill battle. ” But Matthew L. Cantor, a partner at Constantine Cannon, said Aetna was most likely trying to buy time in making an appeal to see if the Trump administration might be more amenable to some sort of combination. “I wouldn’t be surprised if those kinds of discussions are happening,” he said. Even if both mergers are successfully blocked, analysts predicted there would be continued consolidation as insurers tried other combinations that could make it past the Justice Department and state antitrust officials. Humana’s Medicare Advantage business is particularly attractive in the current environment, Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners, told investors. She mentioned both Cigna and Anthem, which may be looking for merger partners if their deal is blocked, as potentially interested in pursuing Humana. Antitrust experts echoed the idea that the companies, even if they are unsuccessful in their current attempts to merge, would not stop trying. “I don’t think this rules out further consolidation in insurance markets,” Mr. Cantor, of Constantine Cannon, said. Shares of Aetna closed down about 2. 8 percent while Humana’s shares closed up 2. 2 percent. Cigna’s and Anthem’s shares were little changed."
"**A popular mobile game has been taken offline in mainland China for ""rectification work"", after netizens discovered its musical director had written a song containing Morse code with a hidden Hong Kong pro-democracy message.**
According to China's Global Times newspaper, the Cytus II musical rhythm game, produced by Taiwan's Rayark Games, has been removed from China's mainland app stores.
This was done after netizens discovered a controversial song by Hong Kong musical director ICE, real name Wilson Lam, on his Soundcloud account.
The piece, Telegraph 1344 7609 2575, was actually posted on his page in March, but after netizens discovered it contained in Morse code the phrase ""Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times"", many in the mainland called for him to be sacked.
It is unclear who was able to decipher the hidden message, and it is unlikely that anyone within the mainland themselves was able to, given that Soundcloud and YouTube are blocked in China.
Nevertheless, the discovery has ignited lively conversation on popular Chinese microblog, Sina Weibo.
""The person who discovered this is really amazing,"" one user says, receiving more than 200 likes. Others applaud the ""cleverness"" and ""skill"" of someone being able to decipher Morse code.
Many users outside the mainland have also commented on Mr Lam's Facebook page, thanking him for his supporting Hong Kong's activists.
In mainland China, pro-democracy messages in support of Hong Kong activists are heavily frowned upon and there has been active censorship of them. The central Chinese government has criticised activism in Hong Kong as ""separatist"" behaviour that is often ""violent"" and has the potential to cause damage to China as a country.
Mr Lam has since announced his resignation on Facebook. In his statement, he said that his song had ""created controversy resulting in a wide discussion among netizens"".
He said that the song was his ""private activity"" and ""has nothing to do with Rayark Games"" and had offered his resignation ""with immediate effect"".
Rayark Games' mainland agent company, Dragonest Games, have also issued a statement saying that ""further collaboration with the artist will be stopped. We apologise for any impact from the incident and strongly condemn the action of the composer"".
Mr Lam's piece has also been removed from Soundcloud but versions exist on YouTube.
Morse code was a method of telecommunications invented in 1837 using a series of dots and dashes. It played a key role in early transatlantic communications, and was crucial during World War One.
Some popular British TV series programmes have used Morse code in their opening themes.
Barrington Pheloung's Inspector Morse theme included a motif based on the letters M.O.R.S.E; while composer Ronnie Hazlehurst wrote the name of the 1970's comedy starring Michael Crawford into the theme of Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em, a memorable musical joke which reportedly earned him Â£30.

"A documentary following Greta Thunberg and her journey from Swedish schoolgirl to global climate activist accurately portrays her as a “shy nerd”, the teenager said as the film premiered at the Venice film festival. Director Nathan Grossman recorded Thunberg’s everyday life for a year, chronicling her rise to fame from the beginning of her school strike outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to her trips around the world demanding that political leaders take action to fight the climate crisis.  When he began filming, Grossman had no idea that Thunberg, who was 15 when she started her protest, would quickly become the figurehead for the global climate crisis campaign. “I think we have seen a lot of her in the news media, she has been doing so many interviews and I wanted to bring the viewer closer to her, how does it feel to go from nothing to become this very famous climate activist,” Grossman told Reuters in an interview on Saturday. “I was also thinking like, ‘Jesus, everything is going so quickly. What a weird kind of rush … this is’, in a sense that we are standing here with the pope and just eight, nine months ago she started the school strike,” he said. Thunberg, who appeared by video link on Friday at the Venice festival – where I Am Greta has been screened out of competition – said she was pleased with how she was portrayed. “You did succeed in framing me as myself and not the person that the media frames me to be, not the angry, naive child who sits in the United Nations general assembly screaming at world leaders. Because that’s not the person I am,” she said. “So, I think he definitely made me seem like a more shy, nerdy person, which is the person that I am.” She also said the documentary debunked some of the accusations of critics who say she is being manipulated by others. “Some people say that, they spread conspiracy theories … that I don’t think for myself or I don’t speak for myself or someone else writes my speeches … In the movie you can see that that is not actually true and that I do, of course, speak for myself and I decide everything for myself.” Thunberg, who last month returned to school, said the fight against climate change, which has been overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic, should remain a priority. The Venice film festival ends on 12 September. "
"Michael Gove’s proposal to allow all schools in England to set their own holidays is part of a bill aimed at removing “unnecessary burdens” and regulations. But removing some burdens could create others. Some potential complications such changes might present for schools and for families have already been discussed, but there are other unintended consequences. Our particular interest is in energy. The link is not initially obvious, but it is clear that what people do, and when they do it, is important for determining peaks and troughs of energy demand. No one buys gas, electricity or petrol just for the fun of it; they are used for providing power and heat at home, getting to school or to work, and so on. How and when people use these resources, whether they do so at the same time as others, and how they are distributed throughout the year is of direct significance for total energy demand. Changing the length, timing, or coordination of school holidays would have a big impact on the ways in which daily lives are scheduled, and hence on the timing of when energy is used. For one, travel patterns and the school run could be affected. If families with children at several different schools find that their holidays fall during different periods, the journey to school, with its consequences for fuel use and carbon emissions, might have to be extended to cover more days of the year. Potentially such changes could break up familiar patterns of traffic congestion around the school run, sometimes reducing traffic, or potentially making it worse. Either way, peaks and levels of transport-related energy demand are likely to shift as families adapt to new holiday periods. Also consider the energy used in heating and running buildings occupied at different times of the day and year. Currently the longest school holiday period is during the summer, when energy demands are lower. During the Christmas break it’s colder, but the energy burden of keeping warm during the day is shifted from the school (or workplace) to the home. In theory, schools could change the timing and duration of holidays so as to reduce the need for energy intensive heating or lighting – for example by making winter and Easter breaks considerably longer and extending the summer term. Children out of school are generally at home, so this strategy would shift costs from schools to parents. It’s obvious what this would mean for those who pay the bills, but it’s not clear what such a change would mean for total energy consumption. Collective heating systems – as in a school - would more efficiently keep lots of children warm, using less total energy than required to heat and light many private homes through the day. Then again, those homes are already heated for part of the day; extending this by a few more hours (and not heating the country’s schools at all) might entail less energy consumption in total. It would be interesting to see some careful working out of the implications of education policy for energy demand. Somewhat similar calculations have been made in an effort to quantify the energy consequences of putting the clocks back and of thereby shifting patterns of activity into hours of darkness (or light). This is something of an exception. More commonly, little or no attention is paid to the impact that non-energy policies have on the temporal and spatial patterning of daily life, and hence on the energy demands – and carbon emissions - that follow. One way or another, the proposal to de-synchronise school holidays is sure to have tangible, but unintended and unanticipated consequences for energy demand. And yet despite this there is no systematic attempt to think about how this, or indeed any other, non-energy policy affects the extent and timing of energy demand."
"Donald J. Trump ran on a campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. So it should not come as a surprise that he has signed an executive order urging his administration to fight it as much as possible. But that order, alone, won’t allow President Trump to unwind the sprawling health law known as Obamacare. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress are engaged in negotiations about legislation that might substantially undo or replace the health law. Even before the inauguration, Congress  took a first step toward gutting major provisions. But as that process underscores, major changes to health policy will require new legislation. The Trump executive order should be seen more as a mission statement, and less as a monarchical edict that can instantly change the law. Mr. Trump has sent a strong signal that he intends to fight the health law, but he sent signals that were strong on the campaign trail, too, just in less legalistic language. And the order, crucially, notes that agencies can act only “to the maximum extent permitted by law. ” (How the Trump administration interprets those permissions, of course, is yet untested.) The order spells out the various ways that a Trump administration might fight the parts of the health law until new legislation comes: by writing new regulations and exercising discretion where allowed. Regulations can be changed, but, as the order notes, only through a legal process of “notice and comment” that can take months or years. On matters of discretion, the administration can move faster, but there are limited places where current law gives the administration much power to quickly change course. How much of the order is bluster and how much it signals a set of significant policy changes in the pipeline is unclear. The order was not specific and did not direct any particular actions. “Right off the bat, what do they do  —   something incredibly cryptic that nobody understands,” said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president of M. L. Strategies, a Washington consulting firm. Mr. Whitlock was a longtime health policy aide to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. The easiest way for the Trump administration to undermine the health law would be to stop defending a lawsuit brought by the House of Representatives. That suit said  that the Obama administration lacked the authority to pay certain Obamacare subsidies. A lower court ruled for the House, meaning that by simply withdrawing from the appeal, the Trump administration could start a process to eliminate those subsidies and cause a collapse of the insurance market. Mr. Trump’s order said nothing about that policy choice. Another important area of discretion has to do with exemptions to the law’s unpopular individual mandate to obtain insurance. Under the law, all Americans who can afford it are expected to obtain health insurance, unless they have experienced some hardship that would make it impossible. People who feel there has been such a hardship can apply for an exemption, and employees in the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service can decide on their case. Under a Trump administration, it might become easier to claim hardship and get out of the requirement to buy insurance. But people seeking those exemptions will still have to apply for them, in writing, and can do so only at particular times of the year. Current law requires them to provide documentation supporting their claim that they have recently filed for bankruptcy, for example, or been evicted, and they must legally attest to their honesty. The Trump administration could create new categories of hardship, but that would take time. And rules that effectively eliminate the requirement would almost certainly result in litigation. “It’s not a hardship to have to comply with the law, almost by definition,” said Timothy Jost, a professor of law at Washington and Lee University. Mr. Jost, who supports the health law, has examined the underlying regulations in detail. Defanging the individual mandate could have significant consequences for the individual insurance markets. If fewer healthy people buy insurance, the costs of insuring everyone else will rise, leading insurance companies to raise prices or flee the market. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office published its estimate of what would happen under a law that eliminated the mandate and some other provisions: 18 million people would lose their insurance next year alone. It’s possible that insurers will look at the language of the order and get skittish, setting off a market collapse next year. But the order itself doesn’t yet change any rules. The health and human services department and the I. R. S. will have to take further action. “Is this mostly a symbolic gesture or a signal that they intend to take apart the law piece by piece to the extent they can?” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. “At a minimum, this creates a lot of uncertainty for insurers at a pretty critical time. ” The order directs the administration to give states more autonomy in directing health policy. And there’s a clear mechanism for that: Medicaid law provides a process in which states can waive many of the program’s usual rules to attempt “demonstration projects. ” Administrations have latitude under the law to decide what sort of new programs qualify. Mr. Trump’s selection for the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, has been an innovator in pushing this process in more conservative directions. Her selection, even more than the order, was a sign that the Trump administration would become more open to new Medicaid rules, including possible work requirements to obtain coverage, or premiums even for very poor Americans. But, as with the exemptions, there is still a process for such policy changes. States must submit detailed applications for waivers for the rules, and there is a legal review process that typically takes months. Mr. Trump recently promised that his team was developing a health care plan far better than the Affordable Care Act, that would insure more people and lower their costs. For people who heard that and thought Mr. Trump had gone soft on Obamacare, his executive order may come as a shock. But nothing in the order changes the law on its own. Whether Mr. Trump’s intention is a smooth transition or a rapid disruption in current policy will be determined by what comes next."
"**China's parliament has backed security legislation for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory.**
The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - has caused deep concern among those who say it could end Hong Kong's unique status.
It could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time.
The move has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest.
Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law.
Security remains high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continues.
At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system.
""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said.
The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews.
Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September.
But hours before the vote was taken in Beijing, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China.
That meant that Hong Kong no longer merited being treated differently from the mainland under US law.
The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and drew an angry reaction from Chinese authorities in the territory.
In a strongly worded statement on Thursday, the office of China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's statement and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs.
It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"".
On Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the UK was ""deeply concerned"" about the new security law, which ""risks undermining the principle of 'one nations, two systems'"".
Japan said it was ""seriously concerned"" by Beijing's move. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained.
The National People's Congress (NPC) - meeting in Beijing after a two-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic - backed the security bill resolution with 2,878 votes in favour, one against and six abstentions.
""It will uphold and improve the 'one country, two systems' policy,"" NPC chairman Li Zhanshu told delegates during the closing ceremony.
""It is in line with the constitution and Hong Kong's Basic Law and is in the interest of all Chinese people including Hong Kong people,"" he added.
The NPC only ever approves legislation put to it by the government so there was no chance the bill would not be supported.
The legislation - referred to as the Draft Decision - now passes to the Standing Committee of the Communist Party which will draw up the full details of the new law.
It is expected to criminalise:
The resolution also says that ""when needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law"".
That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own.
The authorities in Hong Kong insist the law is essential to tackle growing violence and ""terrorism"", and that the territory's residents have nothing to fear from it.
Critics fear it could lead to Hong Kongers being prosecuted - even retroactively - for criticising their or the mainland's leadership, joining protests or exercising their current rights under local laws.
Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle.
They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.
Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law.
But its unpopularity meant it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests.
Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.
China is keen to avoid a repeat of that unrest."
"**Boris Johnson says the UK's extradition arrangements with Hong Kong will be changed, amid rising tensions with China.**
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is expected to suspend an extradition deal with the territory later.
It comes after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law on the ex-British colony, introducing new crimes with severe penalties.
China has accused the UK of ""brutal meddling"" in its affairs.
The UK has already offered residency rights and a path to UK citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers in response to the law's imposition.
Beijing has insisted it is committed to upholding international law, and has promised a ""resolute response"" if the UK withdraws from extradition arrangements.
The extradition treaty means that, if someone in Hong Kong is suspected of a crime in the UK, then the British authorities can ask Hong Kong to hand them over to face justice - and vice versa.
The UK fears the arrangement - which has been in place for more than 30 years - could see anyone it extradites to Hong Kong being sent on to China.
Hong Kong has extradition agreements with 19 other countries apart from the UK, including Canada and Australia, which have already suspended theirs following the imposition there of China's new security law - which makes acts of subversion punishable by life sentences.
Mr Johnson said the UK had ""concerns"" over the new law, and it had to think about the rights of people in Hong Kong to participate in democratic processes.
But he added: ""There is a balance here. I'm not going to be pushed into a position of becoming a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue, somebody who is automatically anti-China"".
""We've got to have a calibrated approach. We're going to be tough on some things, but we're going to continue to engage.""
The UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 but, as part of an agreement signed at the time, it enjoys some freedoms not seen in the mainland.
But political and economic relations between the UK and China have become strained in recent months.
Earlier this month, the UK decided to ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from its 5G network, citing security concerns denied by the company.
The UK, US and EU have accused Beijing of undermining the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle, which has guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong since it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997.
They say the security laws which came into force last month breach the terms of the 1984 Joint Declaration protecting political and economic freedoms - which agreed the conditions under which Hong Kong would be run when Britain gave it back to China in 1997.
The UK denounced the new laws as ""deeply troubling"", with the foreign secretary calling the move ""a grave step"".
In response, the UK has offered the 350,000 Hong Kong residents who hold British Overseas National passports - and a further 2.6 million who are eligible for them - enhanced residency rights should they wish to come to the UK and a route to possible citizenship.
But China has warned it will retaliate if the UK imposes sanctions on any of its leading officials in relation to human rights offences and allegations of police brutality in Hong Kong.
Proposals for an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and mainland China provoked widespread protests last year amid concerns about political interference in the Chinese judicial system and the right to a fair trial.
**Analysis by James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent**
Suspending extradition to Hong Kong is a very obvious step to take.
Even if the treaty remained fully in place, it would be hard to imagine the circumstances in which the UK would now agree to hand over any suspect to the Hong Kong authorities for trial - knowing they might end up in a Chinese mainland court, and then a prison far from Hong Kong.
British suspension of the treaty - rather than outright abandonment - is quite normal.
Diplomatically, it allows China a way back, however unlikely it is there will be any retreat by Beijing.
The UK does not want to be the side to initiate a trade war with China, hence the focus on justice and the rule of law.
China has already warned - in the context of Huawei as well as Hong Kong - that Chinese businesses may judge Britain an unsuitable or unreliable partner in future.
The UK won't be the one turning up the heat in that area. But further British measures against China can't be ruled out.
The UK has also stepped up its criticism of China's human rights record, accusing Beijing of ""gross and egregious"" abuses against the Uighur population in Xinjiang province.
Mr Raab told the BBC that reports of forced sterilisation and wider persecution of the Muslim group were ""reminiscent of something not seen for a long time"".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would support a change to extradition arrangements with Hong Kong, calling it a ""step in the right direction"".
But he called on the government to ""go further"" by considering immediate sanctions on Chinese officials involved in rights abuses against Uighur Muslims.
Drone footage that has been widely circulated - and authenticated by Australian security services - appears to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains.
However, China's UK ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, dismissed talks of concentration camps as ""fake"".
On Monday Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said accusations of forced sterilisation of Uighurs in Xinjiang were ""nothing but lies""."
"LONDON  —   Patrick Stobbs recently sat in a conference room here playing songs from his smartphone, attempting to show how his   Jukedeck, is at the cutting edge of music. The tune sounded like the soundtrack to a 1980s video game. “This is where we were two years ago,” he said, looking slightly embarrassed. “And this is where we are now,” he continued. He then played a gentle piano piece. Its melody was simple, and it was unsubtle in its melancholy, but there was no denying that it could work as background music for, say, a health insurance commercial. Mr. Stobbs didn’t write the music himself, nor did he commission it from a composer. Jukedeck is one of a growing number of companies using artificial intelligence to compose music. Their computers tap tools like artificial neural networks, modeled on the brain, that allow the machines to learn by doing, rather as a child does. So far, at least, these businesses do not seem to be causing much anxiety among musicians. “We see our system as still in its infancy it’s only learnt a certain amount about music,” Mr. Stobbs said, although he quickly hinted how he hoped Jukedeck’s music could advance: “There’s no rule of physics that says computers can’t get as good as a human. ” Having machines write music is not new. In the 1950s, the composer Lejaren Hiller used a computer to produce the “Illiac” Suite for string quartet, the first   score. Since then, countless researchers have pushed that work forward. But several   are now trying to commercialize A. I. music for everything from jingles to potential pop hits. Jukedeck, for instance, is looking to sell tracks to anyone who needs background music for videos, games or commercials. The company charges large businesses just $21. 99 to use a track, a fraction of what hiring a musician would cost. Mr. Stobbs wouldn’t reveal how many tracks it has sold, but said that the British division of   pays for a monthly subscription. Tech giants are also involved. In June, Google Brain announced Magenta, a project that aims to have computers produce “compelling and artistic” music, filled with surprises. Its efforts so far do not quite fit the bill. In September, DeepMind, the   British artificial intelligence company, also released results of an experiment it undertook for fun. DeepMind put samples of piano music into its WaveNet system, used to generate audio, such as speech. The system, which was not told anything about how music worked, used the initial audio to synthesize   clips that sound like   jazz. IBM also has a research project called Watson Beat, which musicians will be able to use to transform their work’s style, making songs sound Middle Eastern, for example, or “spooky. ” Jukedeck’s beginnings are somewhat surprising for a tech company. Mr. Stobbs and the composer Ed   both 29, founded it in 2012. They had been choristers at King’s College School in Cambridge, England, and Mr.   went on to study music at the University of Cambridge, where he first learned that artificial intelligence could compose. After graduating from Cambridge, the pair set up a choral boy band (“a terrible idea,” Mr. Stobbs said) and had aspirations to run a record label. But in 2010, Mr.   attended a computer science lecture at Harvard, where his girlfriend was studying. The lecturer made coding sound relatively straightforward, and also made Mr.   recall his earlier studies in A. I. music. He decided to put the two together, and he set about building Jukedeck on the flight home. Jukedeck’s system involves feeding hundreds of scores into its artificial neural networks, which then analyze them so they can work out things like the probability of one musical note’s following another, or how chords progress. The networks can eventually produce compositions in a similar style, which are then turned into audio, using an automated production program. It has different networks for different styles, from folk to “corporate”  —   something that sounds like the glossy electronica typically played at business conferences. The company only recently started experimenting with the artificial neural networks for the audio output as well as the composition. This should make tracks sound more natural and varied  —   more human, in other words. Other companies working on A. I. music tend to involve musicians more directly in the process. The Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris, for example, considers musicians essential to its Flow Machines project, which has received funding from the European Research Council. The idea behind the project is to get computers to write pop hits, said François Pachet, the laboratory’s director. “Most people working on A. I. have focused on classical music, but I’ve always been convinced that composing a short, catchy melody is probably the most difficult task,” he said. He added: “A compelling song is actually a rare and fragile object. It can only work if all the dimensions are right: the melody, the harmony, the voice, the dress of the singer, the discourse around it  —   like, ‘Why did you write this song?’ No one is able to model all that right now, and I’m interested in that problem. ” Flow Machines’ main system is a composing tool that works similarly to Jukedeck’s: by getting a computer to analyze scores  —   everything from Beatles’ songs to dance hits  —   so that it can learn from them and write its own. However, its output is then given to musicians, who are free to use it, change it or throw it away as they like, at no charge. (Negotiations are underway regarding contractual obligations if record labels release any of this music.) Musicians give “a sense of agency,” Mr. Pachet said. “The systems don’t know why they want to make music. They don’t have any goal, any desire. ” Around 20 acts have already used the system, Mr. Pachet said, some performing the songs they wrote using it at a recent concert. He is in talks with some   groups, like the indie band Phoenix, to try it, he added, and several albums will be released this year. Musicians appear to enjoy it. “I could never have written a song like the one I did without it,” said Mathieu Peudupin, a French rock musician who goes by the name Lescop. “It drove me to a place I would never have gone myself. ” He said it was like working with a bandmate, although he ignored most of its suggestions. “But what singer in the world listens to his bandmates?” he said, laughing. Mr. Pachet and Lescop both said they did not think listeners would ever entirely accept   music. “Music fans need to fall in love with musicians,” Lescop said. “You can’t fall in love with a computer. ” But the founders of Jukedeck are less certain. Mr.   sees artificial intelligence changing the way we listen, especially if computers eventually “understand music enough to make it respond in real time to, let’s say, a game, or you going for a run,” he said. “Recorded music’s brilliant, but it’s static. If you’re playing a game, Hans Zimmer isn’t sitting with you composing. I think responsive systems like that will be a big part of the music of the future. ”"

There have been several papers published in the last decade that have been trying to claim that global warming is causing declining Arctic sea ice, and that in turn is causing increased snowfall and colder winters in the Northern Hemisphere. There was lots of wailing and screaming about the “polar vortex” and even the White House got into the act by releasing a ridiculous video that claimed that weather feature was a direct result of climate change. But, this new study suggests that those extreme winters were within range of normal variations. Of course, things like that don’t make headlines or becomes tools for political points with the White House. Here’s the video by White House Science adviser Dr. John Holdren.

That video was soooo bad, that many people in the know pointed out its flaws even before it finished playing that 2 minutes, even going so far as to claim it was nothing more than quickly cobbled together propaganda like something from the HotWhopper (aka Miriam O’Brien) school of schlock. A judge agreed, as this May 9 2016 story from the Washington Times reports:

Obama White House showed ‘bad faith’ in global-warming case, judge rules
The White House showed “bad faith” in how it handled an open records request for global warming data, a federal court ruled Monday, issuing yet another stinging rebuke to the administration for showing a lack of transparency.
For President Obama, who vowed to run the most transparent government in U.S. history, Judge Amit P. Mehta’s ruling granting legal discovery in an open records case — the third time this year a judge has ordered discovery — is an embarrassing black eye.
In this most recent case, the Competitive Enterprise Institute was trying to force the White House office of science and technology policy to release documents backing up Director John C. Holdren’s finding that global warming was making winters colder — a claim disputed by climate scientists.
Dr. Judith Curry on her blog notes that:  “a 2014 paper published in Science by Tim Palmer titled Record breaking winters and global climate change argued that rising greenhouse gas emissions may have played a role in the severe 2013-2014 winter in the U.S. midwest via a mechanism whereby global warming has caused changes in the location of the jet stream tied to warming of the surface waters in the tropical west Pacific.”
There is now this new paper by Sigmond and Fyfe Published in Nature Climate Change which rebuts Tim Palmer’s notion the notion that  tropical Pacific changes have increased the probability of the unusually cold winters observed in recent years.
Tropical Pacific impacts on cooling North American winters 
Michael Sigmond & John C. Fyfe
Abstract. The North American continent generally experienced a cooling trend in winter over the early 2000s. This cooling trend represented a significant deviation from expected anthropogenic warming and so requires explanation. Previous studies indicate that climate variations in the tropical Pacific contributed to many mid-latitude climate variations over the early 21st Century. Here we show using  large ensembles of fully-coupled, partially-coupled and uncoupled model simulations that in northwest North America the winter cooling was primarily a remote response to climate fluctuations in the tropical Pacific. By contrast, in  central North America the winter cooling appears to have resulted from a relatively rare fluctuation in mid-latitude circulation that was unrelated to the tropical Pacific. Our results highlight how decadal climate signals – both remote and local in origin – can together offset anthropogenic warming to produce continental scale cooling.
The paper can be seen here: http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3069.html
Curry writes: (bold mine) The methods used in the paper combine global observations, and a series of climate model experiments that include fully coupled, partially coupled (constrained by observations) and uncoupled (atmosphere only) simulations. Excerpts:
Having established that the models used in our study reproduce the observed linkages between the tropical Pacific and North America, we now investigate their simulated trends in the early 21st Century. First we employ the ensemble of fully-coupled CanESM2 simulations to explore potential links between variations in the simulated ΔSAT (surface air temperature) trend and variations in the simulated SAT trend averaged over NWNA (northwest North America). [There is] a positive trend in ΔSAT  (corresponding to a weakening zonal temperature gradient) and a relatively small cooling trend over NWNA.  This indicates that had the simulated tropical Pacific variability in the model been aligned in time with that observed that it would have likely simulated the  observed cooling over NWNA. This is our first line of evidence that the observed winter  cooling over NWNA from 2001-2002 to 2013-2014 was a remote response to decadal  changes in the tropical Pacific. Our second line of evidence is obtained from an  ensemble of partially-coupled CanESM2 simulations where surface wind stress in the  tropics is constrained to follow its observed monthly evolution from January 1979.  In all of these so-called “pacemaker” experiments the observed trade wind intensification and associated ΔSAT increase is associated with cooling surface temperatures over NWNA. These results are consistent with relationships that  exist between winter-to-winter fluctuations and 14-year trends in ΔSAT and NWNA SAT.
Indeed, it appears that the Aleutian Low weakening observed over the early 21st Century, arguably the most pronounced feature in recent Northern Hemisphere SLP (sea level pressure) trends, can be attributed to tropical Pacific climate variations. Moreover, the associated cold air  temperature advection was sufficient to overcome the externally-forced warming to cause cooling over NWNA. By contrast, tropical Pacific related SLP trends over the east coast of North America drove southwesterly winds to produce warming, rather than  cooling, over CNA (central North America). Hence, tropical Pacific variability cannot explain the observed winter  cooling over CNA.
It is clear that tropical Pacific SAT trends played an important role in early 21st Century mid-latitude climate trends, particularly over NWNA. We ask if this is due to cooling in the central to east Pacific, or due to warming in the west tropical Pacific? To address this question we employ uncoupled simulations using CanESM2. We perform control runs with  prescribed SST and sea-ice averaged over the period between 1997 and 2007, and simulations that use the control SST and sea-ice except over the key regions.
In  response to warming in only the west tropical Pacific a slight warming of CNA is found, contradicting the notion that west tropical Pacific warming was responsible  for the observed CNA winter cooling. Our analysis indicates that tropical Pacific changes during the early 21st Century produced a warming impact over CNA.
Using our uncoupled simulations, we  investigate the speculation [of Palmer] that the probability of these unusually cold winters may have increased due to the tropical Pacific changes. To arrive at statistically robust conclusions, we extended the uncoupled control simulation and the simulation with SST changes in the tropical Pacific region, where the  SST and sea-ice fields were taken from observations. We find that it is  less likely to find a colder winter in the perturbed simulation than in the control simulation. Hence, our results contradict the notion that tropical Pacific changes have increased the probability of the unusually cold winters observed in recent years.
If the recent CNA winter cooling cannot be attributed to tropical variability, then what  was its cause? To address this question we return to the large ensemble of coupled  CanESM2 simulations and note that in three of 100 ensemble members a stronger than observed CNA winter cooling was simulated. Figure 6 shows the average simulated  climate trends over the five ensemble members with the largest CNA winter cooling.  As in observations this cooling is the result of northerly winds associated with a ridge of  increased SLP over the west coast of North America and CNA. The composite shows that outside the mid-latitudes there are no climate trends that are substantially different from the forced response. This indicates that the observed CNA  winter cooling over the early 21st Century was not a response to decadal changes in  the tropical Pacific, but was instead the result of a local internally-generated fluctuation  in circulation that was unrelated to the tropical Pacific.
Our analysis shows how remotely and locally generated decadal climate variations  have offset anthropogenic warming to produce North American winter cooling over the  early 21st Century. Similar to the slowdown in the rise of global-mean surface temperature this cooling is very likely to be a temporary feature, as future decadal  variations could be opposite in sign and amplify anthropogenic warming of North  American winters.

In other words, the AGW signal that Michael Mann claims to have teased out, and we can see on TV news reports, is in fact overwhelmed by business as usual natural variation. It might be visible in the future, but right now the evidence is about as scarce as the hairs on Mann’s head.
Added: lest we forget this parody created at the time by Minnesotans for Global Warming, here it is again.

‘Fraudulent research makes it past gatekeepers at even the most prestigious journals’

London 31 October:  A new report published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation reveals the extent to which current policy-making is reliant on untrustworthy peer-reviewed research, much of which cannot be replicated and “may be simply untrue”.

click on the image above to watch a short video about the GWPF report
“Fraudulent research makes it past gatekeepers at even the most prestigious journals,” says Donna Laframboise, the study’s author and the investigative journalist behind the 2011 exposé of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) entitled: The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert.

The report, entitled Peer Review: Why Skepticism is Essential, describes the peer-review process as “haphazard and byzantine”, raising serious questions about the state of modern science and casting doubt on policies that claim to be ‘evidence-based’.
Laframboise explains:
“A policy cannot be considered evidence-based if the evidence on which it depends was never independently verified… News from the worlds of astrobiology, ecology, economics, chemistry, computer science, management studies, medicine, neuroscience, psychology, and physics all tell the same tale: ’peer-reviewed’ does not equal ’policy-ready’.”
This has striking implications for climate change policy, and particularly for the IPCC, which relies on the credibility of the peer-review process to provide support for its conclusions, and is quick to dismiss research that has not been peer-reviewed.
Laframboise describes how the now-disgraced former IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri was once asked if an Indian environment ministry report might alter the IPCC’s pessimistic view of Himalayan glaciers. The ‘IPCC studies only peer-review science’, Rajendra Pachauri replied dismissively. Until the report’s data appears in ‘a decent credible publication’, he said, ‘we can just throw it into the dust- bin’.”

"**The US, UK, Australia and Canada have issued fresh condemnation of Beijing's new security law for Hong Kong, which they say has ""flourished as a bastion of freedom"".**
They say the international community has a ""significant and long-standing stake"" in its prosperity and stability.
China's move to impose the new law during a global pandemic risked undermining trust in governments and international co-operation, they said.
China has rejected foreign criticism.
The law - approved by China's parliament on Thursday - has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest in Hong Kong.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China.
This could lead to Hong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status.
The UK on Thursday said visa rights for 300,000 British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong would be extended into a ""pathway to future [UK] citizenship"" if China did not suspend its security law plans.
Direct imposition of the security law by Beijing rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions would ""curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties"" and ""dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous"", the statement says.
It would also conflict with China's international obligations within the Sino-British declaration, under which Hong Kong was returned to China, and would both undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle and ""raise the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes"".
The allies also say they are ""deeply concerned"" that the new law will deepen divisions in Hong Kong, which has seen repeated waves of protests and clashes over the territory's relationship with the mainland.
""Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year,"" the statement says.
The US and its allies urge China to work with Hong Kong's government and people to find a ""mutually acceptable accommodation"".
In other reaction, Japan said Hong Kong was an ""extremely important partner"" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained.
China's parliament has backed the security legislation, which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong.
The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time.
Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September.
However it is expected to criminalise:
Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform.
China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it ""firmly opposed and refuted"" Mr Pompeo's assertion that Hong Kong had lost its autonomy and urged the US to ""immediately stop meddling"" in China's internal affairs.
It described US criticism of the new draft law as ""utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless"".
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has denied that the law would curtail the rights of Hong Kongers and said it was a ""responsible"" move to protect the law-abiding majority.
Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law.
Security remained high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continued.
At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system.
""I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten,"" he said.
The speaker deemed the package to be an ""unknown dangerous object"", and called police and fire crews.
Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle.
They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.
Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law.
But its unpopularity meant it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests.
Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.
China is keen to avoid a repeat of that unrest."
"Most people saw the warm dry weather from June to September as a welcome, but freak, occurrence. Because, as anyone who invested in floaty dresses, barbecues or expensive sunglasses in previous years will know, recent summers in Britain and north-western Europe have been unusually wet. From 2007 to 2012, sunshine has been lower and rainfall higher than average, with 2012 - the summer that never was - the wettest for more than a century. With rainfall 80% higher than average, there were frequent floods, substantial damage to property, deaths and serious consequences for farming and tourism. At the same time, during these summers, the amount of Arctic sea ice was very low. The summers between 2007 and 2012 were the six lowest years on record, with 2012 an all-time low. Could melting sea ice and wet summers be related? In my recent study I used a climate model to investigate what impact the loss of Arctic sea ice has on weather patterns over Europe. The amount of sea ice cover in the model was changed in a controlled manner while other factors known to influence European weather were held constant. This allowed me to isolate and measure the affects of melting sea ice. The model confirmed that when sea ice cover shrunk, the UK and north-western Europe experienced wetter summers. The pattern of rainfall anomalies in the model looked very similar to those observed in recent years. It seems reasonable to conclude that the loss of Arctic sea ice is one contributing factor in these washed-out summers. Another factor that strongly influences the quality of European summers is the position of the jet stream. Jet streams are currents of strong winds, around 10km up in the atmosphere. Generally these winds blow from west to east, carrying weather systems and rain with them. During the summer, the jet stream normally lies between Scotland and Iceland, so heavy weather is carried through the Atlantic north of the British Isles. But when the jet stream shifts south, as it did for prolonged periods during the summers between 2007 and 2012, that unseasonable wet weather makes landfall in the UK. The model confirmed that melting sea ice causes the jet stream to shift further south than normal, increasing the frequency of cloudy, cool and wet summers over north-western Europe. In contrast, Mediterranean Europe experienced drier conditions as sea ice was reduced. However, missing sea ice is only partially to blame for these soggy summers. A previous study showed how European rainfall is influenced by a slow natural cycle of warming and cooling in the uppermost levels of the North Atlantic. Since the late 1990s, the Atlantic has been in the warm phase of that cycle - known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - which is thought to bring with it greater risk of wet summers. So the combination in recent years of low Arctic sea ice and a warmer Atlantic have further increased the odds of wet summers. Together these two factors help explain our lack of sunshine and booming welly sales through the last few summers. But there is one other factor that cannot be ignored: the natural, chaotic and completely unpredictable element of weather systems - not least in Britain, which has always had a more than average amount of unpredictable weather. Atmospheric variability can, and often does, exceed the influence of Arctic sea ice. Melting sea ice may increase the odds of a wet summer, but it will not lead to a wet summer every year. Buying extra lottery tickets increases your chances of winning, but clearly does not guarantee success. This summer just gone is perhaps a timely reminder - despite warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and lower-than-average Arctic sea ice cover, summer 2013 turned out to be quite warm, dry and sunny. The Met Office reports that the UK’s 2013 summer was [the driest since 2003](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/2012/summer.html](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/2012/summer.htm). What does this all mean for future summers? Will there be opportunity to wear those dresses again before the moths get to them? The Atlantic Ocean will return to its cool phase in the next decade, which is expected to bring with it warmer and drier summers. But Arctic sea ice on the other hand is expected to continue melting, favouring potentially wetter summers. The outcome of this climate tug-of-war is uncertain and hard to predict - and in that respect, it’s business as usual for the British weather."
"Stephen Fry, Mark Rylance and a former Archbishop of Canterbury are among 150 public figures to hit back at government moves to classify the climate protesters of Extinction Rebellion as an “organised crime group”. In a letter to be published in the Observer on Sunday, XR is described as “a group of people who are holding the powerful to account” – who should not become targets of “vitriol and anti-democratic posturing”. It comes in response to the prime minister and home secretary’s reported move to review how the group is classified in law after it disrupted the distribution of four national newspapers, including the Sun and the Daily Mail, last Saturday. Around 100 protesters – who erected bamboo structures outside two Rupert Murdoch-owned printing presses in Hertfordshire and Merseyside – were accused last week of undermining the UK’s free press by Boris Johnson, the home secretary Priti Patel and the Labour leader Keir Starmer, among other figures. Starmer said: “The free press is the cornerstone of democracy and we must do all we can to protect it. Denying people the chance to read what they choose is wrong and does nothing to tackle climate change.” And last week Guardian News and Media stated: “We fully support the right to protest – but we do not condone any action that restricts the public’s right to access journalism and buy whichever newspaper they choose.” But today’s letter states: “Extinction Rebellion has helped push the government’s failure to act on the climate and ecological emergency into the public eye. Whether or not we agree with their tactics or targets, by blocking printing presses and delaying newspaper distribution, they have connected the dots of a broken system. For the past 30 years, there’s been a woeful lack of serious reporting on the climate and ecological emergency due to the billionaire owners’ vested interests, and a lack of understanding from reporters, to editors to senior executives, about the severity and scale of the crisis. This has meant a terrifying delay on action to combat climate change.” The letter cites the UK’s Covid-19 death toll and a “recovery plan that allocates billions of taxpayer’s money to the fossil fuel economy” as examples of the government failing the public. The artist Cornelia Parker OBE, among the letter’s signatories, told the Observer: “They’re almost like our conscience. Calling them criminals or terrorists is absurd. Very old people and children join these protests – these are ordinary people.” The sculptor Antony Gormley, also among the signatories, said: “[XR is] being used as a scapegoat for climate inaction, and it’s ridiculous to be calling them criminals when actually it is lackadaisical and inept actions of the government and indeed, those in charge of massive corporations, that should be doing much, much more. “Their strategy is constantly trying to find new pressure points to make us act,” he added. “I’m not convinced that all of their activities can be totally justified. However, the fundamental reasons for them wanting to raise consciousness are absolutely justified.”"
"**US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has criticised banking giant HSBC for supporting China's move to impose new security legislation in Hong Kong.**
Mr Pompeo also said the US stood with its allies against China's ""coercive bully tactics"".
The Trump administration has repeatedly attacked Beijing for what it says is an attempt to end Hong Kong's autonomy.
HSBC, which is UK-based but was formed in Hong Kong in 1865, declined to comment on Mr Pompeo's remarks.
US-China ties have deteriorated rapidly since the start of the year over Hong Kong and the coronavirus pandemic.
The statement on Tuesday by America's top diplomat came after both HSBC and Standard Chartered expressed support for China's national security legislation in Hong Kong.
Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) ""browbeating"" of HSBC ""should serve as a cautionary tale"".
He said that last week's signing of a petition supporting the new legislation by HSBC's Asia-Pacific CEO, Peter Wong, was a ""show of fealty seems to have earned HSBC little respect in Beijing, which continues to use the bank's business in China as political leverage against London"".
Mr Pompeo said that the US was prepared to help the UK after Beijing reportedly threatened to punish HSBC and drop commitments to build nuclear power plants in the UK unless it allowed China's Huawei to build its 5G phone network.
He also repeated that Washington sees Huawei as ""an extension of the Chinese Communist Party's surveillance state"".
Last month, China's parliament approved a resolution that would impose legislation on Hong Kong that criminalises criticism of the city's government.
Senior UK and US politicians last week also criticised HSBC and Standard Chartered after they both backed the national security law for Hong Kong.
Both HSBC and Standard Chartered have their headquarters in London, but make most of their profits in Asia, with Hong Kong serving as a major base for their operations.
On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that HSBC's chairman, Mark Tucker, had warned Britain against a ban on networking equipment made by Huawei, claiming the bank could face reprisals in China.
A spokeswoman for Standard Chartered said the bank had no comment to make on Mr Pompeo's statement."

Like many of us, I’m quite surprised by the absurd calls for impeachment of a President who has done nothing wrong. Just because he does things people don’t agree with and is sand in the Establishment machinery, this in no way constitutes grounds for impeachment. It’s a grand charade.
Will backfire on media-political mob
Don’t get discouraged by all the spectacular theatrics, as this can turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Newton’s Laws also often apply in politics: for every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction. There’s a good chance this is all going to backfire, and possibly even on a nuclear scale. People don’t appreciate bureaucrats who abuse the justice system to go unfairly go after someone.
Alan Dershowitz: “like Stalinist Russia”
As the blatant non-objectivity and hatred becomes ever glaring, people are taking notice and seeing this for what it really is: a political lynching. One example is Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a left-wing Democrat and supporter of Hillary Clinton no less.
Watch the latest video at &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=”//video.foxnews.com”&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;video.foxnews.com&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
“What’s the crime?”

In an interview at FOX News, Dershowitz, one of the country’s top civil liberties lawyers, totally blasted the media-political mugging of President Trump, comparing it to “Stalinist Russia”, and demands to know: “What’s the crime?”
Political charade
The Harvard professor noted: “Nobody can point me to a statute that could be violated.” Moreover Dershowitz sees Trump possibly getting benefit from it all, and expresses full confidence in Mueller.
In fact, Dershowitz says the worst case scenario is Flynn getting indicted, refering to him as a low-level former aid. Dershowitz thinks in the end it’ll end up helping Trump. This is why Trump supporters, barring any surprises, can rest easy and relish at the prospect of the coming public backlash.
And even if Trump had coordinated with the Russians in the Wikileaks dump, that too would not be a crime, says Dershowitz. In fact the real issue is Clinton wrongdoings exposed by the Wikileaks.
German ARD public television: the world’s most Trump-hating
Interestingly in Germany, almost everyone believes Trump commited crimes, even though they don’t know what they are talking about. This is so because most Germans get their news filtered by the publicly funded media outlets, like ARD television. A recent report on mass negative reporting of Trump found that Germany’s flagship ARD public television took the top spot worldwide in negativity, with 98% of its reports being negative, RT here writes. (PS: RT is just the messenger here).
Most Germans I meet say they simply cannot understand how Americans could have elected Trump. And as long as they continue relying on outlets like ARD for information, they surely never will.

"During Labor Day weekend in 2019, I was in Big Sur with my pals Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette. I’ve been an environmental activist since the 1970s, installing a windmill at my ranch in 1978 and solar electricity in my Santa Monica home in 1981, speaking at rallies. And later, getting an electric car, stopping my use of single-use plastic and cutting back on red meat. But I was still ill at ease. I had just learned that there are 2.9 billion fewer birds in North America than there were in 1970. I knew that sea turtles are being strangled by tumours caused by pollution in the oceans, and untold numbers of people were living in the midst of oil wells and refineries. But I hadn’t really focused on what the scientists were saying. I knew we needed to invest in clean energy alternatives, fast, but these things remained a disturbing reality sitting out there somewhere, removed from me.  I knew this fatalist thinking was a cop-out. Catherine reminded me recently how, on the five-hour drive to Big Sur, she would go on an hourly rant: What can I do? Where are the leaders? I need someone to tell me what to do! I felt impotent, angry with myself for my inability to give her answers because I felt the same way. The morning we left for Big Sur, I’d received an advance copy of Naomi Klein’s book, On Fire: The (Burning) Case For A Green New Deal. I was moved by the way Naomi wrote about Greta Thunberg, the brave, young student exhorting us to get out of our comfort zone and do something. And the fact that we don’t stand a chance at changing course in time without profound change. When you’re famous, there are so many ways to lift issues and amplify voices. God knows I’ve done it before, with varying degrees of success. I knew what I needed to do, and I felt it so strongly I was quivering all over. “I’m going to move to Washington DC for a year and camp out in front of the White House to protest against climate change,” I told Rosanna and Catherine over dinner. “If Greta can do it, so can I.” I’d said it to my pals, and I couldn’t back out. Being brave, gung ho gals, Catherine and Rosanna were all for it and pledged to join me when they could. Over the next few days we hiked, and I kept reading Naomi’s book. I felt more strongly that if I got the word out, others would join me. It had happened before during the later years of the Vietnam war. I’ve done a lot of camping in my life and had all the right equipment, but I’d never camped in a city. Where will I poop and pee? I wondered. I’m way older now and have to get up during the night more often. We studied maps of DC, trying to pick a spot where I would set up, but I realised I didn’t want a lonely vigil. I needed expert help to plan this. That’s when I decided to call Annie Leonard, the director of Greenpeace USA. “Annie, it’s Jane Fonda here, do you have a minute? I’m reading Naomi’s book, and I’ve decided to move to Washington for a year and camp out in front of the White House. I want to start in three weeks. Can you help me figure it out?” I’m someone who, when she gets an idea, is 100% ready to take a leap of faith. In fact, leaps of faith are my only form of exercise these days. There was a long silence, and then she said, “Well, Jane, that’s wonderful and I’m blown away that you’re ready to put yourself out there like that, but you can’t camp overnight in Washington. It’s illegal since Occupy Wall Street camped there. But let’s figure out what is possible.” She offered to set up a conference call with her, Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, Naomi Klein, the environmental lawyer Jay Halfon, and me. Bill suggested a once-a-week protest that involved civil disobedience. Fridays had been claimed by Greta Thunberg and the student climate strikers, but the youth had also called on adults to join them. “Maybe you could do an action on Fridays as well.” I’d been getting ready for this my whole adult life – a weekly action that culminated in nonviolent civil disobedience. And I wouldn’t have to worry about pooping. I began planning for the maximum time I could spend in DC before I had to get ready to film our last season of Grace And Frankie on 27 January 2020. It added up to four months, 14 Fridays. I asked Debi Karolewski, who began assisting me in the early 80s, to come with me. I knew I’d need my little dog, Tulea. I couldn’t imagine being without her for four months. I also knew how sad I’d be not to see my 10-week old grandson, Leon, for that long. But I had come to realise that as important as our individual lifestyle decisions are, they cannot be brought to scale in time to get us to where we need to be by 2030. It’s structural change that we need to focus on while continuing our individual commitments to the planet. Maybe the Friday actions would help bring about that policy change. On 27 September, en route to the Los Angeles airport, my little Tulea had a seizure; she had been diagnosed with an enlarged heart. My own heart sank as I came to grips with the fact that I’d have to leave her behind. I conjured up the image of Greta. You have to leave your comfort zone. I left. It wasn’t easy. • What Can I Do? by Jane Fonda is published by HQ, at £20. To order a copy for £17.40, go to guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply."
"The devastating wildfires now sweeping across the western US are among the sparks from climate change that could ignite a financial crisis by damaging home values, state tourism and local government budgets, an advisory panel to a US markets regulator found. Those effects could set off a cascade of events including defaults and market disruptions, undermining the economy and sparking a crisis, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  More than 85 significant fires are currently burning across the west, destroying communities in California, Oregon and Washington state. “As we’ve seen in the past few weeks alone, extreme weather events continue to sweep the nation, from the severe wildfires of the west to the devastating midwest derecho and damaging Gulf coast hurricanes. This trend – which is increasingly becoming our new normal – will likely continue to worsen in frequency and intensity as a result of a changing climate,” said Rostin Behnam, CFTC commissioner. “Beyond their physical devastation and tragic loss of human life and livelihood, escalating weather events also pose significant challenges to our financial system and our ability to sustain long-term economic growth,” said Behnam. The CFTC sees climate change impacting the US economy in several major ways. First, global warming is making the western US hotter and drier, with wildfires more frequent and intense, scientists say. Economists have traditionally seen natural disasters like wildfires as localized shocks. That’s changing, according to the report, produced by a 35-member panel for the CFTC. The group included representatives of major oil companies, banks and asset managers. Cal Fire, California’s firefighting agency, says about 3m of the state’s 12m homes are at high risk from wildfires. That designation hurts home values, which in turn increases mortgage default risk, research cited by the report suggested. More defaults would damage banks, mortgage holders and markets where mortgages are sold. Securities based on mortgages were a trigger for the 2007-2009 financial crisis. After 2018, California’s worst fire season on record so far, in terms of loss of life and property, some insurers balked at renewing homeowner policies, forcing a record number of owners to turn to pricey policies from the state’s insurer of last resort. Expensive insurance also depresses home prices, said former California insurance regulator Dave Jones, a contributor to the CFTC report. “You can tell the same story in terms of sea level rise and flooding and more intense storms and their impact on residential real estate value,” said Jones, now a senior director at the Nature Conservancy. In turn, lower home values reduce cities’ real estate tax revenue and impair their ability to repay debt, potentially leading to bond defaults. Fire-related business disruptions such as a drop in tourism that slashed sales and lodging tax revenue could also hurt municipal finances. Stresses could build in the US financial system in what the report termed “a systemic crisis in slow motion”. Many Californians are experiencing orange skies, and shots such as darkened skies over San Francisco’s famous Golden Gate Bridge were beamed to television screens around the world, for example. Climate catastrophes can make investors aware of risks not priced into markets, the report said, and this can “trigger a disorderly repricing of assets, which could have cascading effects on portfolios and balance sheets and, therefore, systemic implications for financial stability”. “The central message of this report is that US financial regulators must recognize that climate change poses serious emerging risks to the US financial system, and they should move urgently and decisively to measure, understand, and address these risks,” the report concludes."
"**China says any US travel ban on members of its Communist Party would be ""pathetic"", in the latest sharp exchange amid souring bilateral ties.**
The New York Times had earlier reported the Trump government was considering the move, although it is still in draft form and could be rejected.
The Chinese Communist Party has 92 million members and how a ban would be enforced is uncertain.
US-China ties have become increasingly strained over a wide range of issues.
The US this week removed Hong Kong's preferential trade status, after China brought in a controversial new security law for the territory.
President Donald Trump has also criticised China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its military build-up in the South China Sea, its treatment of Muslim minorities and massive trade surpluses.
The article in the New York Times cites four people ""with knowledge of the discussion"".
The ban would stop members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families from visiting the US and could possibly expel some people already in the country, the paper says.
Officials at state-owned enterprises and of the People's Liberation Army could also be affected, although many would also be party members.
The Times itself says the plans have not been finalised and the president could dismiss them, and that the White House and the State Department had declined to comment.
The president could use the Immigration and Nationality Act, under which travellers from a number of mostly Muslim countries were banned in 2017.
The Times also points out that the US has no knowledge of Communist Party membership, making enforcement difficult, and that although three million Chinese visited the US last year, the numbers have evaporated amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The US currently bans arrivals of foreign nationals who have visited China in the past 14 days with ""specific exceptions"".
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Thursday responded to a question which said the Trump administration was considering a total ban on party members.
She said: ""If that is true, I think that is utterly pathetic.""
More broadly she said: ""We know that some in the US are oppressing China and bullying China. As an independent sovereign state, China must respond to the bullying practices and we must say no, we must... take reactive moves to it.""
Analysts say any travel ban imposed by the US would almost certainly prompt retaliatory action on Americans visiting China.
The Communist Party is the country's sole, ruling political party. It controls the highest functions of government, through the National Congress, but also reaches far down into lower-level administration.
About 7% of the population are members of the party - loyal membership is essential for anyone who wants to climb the career ladder - whether in politics, business or even entertainment.
That even goes for people like e-commerce giant Alibaba's Jack Ma, telecomm company Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei or celebrities like actress Fan Bingbing.
Hua Chunying touched on a couple of other issues too.
Last week, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.
Ms Hua invited US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to visit Xinjiang to see for himself that there were no such violations.
She also said China would stick to the ""phase one"" trade deal it had reached with the United States earlier this year after a damaging tariff war.
Mr Trump said this week a ""phase two"" deal was in doubt because of China's handling of coronavirus, which he called the ""plague"".
The US officially withdrew last week from the World Health Organization, which Mr Trump had accused of being beholden to China.
His administration has also condemned China's military build-up in the South China Sea, where several countries have competing territorial claims. The US has accused China of bullying its neighbours.
China said it was not afraid of the threat of sanctions over the issue, accusing Washington of stirring up trouble and destabilising the region."
"Norm Kalmanovitch
17 November 2009
The entire basis for the concept of global warming being caused by CO2 emissions is both predicated and dependent on the answer to a simple question:
“How much of the thermal radiation energy from the Earth in the band centred on the 14.77micron wavelength that is resonant with the vibrational mode of CO2 has already been affected by the current atmospheric CO2 concentration and how much energy remains to be affected?”
This question was never addressed by Svante Arrhenius in his seminal 1896 paper because that paper predates quantum physics and he was not aware that the process by which thermal energy is affected by CO2 is limited to a single vibrational mode with a resonant wavelength of 14.77microns.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
20 years ago climate models were celebrated as a huge breakthrough. Finally we were able to reproduce reality in the computer, which had been becoming ever more powerful and faster. Everyone believed that only minor adjustments were necessary, and the target would be reached. But when the computer-crunched results were finally compared to reality, huge unexplained discrepancies appeared.
In parallel, paleo-climatologists produced increasingly robust reconstructions of the real climate development, which served to make the computer problems even more glaring. Month after month new papers appeared exposing the major problems of the climate modelers. Model tests were preferably started in the middle of the Little Ice Age, around 1800, because the warming seemed to fit well with the rise in CO2 emissions.
But if one goes back 1000 years, the model technology falls apart.
In March 2016 Fabius Maximus pointed out the obvious: The models have to be more strictly tested and calibrated before they can be approved for modeling the future.
We can end the climate policy wars: demand a test of the models
[…] The policy debate turns on the reliability of the predictions of climate models. These can be tested to give “good enough” answers for policy decision-makers so that they can either proceed or require more research. I proposed one way to do this in Climate scientists can restart the climate change debate & win: test the models!— with includes a long list of cites (with links) to the literature about this topic. This post shows that such a test is in accord with both the norms of science and the work of climate scientists. […] Models should be tested vs. out of sample observations to prevent “tuning” the model to match known data (even inadvertently), for the same reason that scientists run double-blind experiments). The future is the ideal out of sample data, since model designers cannot tune their models to it. Unfortunately…
“…if we had observations of the future, we obviously would trust them more than models, but unfortunately observations of the future are not available at this time.”
— Thomas R. Knutson and Robert E. Tuleya, note in Journal of Climate, December 2005.

There is a solution. The models from the first four IPCC assessment reports can be run with observations made after their design (from their future, our past) — a special kind of hindcast.”
Another large point of criticism on climate models is the so-called “tuning”. Here climate models are adjusted so that they nearly produce the desired result. This takes part mostly in clandestine rooms behind closed doors where there is little transparency. Hourdin et al. 2016 described the problem in detail in an assessment paper. Judith Curry sums it up best:
Two years ago, I did a post on Climate model tuning,  excerpts: “Arguably the most poorly documented aspect of climate models is how they are calibrated, or ‘tuned.’ I have raised a number of concerns in my Uncertainty Monster paper and also in previous blog posts.The existence of this paper highlights the failure of climate modeling groups to adequately document their tuning/calibration and to adequately confront the issues of introducing subjective bias into the models through the tuning process.”
Think about it for a minute. Every climate model manages to accurately reproduce the 20th century global warming, in spite of the fact that that the climate sensitivity to CO2 among these models varies by a factor of two. How is this accomplished? Does model tuning have anything to do with this?”
Read the entire post at Climate Etc.
In November 2016 in the renowned journal Science, Paul Voosen described the necessity of ending all the secrecy and black boxes in order to allow some public transparency:
Climate scientists open up their black boxes to scrutiny
Climate models render as much as they can by applying the laws of physics to imaginary boxes tens of kilometers a side. But some processes, like cloud formation, are too fine-grained for that, and so modelers use “parameterizations”: equations meant to approximate their effects. For years, climate scientists have tuned their parameterizations so that the model overall matches climate records. But fearing criticism by climate skeptics, they have largely kept quiet about how they tune their models, and by how much. That is now changing. By writing up tuning strategies and making them publicly available for the first time, groups hope to learn how to make their predictions more reliable—and more transparent.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDaniel Wetzel of online German daily Die Welt here writes Germany is hosting 1200 experts from 93 countries at its Foreign Affairs Ministry in Berlin to discuss reductions in global “climate gas” emissions and “climate protection”.
But there is one small, highly embarrassing problem with the event: host Germany has not been able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions over the past 8 years, despite tens of billions invested in green energy. Last year German CO2 emissions in fact rose by some 6 million tonnes, from 902 million tonnes in 2015 to 908 million tonnes.
Die Welt’s Wetzel reports that the timing of the news “couldn’t be worse” and that it is “embarrassing” for host Germany which was once considered a shining example of how to transition over to a clean energy economy.
The reality id that most of Germany’s reductions since 1990 resulted from the shutting down the filthy communist-run industries in former East Germany — something that was achieved by modern industry. Very little progress has in fact been made since 2000, when the renewable energy drive began in earnest — despite the now over 1 trillion euros committed thus far.

Die Welt’s Wetzel not only writes that Germany’s progress in reductions is embarrassing, but that the country will also surely miss its 2020 reductions target of 40%. Currently Germany has cut reductions by 27.6%, and that has not gone anywhere since 2009. Again, the lion’s share of reductions came from shutting down East German communist-run industry.
The Berlin climate summit will be joined by leading German federal ministers from Angela Merkel’s government, such as Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries and Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks, all from Merkel’s coalition SPD socialist partner. There’s no mention if any minister from Merkel’s CDU party will bother attending.
Wetzel writes that if the global community wishes to meet its 2050 targets, the rate at which renewable energy gets installed will have to increase 7-fold!
As Science Skeptical writes that is likely not going to happen as the planet continues to gallop from one emissions record to another.

"We are responsible for pollution but not for climate change.
Half the people in the world believe that we control climate, but climate change has gone on for the millions of years of Earth’s existence.  The drivers are the vast powers of the sun,  the moon, the oceans and earth’s continental drift and concomitant vulcanism. To say we can stop it is nearly as silly as crossing to the other side of the street in order to stop continental drift which has gone on for the same time.  That big handsome American fraud Al Gore got a Nobel Prize and makes millions by persuading some people that he can control climate.
What we humans are responsible for is pollution, which we must stop for our own good.

An interesting [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3550308) has been presented showing an apparent link between COVID-19 hotspots and **cooler temperatures**. The authors state that the virus has “established significant community spread in cities and regions only along a narrow east west distribution roughly along the 30-50 N” corridor at consistently similar weather patterns (5-1O°C and 47-79% humidity).” 



The team noted that the outbreak areas had similar temperature, humidity, and latitude. In addition, the timing of the initial outbreaks coincided with the coldest portions of the year and none of the areas experienced minimum temperatures below freezing. The temperatures and humidity of the affected areas were reported to be similar to laboratory testing of conditions that are conducive to the survival of the coronavirus. Survival of the SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov were also determined to be limited by temperature and humidity. 



The temperature graph, above, is of the northern winter, our summer so what is the situation when the seasons reverse?



From the same data [source](https://climatereanalyzer.org/reanalysis/monthly_maps/): (for the months June – August last year)



 **NOTE** : The colour banding is different, the 5 – 10°C is green in the second image.



And New Zealand is right in the middle of that. Prime time for person-to-person spread is our normal cold and flu season.



Could it possibly be that the only long-term defence against COVID-19 is global warming?

Wind Turbine Blade Waste By 2050

“If the industry cannot come up with more sustainable manufacturing and disposal processes, public acceptance of wind energy would decline if the public becomes aware of these issues” – Ramirez-Tejeda et al., 2017

Despite an explosion in installed wind capacity since 1990, wind power had achieved just 0.39% of the world’s total energy consumption as of 2013.

Image Source

Germany has assumed a leading role in promoting the consumption of renewable energy.  And yet even in Germany the share of energy consumption from wind power reached only 2.1% in 2016.
Despite its extremely limited infiltration as a world energy source, it is assumed that a rapid expansion of wind power will ultimately be environmentally advantageous both due to its reputation as a “clean” energy and because of the potential to contribute to reduced CO2 emissions.
Recently, however, the austere environmental impacts and health risks associated with expanding wind energy have received more attention.
For example, scientists have asserted that wind turbines are now the leading cause of multiple mortality events in bats, with 3 to 5 million bats killed by wind turbines every year.   Migratory bats in North America may face the risk of extinction in the next few decades due to wind turbine-related fatalities.

Frick et al., 2017
“Large numbers of migratory bats are killed every year at wind energy facilities. … Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (λ = 1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a substantial threat to migratory bats in North America.”

Wind Turbine Blades Last 20 Years…And Then They Are Tossed Into Landfills

Besides reducing wildlife populations, perhaps one of the most underrated negative side effects of building wind turbines is that they don’t last very long (less than 20 years) before they need to be replaced.  And their blades aren’t recyclable.  Consequently, 43 million tonnes (47 million tons) of blade waste will be added to the world’s landfills within the next few decades.

Liu and Barlow, 2017
“The blades, one of the most important components in the wind turbines, made with composite, are currently regarded as unrecyclable.  With the first wave of early commercial wind turbine installations now approaching their end of life, the problem of blade disposal is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future. … The research indicates that there will be 43 million tonnes of blade waste worldwide by 2050 with China possessing 40% of the waste, Europe 25%, the United States 16% and the rest of the world 19%.”
“Although wind energy is often claimed to provide clean renewable energy without any emissions during operation (U.S. Department of Energy, 2015), a detailed ecological study may indicate otherwise even for this stage. The manufacture stage is energy-intensive and is associated with a range of chemical usage (Song et al., 2009). Disposal at end-of-life must also be considered (Ortegon et al., 2012; Pickering, 2013; Job, 2014).A typical wind turbine (WT) has a foundation, a tower, a nacelle and three blades. The foundation is made from concrete; the tower is made from steel or concrete; the nacelle is made mainly from steel and copper; the blades are made from composite materials (Vestas, 2006; Tremeac and Meunier, 2009; Guezuraga et al., 2012). Considering these materials only, concrete and composites are the most environmentally problematic at end-of-life, since there are currently no established industrial recycling routes for them (Pimenta and Pinho, 2011; Job, 2013).”


In a new paper entitled “Unsustainable Wind Turbine Blade Disposal Practices in the United States“, Ramirez-Tejeda et al. (2017) further detail the imminent and unresolved nightmare of wind turbine blade disposal.   The environmental consequences and health risks are so adverse that the authors warn that if the public learns of this rapidly burgeoning problem, they may be less inclined to favor wind power expansion. Advocates of wind power are said to be “largely ignoring the issue”.  It’s an “issue” that will not be going away any time soon.
In light of its minuscule share of worldwide consumption (despite explosive expansion in recent decades), perhaps it is time to at least reconsider both the benefits and the costs of wind energy expansion.

‘Adverse Environmental Consequences’ For A Rapidly Expanding Wind Power Grid

“Globally, more than seventy thousand wind turbine blades were deployed in 2012 and there were 433 gigawatts (GW) of wind installed capacity worldwide at the end of 2015. Moreover, the United States’ installed wind power capacity will need to increase from 74 GW to 300 GW3 to achieve its 20% wind production goal by 2030.  To meet the increasing demand, not only are more blades being manufactured, but also blades of up to 100 meters long are being designed and produced.”
“The wind turbine blades are designed to have a lifespan of about twenty years, after which they would have to be dismantled due to physical degradation or damage beyond repair. Furthermore, constant development of more efficient blades with higher power generation capacity is resulting in blade replacement well before the twenty-year life span.”
“Estimations have suggested that between 330,000 tons/year by 2028 and 418,000 tons/year by 2040 of composite material from blades will need to be disposed worldwide. That would be equivalent to the amount of plastics waste generated by four million people in the United States in 2013. This anticipated increase in blade manufacturing and disposal will likely lead to adverse environmental consequences, as well as potential occupational exposures, especially because available technologies and key economic constraints result in undesirable disposal methods as the only feasible options.”


Problems With Landfills

“Despite its negative consequences, landfilling has so far been the most commonly utilized wind turbine blade disposal method. … Landfilling is especially problematic because its high resistance to heat, sunlight, and moisture means that it will take hundreds of years to degrade in a landfill environment. The wood and other organic material present in the blades would also end up in landfills, potentially releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other volatile organic compounds to the environment.”
“The estimated cost to put blade material in landfills, not including pretreatment and transportation costs, is approximately US $60 per ton. [A typical blade may weigh 30-40 tons].  In the United Kingdom, where landfilling organics is not yet prohibited, the active waste disposal cost (which includes plastics) is approximately US $130 per ton.”

Problems With Incineration

“Incineration of blades is another disposal method with potential for energy and/or material recovery. … Combustion of GFRP is especially problematic because it can produce toxic gases, smoke, and soot that can harm the environment and humans.  Carbon monoxide and formaldehyde have been reported as residue from thermal degradation of epoxy resin.  Another residue is carbon dioxide, which poses concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, about 60% of the scrap remains as pollutant ash after the incineration process, some of which is sent to landfills, potentially contaminating the sites. Possible emission of hazardous flue gasses is also among the issues with incinerating wind turbine blades.”
“One key issue is that all these thermal processing techniques for wind turbine blades would also require fragmentation of the material into smaller pieces through mechanical processing before being fed into the reactors, increasing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.”

Problems With Mechanical Processing

“Mechanical processing is a relatively simpler disposal method that consists of cutting, shredding, and grinding the material to separate the fibers from resins, so it can be repurposed. This process is energy intensive and produces small fiber particles with poor mechanical properties that can only be used as filler reinforcement material in the cement or asphalt industries. … The dust emitted in the grinding process of FRP creates occupational health and safety risks for workers. Inhalation, as well as skin and eye contact can produce moderate irritation to mucous membranes, skin, eyes, and coughing. Occupational exposure and prolonged inhalation of such particles have been found to produce alterations of the cellular and enzymatic components of the deep lung in humans, identified as acute alveolitis.”

Problems With Chemical Degradation

“The last method is chemical degradation, which consists of first mechanically reducing the size of the blades, then degrading them using a chemical solution. … Although no industrial-level chemical recycling of thermoset polymers has been done yet, some hazardous chemicals such as nitric acids and paraformaldehyde have been used in testing and development processes.  Occupational exposure to these chemicals can produce harmful respiratory diseases including potential nasal cancer, and dermal health effects.”


Advocates Of Wind Power ‘Have Largely Ignored The Issue’

“Few individuals and organizations recognize the problems inherently related to blade recyclability. This situation creates an obstacle for promoting policy interventions to solve these problems. As a result, manufacturers, wind farm operators, and advocates have largely ignored the issue, focusing efforts on promoting wind energy and addressing other issues such as negative impacts on wildlife and noise generation.”
“If the industry cannot come up with more sustainable manufacturing and disposal processes, public acceptance of wind energy would decline if the public becomes aware of these issues, inhibiting its growth as one of the main sources of electricity generation in the United States.”

The German electricity consumer advocacy group NAEB projects that Germany’s electric power rates will continue to soar, possibly reaching an industry back-breaking 45 euro cents per kilowatt-hour by 2020, and even higher over the years that follow.

NAEB power price projections for 2020. Note that the horizontal scale changes at the year 2010 in order to condense the chart. The upper curve shows German electricity prices in euro-cents per kilowatt-hour, the middle curve shows the price for France and the lower curve for the USA. Source: NAEB.
Currently German power costs about 30 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour, and so are among the highest worldwide. The price is projected to soar another 50% rise to 45 cents by 2020. That would make German power 4 times more expensive than US power, and more than double that of France. This poses a real threat to German economic competitiveness.
Although the growth in German electricity prices have slowed some since 2015, the gap between German prices and other competing countries is as gaping as ever, with no relief in sight. In fact USA’s prices could even soon begin to ease off.
The NAEB writes:
For the Germany curve, one clearly sees the effects of market liberalization starting in the mid 1990s. Since 2000 the Energiewende mercilessly went into action! In 2015 we updated the estimates.”
The trend bodes ill for Germany’s energy-intensive sectors such as chemicals, glass and cement. The growing chasm compared to prices in USA and France risks a severe erosion of Germany’s domestic industry and long-term economic growth.

"Recently Zac Goldsmith MP – a former editor of The Ecologist, no less – branded the views of Environment Secretary Owen Patterson as “grotesque” after the minister called anti-GM campaigners “wicked”. Mr Goldsmith stated: GM has never been about feeding the world, or tackling environmental problems. It is and has always been about control of the global food economy by a tiny handful of giant corporations. It’s not wicked to question that process. It is wicked not to. By saying as much Mr Goldsmith drags up arguments that are out of date and out of place. Golden rice is a bio-fortified, genetically modified Oryza sativa rice crop that offers a nutritionally enriched staple for those who cannot afford or obtain a balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables. Golden rice can be produced by subsistence farmers in developing countries using varieties adapted to local conditions. Access to the technology is free. Lack of vitamin A causes blindness and death in over a million children under five that do not have access to a balanced diet, every year. For many their staple diet is rice, but rice does not produce vitamin A in the grain even though it has all the genes necessary to do so (and in fact does so in the leaves). The inventors of golden rice, Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg, worked out how to “turn on” the synthesis of vitamin A in the edible grain itself by inserting two genes, resulting in a rice variety with boosted vitamin A levels. Widespread adoption of golden rice could decrease deaths due to vitamin A deficiency by an estimated 25% or more. This is a result, and a crop, that could not be achieved using conventional breeding. From the outset golden rice was a public good project governed by the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board. Swiss biotech company Syngenta contributed to the project by developing improved varieties in their labs but arranged that any intellectual property associated with golden rice was licensed free of charge to allow the technology to be available to resource-poor farmers who are permitted to save seed. There is no catch or hidden agenda, yet anti GM campaigners continue to have a blanket condemnation on the technology, linking it to corporate conspiracies and control of the global food economy. The science of genetic modification has moved on considerably over the last 15 years and has answered many of the concerns raised about GM and its commercial applications. Indeed golden rice nullifies all the arguments against GM: it has not been developed for commercial profit; it fulfils an urgent need by complementing traditional interventions; it presents a sustainable, cost-free solution, not requiring other resources; those who benefit are poor and disadvantaged; it is given free of charge and without restrictions to subsistence farmers; it does not create any new dependencies and can be grown without any additional inputs; it does not create advantages to rich landowners; it can be resown every year from the saved harvest; it does not reduce agricultural or natural biodiversity; and there is no conceivable threat to the environment or to human health. Yet protestors continue to promote misinformation and destroy field trials. Many refuse to engage in a meaningful dialogue and discuss GM issues on a case-by-case, evidential basis. For the first time since the introduction of GM crops almost two decades ago, developing countries now grow more than industrialised countries, contributing to food security and alleviating poverty in some of the world’s most vulnerable regions. The technology is not forced onto growers. Today over 17m farmers in 29 countries grow GM crops. Paradoxically, in many examples of genetic modification, through their actions anti-GM campaigners have shot themselves in the foot and driven some of the technology into the hands of ever-larger companies. Only these firms can afford the excessive, expensive and needless regulatory processes that must be repeated in every country due to the lack of internationally accepted standards. Subsistence farmers and starving children are the collateral victims. In the case of golden rice, there is no giant corporate conspiracy – merely a desire by motivated scientists to address global health issues within a framework of subsistence farming. Mr Goldsmith is trying to resurrect a debate that might have had currency 15 years ago but which is no longer relevant in scientific or socioeconomic terms. Were he to look at the evidence, he might embrace technology for the contribution it can make to producing food that is healthier for humans and for the environment."
"Most news coverage of the wildfires raging in California, Washington and Oregon on American TV channels made no mention of the connection between the historic fires and climate crisis, according to a new analysis from Media Matters Reviewing coverage aired over the 5-8 September holiday weekend, the progressive media watchdog group found that only 15% of corporate TV news segments on the fires mentioned the climate crisis. A separate analysis found that during the entire month of August only 4% of broadcast news wildfire coverage mentioned climate crisis.  Wildfires are raging in states across the American west, burning record acreage in California, Washington and Oregon. The wave of fires was first sparked and stoked by a spate of unusual weather in August, including rare lightning storms that hit parts of California that were vulnerable to fire because drought and heat had dried out vegetation. The fires came before low-elevation, coastal parts of the state reached peak fire season in the autumn when fierce offshore winds have driven the biggest fires in recent years. The fires that hit Oregon in recent days were stoked by dry conditions and rare easterly winds. Although untangling the weather conditions from climate crisis is complicated, it’s clear that overall, in recent years “fire risk is increasing dramatically because of climate change”, said Chris Field, who directs the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. Global heating has given rise to drier, hotter conditions and more frequent, extreme droughts that have left the landscape tinder-dry and prone to explosive blazes. Although California’s landscape has long been prone to fire, climate crisis has “put pressure on the entire system”, Field said, throwing it out of balance and giving rise to more extreme, catastrophic events. The current fires expanding with such explosive force have burned more acreage within a few weeks than what has burned in previous years. A consensus of research has made clear that extreme heat and drought fueled by global heating has left the American west tinder-dry and especially vulnerable to runaway fires. A 2019 study found that from 1972 to 2018, California saw a five-fold increase in the areas that burned annually. Another study estimates that without human-caused climate crisis, the area that burned between 1984 and 2015 would have been half of what it actually was. And a research paper published last month suggests that the number of autumn days with “extreme fire weather” – when the risk of wildfires is extremely high – has more than doubled over the past two decades. “Our climate model analyses suggest that continued climate change will further amplify the number of days with extreme fire weather by the end of this century,” the researchers write, “though a pathway consistent with the UN Paris commitments would substantially curb that increase.” Climate crisis is not the only factor driving the barrage of blazes across the region. Ironically, a century of suppressing fires – extinguishing the natural, necessary fires in western forests and other wildlands to protect homes and timber – has led to an accumulation of fire-fueling vegetation. “A deficit of fire, concatenated with the effects of climate change have led us here,” said Don Hankins, a fire ecologist at California State University, Chico. Media Matters singled out two TV news journalists who are regularly talking about the role of climate crisis: the CBS meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli and NBC’s Al Roker.  The Media Matters analysis also noted that so far, 2020 has been the third year in a row during which corporate broadcast TV news discussed the impacts of climate crisis in fewer than 5% of wildfire segments."
"While attention was focused on Covid-19, a spike in death rates in the UK during the second week of August slipped past almost unnoticed. At least 300 more died than average. This excess exactly coincided with a heatwave, when temperatures in the south of England exceeded 33C (91F) for almost a week but more importantly resulted in “tropical” nights in urban areas, defined as exceeding 20C (68F). Scientists have long warned that summer heat is a serious danger to older people, plus the obese and those with heart and lung diseases – often the same underlying health conditions that can turn Covid into a dangerous illness.  The death toll from heatwaves has been rising this century across the world, not just in the UK. Excess day and particularly night-time temperatures make it impossible for the body to cool down as it needs to, sometimes placing intolerable burdens on vital organs. Heat has become the silent killer. In the last century in Britain many poor pensioners died from cold each winter because they could not afford to heat their poorly insulated homes, with the government introducing an annual £200 heating allowance to stave off hypothermia. So far, apart from heatwave warnings, there is little action to provide cool places where the vulnerable might seek refuge. "

Aren’t All That Influential?

We have been led to believe that we can control the size of the ozone hole and both methane and CO2 concentrations with our emissions.
We have also been led to believe we control weather patterns (storminess, droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes); we control tropospheric, atmospheric, surface, and deep ocean temperatures; we control glacier retreat and advance; we control relative sea level; we control whether or not over million species go extinct by 2050 . . . all by emitting more or less gaseous substances in our pursuit of energy and comfort.
What if we are overestimating our impact on the planet?  What if our gaseous emissions don’t really have anywhere near the impact we think they do?
What if we are too arrogant to even consider the possibility that the Earth cannot be “saved” by building more wind turbines and solar panels and recycling more plastic?
“We’re so self-important. Everybody’s going to save something now. ‘Save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, save those snails.’ And the greatest arrogance of all: save the planet. Save the planet – we don’t even know how to take care of ourselves yet.”
“The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar flares, sun spots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles … hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids and meteors, worldwide floods, tidal waves, worldwide fires, erosion, cosmic rays, recurring ice ages … And we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference? The planet isn’t going anywhere. WE are!”  — George Carlin

NASA: Montreal Protocol Not Responsible For Ozone Changes – Natural Meteorology Is

NASA Reveals New Results From Inside the Ozone Hole
“NASA scientists have revealed the inner workings of the ozone hole that forms annually over Antarctica and found that declining chlorine in the stratosphere [from reduced human emissions] has not yet caused a recovery of the ozone hole. …. [T]wo new studies show that signs of recovery are not yet present, and that temperature and winds are still driving any annual changes in ozone hole size. … The classic metrics create the impression that the ozone hole has improved as a result of the Montreal protocol. In reality, meteorology was responsible for the increased ozone and resulting smaller hole, as ozone-depleting substances that year were still elevated. The study has been submitted to the journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.
“‘Ozone holes with smaller areas and a larger total amount of ozone are not necessarily evidence of recovery attributable to the expected chlorine decline,’ said Susan Strahan of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.”

Most Of The Measured Change In Ozone Is Natural, Not Anthropogenic

Hess et al., 2015
“[A] large portion of the measured change [in ozone] is not due to changes in [anthropogenic] emissions, but can be traced to changes in large-scale modes of ozone variability. This emphasizes the difficulty in the attribution of ozone changes, and the importance of natural variability in understanding the trends and variability of ozone.
Introduction: “Lin et al. (2014) attribute decadal changes in the interannual Mauna Loa ozone record to shifts in circulation patterns. However, at other locations, ozone exhibits considerable interannual variability on decadal timescales that has not been adequately explained (e.g., Koumoutsaris et al., 2008). In many cases, this ozone variability is not easily ascribed to changes in emissions. For example, changes in emissions do not explain the baseline ozone trends at Mace Head, Ireland (e.g., Hess and Zbinden, 2013; Fiore et al., 2009), measured as strongly positive during the most of the 1990s but since leveling off (Carslaw, 2005; Derwent et al., 2007, 2013; Simmonds et al., 2004). In an analysis of ozone trends over Europe, Wilson et al. (2012) conclude that the impact of European precursor emission reductions was masked by other sources of unknown ozone variability. Analyses by Logan et al. (2012) and Cui et al. (2011) show that the measured ozone increases at Alpine sites over Europe during the 1990s followed by decreases after 2000 are not easily explained by changes in emissions or changes in lower stratospheric ozone. Pozzoli et al. (2011) conclude that changes in meteorology and natural emissions account for 75 % of ozone variability from 1980 to 2005, largely masking changes in anthropogenic emissions. On decadal timescales, ozone trends can depend sensitively on the exact time period examined (Cui et al., 2011).”

“Recent research has demonstrated that the concentrations of anthropogenic halocarbons have decreased in response to the worldwide phaseout of ozone depleting substances. Yet, in 2015 the Antarctic ozone hole reached a historical record daily average size in October. Model simulations with specified dynamics and temperatures based on a reanalysis suggested that the record size was likely due to the eruption of Calbuco, but did not allow for fully-coupled dynamical or thermal feedbacks. We present simulations of the impact of the 2015 Calbuco eruption on the stratosphere using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with interactive dynamics and temperatures. Comparisons of the interactive and specified dynamics simulations indicate that chemical ozone depletion due to volcanic aerosols played a key role in establishing the record-sized ozone hole of October 2015. The analysis of an ensemble of interactive simulations with and without volcanic aerosols suggests that the forced response to the eruption of Calbuco was an increase in the size of the ozone hole by 4.5 million km2.”

Due To Measurement Uncertainties, ‘Methane Emissions Might Not Have Increased Dramatically…After All’

Turner et al., 2017
“We conclude that the current surface observing system does not allow unambiguous attribution of the decadal trends in methane without robust constraints on OH variability, which currently rely purely on methyl chloroform data and its uncertain emissions estimates.”
[press release]
“[M]ethane emissions might not have increased dramatically in 2007 after all. Instead, the most likely explanation has less to do with methane emissions and more to do with changes in the availability of the hydroxyl (OH) radical, which breaks down methane in the atmosphere. As such, the amount of hydroxyl in the atmosphere governs the amount of methane. If global levels of hydroxyl decrease, global methane concentrations will increase — even if methane emissions remain constant, the researchers say. … When atmospheric concentrations of methane increase, it may not be correct to chalk it up solely to an increase in methane emissions“

Recent Methane Rise ‘Biogenic’ – Fossil Fuel Emissions Not A Driving Factor

Nisbet et al., 2016
“The isotopic evidence presented here suggests that the methane rise [2007-2014] was dominated by significant increases in biogenic methane emissions, particularly in the tropics, for example, from expansion of tropical wetlands in years with strongly positive rainfall anomalies or emissions from increased agricultural sources such as ruminants and rice paddies. Changes in the removal rate of methane by the OH radical have not been seen in other tracers of atmospheric chemistry and do not appear to explain short-term variations in methane. Fossil fuel emissions may also have grown, but the sustained shift to more 13C-depleted values and its significant interannual variability, and the tropical and Southern Hemisphere loci of post-2007 growth, both indicate that fossil fuel emissions have not been the dominant factor driving the increase. A major cause of increased tropical wetland and tropical agricultural methane emissions, the likely major contributors to growth, may be their responses to meteorological change.”

IPCC Estimates Of Methane Emissions Overestimated, Not Distinguishable From Natural Background

Ruppel and Kessler, 2017
“On the contemporary Earth, gas hydrate is dissociating in specific terrains in response to post-LGM [last glacial maximum] climate change and probably also due to warming since the onset of the Industrial Age. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive proof that the released methane is entering the atmosphere at a level that is detectable against the background of ~555 Tg yr−1 CH4 emissions. The IPCC estimates are not based on direct measurements of methane fluxes from dissociating gas hydrates, and many numerical models adopt simplifications that do not fully account for sinks, the actual distribution of gas hydrates, or other factors, resulting in probable overestimation of emissions to the ocean-atmosphere system.”

The Domination Of Natural CO2 Emissions

Carey et al., 2017
“While scientists and policy experts debate the impacts of global warming, Earth’s soil is releasing roughly nine times more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than all human activities combined.”

Reich et al., 2016
“Plant respiration results in an annual flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere that is six times as large as that due to the emissions from fossil fuel burning, so changes in either will impact future climate.”

Zimmerman et al., 1982
“The estimated gross amount of CO2 produced [by termites] is more than twice the net global input from fossil fuel combustion.  As we noted above, termites process the  equivalent of about 28 percent of the earth’s NPP [net primary productivity, or plant energy].”

Harde, 2017
“The anthropogenic contribution to the actual CO2 concentration is found to be 4.3%, [and] its fraction to the CO2 increase over the Industrial Era is 15%“

Munshi, 2015
“[R]esults do not indicate a measurable year to year effect of annual anthropogenic emissions on the annual rate of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s rush into green energies is slowly and grudgingly being acknowledged by once steadfast proponents as a failure. Over time, even the most bitter of realities have to be accepted.
Germany’s online Tagesspiegel here recently presented a commentary on the collapse of the country’s largest solar components manufacturer, Solarworld, and what it really means.
First let’s note that the Tagesspiegel is based in Berlin, and is a center-left publication, and so what we have here is a grudging admission from a proponent that the pet green energy project is not what many would like us to believe it is.
Recently the top brass of Solarworld announced it would declare insolvency, and has since become “a case where we can learn a lot,” so says Tagesspiegel’s Ursula Weidenfeld.
She writes: “It tells us the story of megalomania, ignorance, cockiness and blindness of the future” and that it is an example of “the state interfering with competition  – and distorting it” to the point where “companies are hampered and the power of innovation is weakened”

Weidenfeld compares the German government’s forays into green energy to the refugee crisis, where good intentions ended up with disastrous results. On companies feeding at the subsidy trough, she writes:
Ultimately, they wind up resorting to tricks, then they disappear.”
Weidenfeld describes a Germany that was hell-bent on showing the world how things are supposed to get done, but in the end wound up as an embarrassing failure. Weidenfeld concludes on the massive solar subsidies:
The more that politics tries to shape entire [industry] branches, the faster they come to an end. It’s for sure: the German initiatives are exemplary for the world. Here we can learn what you don’t do.”
Trump may not be able to stop the mass green energy subsidy scheme Paris is demanding, but the natural laws of economics certainly will. The longer the scheme is propped up, the bigger the crash will be.

This ridiculous claim made me think of this line:
Sometimes, number one, you just have to bow to the absurd – Jean Luc Picard, Star Trek TNG
From RAW Story and the Tabloid Climatology department:
In a column on Tuesday, environmental blogger Robert Scribbler noted that the Northern Hemisphere Jet Stream had merged with the Southern Hemisphere Jet Stream.
“It’s the very picture of weather weirding due to climate change. Something that would absolutely not happen in a normal world,” he wrote. “Something, that if it continues, basically threatens seasonal integrity.”
“Like many extreme events resulting from human-forced climate change — this co-mingling of upper level airs from one Hemisphere with another is pretty fracking strange,” Scribbler explained. “Historically, the Tropics — which produce the tallest and thickest air mass in the world — have served as a mostly impenetrable barrier to upper level winds moving from one Hemisphere to another. But as the Poles have warmed due to human-forced climate change, the Hemispherical Jet Streams have moved out of the Middle Latitudes more and more. ”
“That’s bad news for seasonality,” he continued. “You get this weather-destabilizing and extreme weather generating mixing of seasons that is all part of a very difficult to deal with ‘Death of Winter’ type scenario.”
University of Ottawa climate scientist Paul Beckwith called the new behavior“unprecedented.”
“Our climate system behaviour continues to behave in new and scary ways that we have never anticipated, or seen before,” Beckwith observed. “Welcome to climate chaos. We must declare a global climate emergency.”
In a YouTube video, Beckwith said that the jet stream behavior signaled “massive hits to the food supply” and “massive geopolitical unrest.”

Umm, the tropics are an “impenetrable barrier”? Riiiight. OK have a look at Beckwith’s deer in the headlights video:

I like the “impenetrable barrier” line…as if everything in the atmosphere is somehow fixed and rigid. It reminds me of the sort of thinking that said we’d never get into the stratosphere. Even in recent times, we have been told that the stratosphere is a “barrier” to the mixing of air.
http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469(1996)053%3C0905:RWPSAM%3E2.0.CO%3B2

Beckwith Scribbler may have borrowed that “impenetrable barrier” phrase from a  recent story about the Van Allen radiation belts.
http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-impenetrable-barrier-earth-02302.html

BTW Paul Beckwith is one of the founders of the Arctic Methane Emergency Group (AMEG) and so when I pointed out that studies have shown no methane emergency, he obviously needed to find a new emergency.
See: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/06/22/new-agu-study-negates-the-climate-methane-emergency-in-alaska/
and
https://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/08/19/the-arctic-methane-emergency-appears-canceled-due-to-methane-eating-bacteria/
Looks like Beckwith has a classic case of Emergency Deprivation Syndrome.
It’s really nothing but:
But, Dr. Roy Spencer really has the last laugh in a story he posted about this yesterday:

“Climate System Scientist” Claims Jet Stream Crossing the Equator is Unprecedented
June 29th, 2016 by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.

Paul Beckwith has a masters degree in laser optics, which he has somehow parlayed into being a “Climate System Scientist” to spread alarmism about the climate system.
But his post “Unprecedented, Jet Stream Crosses Equator” suggests he knows little of meteorology, let alone climate.
A “jet stream” in the usual sense of the word is caused by the thermal wind, which cannot exist at the equator because there is no Coriolis force. To the extent that there is cross-equator flow at jet stream levels, it is usually from air flowing out of deep convective rain systems. That outflow often enters the subtropical jet stream, which is part of the average Hadley Cell circulation.

There is frequently cross-equatorial flow at jet stream altitudes, and that flow can connect up with a subtropical jet stream. But it has always happened, and always will happen, with or without the help of humans. Sometimes the flows connect up with each other and make it look like a larger flow structure is causing the jet stream to flow from one hemisphere to the other, but it’s in no way unprecedented.
We’ve really only known about jet streams since around WWII…one of my professors, Reid Bryson, was one of the first to advise the U.S. military that bombers flying to Japan might encounter strong head winds. The idea that something we have been observing for only several decades on a routine basis (upper tropospheric winds in the tropics) would exhibit “unprecedented” behavior is rather silly.
I especially like this portion of Paul’s post:
“We must declare a global climate emergency. Please consider a donation to support my work..”
Nice touch, Mr. Beckwith.

About 10 minutes after publication this post was updated to correctly attribute a quote to Robert Scribbler, and the “tabloid climatology” graphic was added. – Anthony
UPDATE: Joe Bastardi adds this via email
In 1975 (or 1976) we had a cold front ( from the south) cross the equator.  I remember people flipping out about that, the awe of it, not that it was some kind of magical sign of impending doom. In any case that is even more impressive to see a trough from the south push so much to deliver such an event.
Here is the article reference in the journal:
http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0477(1976)057%3C1435%3AASHCFP%3E2.0.CO%3B2
Here is the 1957 version:
http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/092/mwr-092-11-0513.pdf
UPDATE2:
The normally pro-AGW Capital Weather Gang calls this claim “utter nonsense”.
Ryan Maue, a senior meteorologist with a doctoral degree who works at WeatherBell Analytics, agreed with Mass that the cross-equator flow is totally normal and not evidence of a joint hemispheric jet stream. “Cross-equatorial flow at both upper and lower levels is part of the seasonal transition of the Western Pacific monsoon through boreal summer,” he said.
To be clear, the hypothesis that global warming is destabilizing the polar jet stream is a legitimate idea that has been published in peer-reviewed journals, though it remains controversial. But even the scientist who developed the hypothesis, Jennifer Francis, a professor of meteorology at Rutgers University, suggested it had been misapplied by Scribbler and Beckwith. “I’d say cross-equator flow cannot be unprecedented, maybe not even all that unusual,” she said.
…
Such information viewed through the lens of a non-specialist may come across as both credible and alarming but damages the reputation of the science when ultimately shown to be flawed.
“This fear-mongering helps no one,” Maue said.
UPDATE3: (7/3/16)
Even Michael Mann says the claim is bunk.

America needs lots of clean, low‐​cost, secure electricity. Unfortunately, renewable sources don’t fill the bill, and a national requirement wouldn’t change things. 



Renewables (excluding hydroelectric dams) produce less than 3% of U.S. electricity, much of which is hardly clean. About two‐​thirds comes from burning scrap vegetation (“biomass”) and garbage, which produce the same pollutants and carbon as coal. The real job is to produce fewer of them, rather than changing fuels from fossilized to non‐​fossilized vegetation.



Geology limits geothermal opportunities, biomass is environmentally questionable, and solar remains prohibitively expensive. That leaves wind power, but efficient wind turbines pollute in their own way taller than the Statue of Liberty and maddeningly noisy. A national requirement would engender the same environmental resistance as conventional generators and transmission. Opposition to California’s requirement is so strong that today, it gets a smaller percentage of power from renewables than in 2001.



Wind generates only when it is blowing, and it blows least when power is most valuable. At peak demand hours in 2006, wind plants in both California and Texas produced below 3% of their potential. To maintain reliability will require continued investment in full‐​scale backup generation. Wind generation is itself expensive even at today’s fuel prices, it requires a massive federal tax credit to survive.



A national policy that creates jobs in renewables destroys them elsewhere. Forcing people and businesses to buy expensive power leaves them less to spend on other goods and investments in future productivity. If unemployment is a national problem, attack it with a national policy rather than special‐​interest legislation for the renewables industry.



That industry is already big enough worldwide that a U.S. requirement is not needed to bring forth better renewable technologies. And renewables don’t matter for national security or energy independence; these are about oil, which produces about 2% of our electricity.



If pollution and climate change are problems, attack them directly. Don’t confuse this special‐​interest legislation with an efficient solution to them.

"If the government doesn’t get its act together soon, then Cop26, the UN climate change conference due to be held in Glasgow in November next year, could become a national humiliation for the UK and an environmental catastrophe for the rest of humanity. One likes to imagine that the UK government is taking the climate emergency seriously, but that illusion has been shattered by the appointment of the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as a UK trade adviser. Abbott has described global heating as “absolute crap”. One of his first actions after becoming prime minister of Australia was to abolish his own climate change advisory council, followed by a decision to scrap Australia’s carbon tax.  Global heating is starting to run out of control. At a time when the need for concerted international action is greater than ever, the international community is failing to reduce its carbon emissions. The Kyoto protocol was designed to curb global emissions of all greenhouse gases, but annual emissions have actually risen by more than 60% globally compared with 1990, the baseline year for the protocol. More carbon has been emitted as a result of human activity since 1990 than in all previous years since the start of the industrial revolution. By any standards, the Kyoto protocol has proven a spectacular failure, but the fault cannot be laid entirely at the door of the UN. The main obstacles to progress have been the reluctance of fossil-fuel-dependent nations to change their business model, and the cynical strategy of disinformation launched by the fossil fuel industry, and secretly funded free-market thinktanks, notably the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Cop26 is probably our last opportunity to turn this situation around, but it won’t happen without a set of game-changing proposals from the organisers. Probably the most critical measure would be to introduce an effective global carbon tax. At the moment we have carbon trading schemes, but these are just a market mechanism for purchasing the right to emit carbon. It is cheaper for industry to pay for its emissions than to invest in greener technologies. The most fair and equitable method of introducing a carbon tax is to set up a global carbon incentive fund, and to levy the tax on countries whose per capita emissions of carbon dioxide are above the global average. The fund would then disperse grants to countries whose per capita emissions are below the global average. The beauty of this scheme is that it penalises the richer nations for their profligate lifestyles, and it incentivises developing nations to avoid fossil fuels and to develop their energy infrastructure using low-carbon technologies. For this strategy to work the price needs to be set at the right level initially, and then escalated rapidly. The UN has determined that carbon emissions have to fall by 7.6% each year over the coming decade if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C. The current carbon price on the European emissions trading system is just under €30 per tonne of carbon dioxide, so one proposal would be to set the starting price at $30, and then double the price every two years. If that were introduced in 2022, the price would be $240 per tonne of CO2 by 2028. Before the fossil fuel industry emits ritual howls of protest, it needs to be remembered that Sweden already operates with a carbon tax of $123 per tonne of CO2, while the cost of air pollution to society, according to the IMF, is $140 per tonne of CO2.  The calculation for the amount of carbon needs to be made on the basis of consumption, not production. Many countries export a large volume of manufactured goods, so their territorial emissions are high, whereas the end consumer is based in another country. China, India and Russia, which together represent 40% of all carbon emissions, would benefit from using consumer-based emissions, whereas the US would lose out, but not as much as would the UK. At $30 per tonne, the UK’s contribution would be more than three times larger: $7bn versus $2bn, reflecting the demise of the UK’s manufacturing base. However this is still less than half of the annual budget of the former Department for International Development. In addition, the UK started the industrial revolution and would have been responsible for virtually 100% of global carbon emissions in 1750. It is therefore entirely appropriate for the UK to lead the world in demanding a consumption-based carbon tax. Calculating the figures should be straightforward, as the Global Carbon Project already produces annual consumption estimates. However, it does have limitations. The Global Carbon Project does not include other greenhouse gas emissions, and more importantly it does not estimate carbon dioxide emitted by changes in land use, such as deforestation, crop-burning, ploughing and so on. So there needs to be a supplementary tax that penalises environmentally irresponsible governments such as Brazil’s, which seems to regard trashing the planet as a political accolade. The solutions are clear, but as host nation, Britain is in desperate need of a leader with vision and determination. The question is: can anybody identify anyone in Boris Johnson’s cabinet who might have the political will to carry this forward? • Robin Russell-Jones is chair of Help Rescue the Planet and scientific adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution"

 _Viv Forbes BScApp, FAusImm, FSIA  
_



In their frantic attempts to delay the spread of the Wuhan virus, governments are sowing the seeds of economic depression and currency destruction, which will blight Australian lives for a generation. They are adding financial stress to medical stress.



The ordinary flu virus kills many people every winter despite vaccines. And both viruses are more lethal for the old and the sick.



We do not close the whole country every flu season but this year’s crisis is being exploited by scaremongers, centralists and globalists whose slogan is “never let a decent crisis go to waste”.



Whole industries are being destroyed before our eyes – airlines, shipping, the whole tourism and entertainment industry, sport, small business, pubs and clubs and most investment and retirement funds. All sacrificed because governments fear that a sharp spike in illnesses will expose inadequacies in the government-managed hospital/health/welfare bureaucracy. Next, they will exploit this economic crisis to promote digital currency, kill cash and get their sticky fingers on our superannuation assets.



Already the green globalists are celebrating as industry emissions fall and political power moves towards central governments and global organisations. They will now abuse this economic crisis by pushing their climate agenda with stimulus packages that favour green energy.



As this government-created economic cyclone destroys industry and jobs, politicians are panicking and scattering cash like confetti at a wedding. This encourages immediate consumption, but this “stimulation” stops dead when the money tap is turned off. The debts will remain, somewhere.



We don’t want more sit-down-money from big government while we hide forlornly at home ordering takeaways – we want conditions which encourage investment and productive employment.



We need measures to encourage the creation of new businesses, industries and jobs. For starters, immediate repeal of payroll taxes, stamp duty, capital gains tax, wage controls, a rates holiday and reduced income tax. And the immediate and permanent repeal of all green barriers to new business and jobs.



We need Australians building new dams, railways, roads, real power stations, factories, farms, forests and mines, not sitting sadly at home fearing ration coupons and being drip-fed on some piddling new allowance.

"Nominations for the 89th Academy Awards will be announced on Tuesday, and movie marketers will be ready to pounce with ads that try to coax more people into seats: The establishment is swooning! Get to a theater! It works. Research indicates that Oscar nominations often result in tens of millions in additional ticket sales, particularly for     films. Among the movies counting on awards attention to find a bigger audience is “Moonlight. ” Seen as a leading contender for best picture, this euphorically reviewed drama about a young black man in Miami started strong but has stalled. It has taken in about $15. 8 million over 14 weeks. For “Silence,” Martin Scorsese and Paramount desperately need the academy to help their   drama from becoming a financial washout. Costing $50 million to make, “Silence,” a passion project for Mr. Scorsese as director, has collected $5. 2 million since its arrival on Dec. 23. “Lion,” a   set largely in India, is a Weinstein Company film that has earned $16. 4 million  —   a solid result for an art film of its type but still a long way from Weinstein awards hits in recent years. (Another Weinstein movie, “The Founder,” about the start of the McDonald’s   empire, arrived to $3. 4 million in ticket sales over the weekend.) “20th Century Women,” a comedic drama about a quirky mother (Annette Bening) in the late 1970s, has taken in $2. 3 million. An Oscar nomination for Ms. Bening would help give it momentum. As for the weekend, “Split,” the latest thriller from M. Night Shyamalan and Blumhouse Productions, was the No. 1 movie in North America. Expertly marketed by Universal Pictures, which leaned on   digital promotions, “Split” sold an estimated $40. 2 million in tickets, far surpassing prerelease analyst expectations. “Split” cost just $9 million to make, with Mr. Shyamalan personally footing the bill. Arriving as a distant second was “XXX: The Return of Xander Cage” (Paramount) which managed roughly $20 million  —   an underwhelming start for a film that cost at least $125 million to make and market and was designed to revive an action series that had been dormant for 12 years. Instead, “The Return of Xander Cage,” starring Vin Diesel, who tried to rally his 101 million Facebook followers, will likely become more evidence that Americans have little appetite for movie franchises that have been on ice for more than a few years. (See: “Independence Day: Resurgence” and “Zoolander 2. ”) Paramount, which offset its financial risk by bringing in partners, said the film collected an additional $50. 5 million in partial release overseas and called it “the No. 1 movie in the world. ” Rounding out the top three, “Hidden Figures” (20th Century Fox) continued to ride strong word of mouth, taking in roughly $16. 3 million, for a   domestic total of $84. 2 million, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data."
"The Somali pirates have nothing on the bunch who turned up in Copenhagen, seeking to plunder the world and divvy up the loot under the guise of ‘saving the planet’. I heard even Mugabe was there, after reducing his nation from rich Rhodesia to poor Zimbabwe, looking for a handout under the latest fable, ‘the Carbon Debt’ supposedly owed to the poor countries by the rich countries.
There is only one carbon debt, and that is the debt every inhabitant of this planet owes to carbon dioxide. Without adequate amounts of this in the atmosphere, plant life suffocates, and we could not grow enough crops to feed the population. To quote Freeman Dyson ‘The fundamental reason why carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is critically important to biology is that there is so little of it. A field of corn growing in full sunlight in the middle of the day uses up all of the carbon dioxide within a metre of the ground in about five minutes’.
Surely it’s time to confront the immorality of scaring children witless with images of ‘threatened bears’ (polar and koala) and ‘dying’ reefs and then exploiting their fears with cheap political stunts.
Please, no more scares and no more talkfests, whether in Mexico in 2010, or Cairns in 2011 (neither city has reported snow yet). The money would be better spent on improved and reliable water, power and transport systems. Education about how this country became prosperous would also be a good investment into a prosperous future otherwise we can descend from A to Z (Australia to Zimbabwe) faster than in a Mad Max movie.

While the nation’s southern region has been cooking for weeks, no one except the local sufferers seem to have taken much notice. But that’s about to change. Mr. Heat has landed in Washington, D.C.



Any weather anomaly in our nation’s capital acquires cosmic significance. A heavy snowstorm in January, 1996 made the cover _Newsweek_ , which blamed global warming. It was world news when three big snowstorms hit in the winter of 2009-10. Climate alarmists again said they were caused by pernicious economic activity. Flatliners said they were evidence of global cooling … and so it goes.



The National Weather Service is currently forecasting 103 degrees for Friday with a dewpoint of 72, which gives a “heat index” (a rough measure of physiological heat stress) of 116, hard into the “danger zone” for prolonged exposure or strenuous physical activity. As of now, that looks like the crest of this heatwave.



The cynics among us will point out that this is really pretty much a garden‐​variety peak‐​of‐​summer hot spell, and yes, we brought it upon ourselves by building dreaded cities, and that it has been much worse before “climate change” ever became an epithet. Further, what we are seeing is minor, weenie, dinky — compared to the great eastern heatwave of July and August 1930.



To see the real magnitude of the heat, check out the 1930 temperatures far away from DC’s urban core. Down at McCormick Observatory in Charlottesville, which has several hundred feet of elevation on Washington (and therefore should be a couple of degrees cooler), the daily highs, beginning on July 19, were 103, 107, 106, 105, 97, 92, 102, 104, 93, 103, 106, 90, 95, 91, 97, 101, 106, 102, 90, 100, 99, 105 and 98.



DC’s residents poured out of their ovens and set up quarters on the Mall and in Rock Creek Park. Minnesota congressman Charles Davis died of heatstroke. About half of Virginia’s counties reported shortages of drinking water. Baptisms were suspended. 30 rattlesnakes ravaged a farm in Michigan, attacking turkeys for their blood. 300,000 acres of forest combusted in Virginia (the current annual average is around 10,000). Smoke + sunlight = ozone, making the air in 1930 truly vile.



Downtown, the _Washington Post_ maintained an accurate thermometer in a newspaper kiosk, where the shade temperatures reached 110 on July 20 and August 9. Reasonably assuming a 72 degree dewpoint yields a heat index of 124. But Washington has warmed further since then from its urban heat island, so a downtown temperature/​heat index of 113 and 127 would likely occur today under the meteorological conditions of 1930. About these nosebleed temperatures we’re suffering in the Distric, almost all of Washington’s summer warming is due to the city itself rather than to global change — summer high temperatures in nearby rural Virginia show no significant trend whatsoever.



I have noted in previous columns that heat‐​related deaths are indeed declining in every large U.S. urban area with the exception of cool Seattle. As urban heat becomes common, we adapt.



But there’s one scary aspect: we are now dependent upon air conditioning. It used to be that the first heatwaves of summer produced disproportionate mortality, and then, as people got used to the heat, a similar warm spell killed fewer. We have probably lost some of our ability to acclimate because of our technology.



Loss of air conditioning creates big problems, this proven in the great Midwestern heatwave of 1995 (when the heat index reached a deadly 136 in southern Wisconsin). When Chicago bakes, there’s always more mortality on the poorer South Side, where many older buildings lack air conditioning. In 1995, that wasn’t the case, as a dry thunderstorm knocked out power early in the heatwave in the air‐​conditioned North Side, spreading mortality equally on both sides of the city.



Both extremely hot and cold temperatures stress our electrical grid to the breaking point, and there is precious little in reserve. Frigid winds in 1994 caused rolling brownouts in the East. A major power catastrophe was narrowly averted in 1999 when a brief but very intense heat pulse fortunately occurred on the Fourth of July. What will happen on the East Coast when the weather of 1930 repeats itself, as it surely will?



We simply haven’t tested our power supply under such conditions, and we really don’t have an infrastructure that can cope with such an event. While current heat in the eastern U.S. shouldn’t cause any major power problems, it will certainly be used to draw Washington’s attention to climate change. Perhaps we should be worrying instead about our electricity supply. Meanwhile, a repetition of 1930 awaits.

"Everyone can contribute to scientific research, whether by exploring far-flung galaxies from the comfort of their computer, or by checking how clean the air is in their street by examining lichens growing on trees. Although “ordinary people” have been participating in scientific research for hundreds of years, the number of such citizen science projects in the last decade has dramatically increased. Now millions of people around the world are engaged in citizen science. It is a huge development in the way scientific research is conducted, and how scientists and the public interact. Environmental questions such as how species interact with their environment, how plants and animals are responding to changing climates, and the spread of pests and diseases, are especially suited to a citizen science approach as it allows large amounts of data to be collected over wide geographical areas. A particularly topical citizen science project is the OPAL Tree Health Survey. OPAL is a nationwide programme, supported by the Big Lottery Fund, which aims to engage people with their local environment through participation in surveys. One focuses on the pests and diseases that affect trees - you can’t have missed reading about ash dieback, the disease caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, which infects the tree and causes leaves to turn black and branches to die.  Fungal spores are carried on the wind, and the sale and transport of infected trees also spreads the disease. Ash trees on continental Europe have been badly affected, with reports of Denmark losing between 60-90% of its ash trees. The ash is an important part of the British landscape, and is widely used in making furniture and wooden tools due to it’s attractive grain and flexibility. Ash canopy is less dense than many other native trees, allowing a wide range of invertebrates and mammals to thrive beneath. It’s often planted as part of hedgerows, and around 5% of British woodlands are ash-dominated, so loss of the species would have a significant impact on the landscape. Since the appearance of the fungus in Britain in 2012, Forestry Commission and Fera staff have checked trees for signs of the disease, and have found 563 confirmed incidences of the disease. This is likely to be only scratching the surface, but the departments simply don’t have enough staff to survey further. That’s where the OPAL Tree Health survey comes in. Researchers at the University of York, Plymouth University, Imperial College London, Fera and Forest Research have drawn up guides to show people how to go out and check the health of trees. The survey focuses on ash, oak, and horse chestnut trees, lists the common pests and diseases that affect them, and more serious threats such as Chalara and the oak processionary moth.  Surveying woodland for these pests and diseases is important because records of where they are (and where they aren’t) are important for helping to manage their spread. So far over 1,000 people from all across the UK have returned results from the OPAL Tree Health survey. Citizen science projects such as this are sometimes criticised because of concerns about the quality of data. Some scientists are sceptical that members of the public can collect data reliably. OPAL tries to improve data quality in several ways. The identification guides are designed to be as simple as possible, and are tested with members of the public to ensure that they are. OPAL trains group leaders such as teachers, environmental educators, foresters and members of voluntary organisations to demonstrate how to conduct the survey. They also teach key identification features of the pests and diseases. Those that have been trained have since gone on to train others, but there are also online materials for those who have not attended a training course. Lastly, OPAL encourages people to submit photographs of any pests and diseases that they find, which allows scientists to verify sightings. Citizen science projects can benefit scientists and participants in many ways, and at the same time generate valuable scientific data. Participants can gain a better understanding of science, and by engaging with the public scientists can improve their skills at communicating their findings.  If you’d like to take part in the survey then just download the materials and get started - before the trees near you start losing their leaves."
"**The UK could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to citizenship if China does not suspend plans for a security law in the territory, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says.**
The law, making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority, prompted fears Hong Kong's unique status could end.
China said it reserved the right to take ""counter-measures"" against the UK.
There are 2.9m people in Hong Kong eligible for the passport.
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the UK and China had agreed that holders of British National (Overseas) - or BNO - passports should not enjoy UK residency.
""All such BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals and if the UK insists on changing this practice it will not only violate its own stance but also international law,"" he added.
There are 300,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who already have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa.
But the Home Office confirmed that the proposed new rights, allowing those eligible to spend 12 months in the UK without a visa, could be offered to anyone with BNO status as long as they applied for and were granted the passport - opening it up to 2.9m Hong Kong residents.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""deeply concerned"" at China's proposals for legislation related to national security in Hong Kong.
In a statement, she said: ""If China imposes this law, we will explore options to allow British Nationals Overseas to apply for leave to stay in the UK, including a path to citizenship.
""We will continue to defend the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.""
Mr Raab's statement came after the UK, US, Australia and Canada issued joint condemnation of Beijing's plan, saying imposing the security law would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" framework agreed before Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
The framework guaranteed Hong Kong some autonomy and afforded rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China.
It comes as US President Donald Trump described the Chinese government's plans in Hong Kong as a ""tragedy"", and announced he would start to end preferential US treatment for the city in trade and travel.
China has rejected foreign criticism of the proposed law, which could be in force as early as the end of June.
Li Zhanshu, chairman of the parliamentary committee that will now draft the law, said it was ""in line with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots"".
British National (Overseas) passports were issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before the transfer of the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Announcing the possible change in policy, Mr Raab said the six-month limit on stays in the UK for BNO holders would be scrapped.
""If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will remove that six month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,"" he said.
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says that Beijing might not mind if some pro-democracy campaigners escape to the UK, but the flight of talented wealth creators would be of concern.
Some MPs want the UK to go further and offer automatic citizenship. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said BNO holders should have an automatic right to live and work in the UK.
The government has in the past rejected calls to give BNO holders in Hong Kong full citizenship.
Last year more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong signed a petition calling for full rights. The government responded by saying that only UK citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK and cited a 2007 review which said giving BNO holders full citizenship would be a breach of the agreement under which the UK handed Hong Kong back to China.
However in 1972 the UK offered asylum to some 30,000 Ugandan Asians with British Overseas passports after the then-military ruler Idi Amin ordered about 60,000 Asians to leave. At the time some MPs said India should take responsibility for the refugees, but Prime Minister Edward Heath said the UK had a duty to accept them.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy earlier said the UK had to be more robust with Beijing.
Referring to the security law, she told the BBC: ""This is the latest in a series of attempts by China to start to erode the joint declaration which Britain co-signed with the Chinese government when we handed over Hong Kong, and protected its special status.""
""We want to see the UK government really step up now,"" she said.
Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK should bring together a coalition of countries to avoid a tragedy in the territory.
He told the BBC: ""This is definitely the most dangerous period there has ever been in terms of that agreement.
""With our unique legal situation, Britain does have a responsibility now to pull together that international coalition and to do what we can to protect the people of Hong Kong.""
On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""We are deeply concerned about China's legislation related to national security in Hong Kong.
""We have been very clear that the security legislation risks undermining the principle of one country, two systems.
""We are in close contact with our international partners on this and the Foreign Secretary spoke to US Secretary [Mike] Pompeo last night.""
He added: ""The steps taken by the Chinese government place the Joint Declaration under direct threat and do undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.""
On Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have ""a high degree of autonomy"" from mainland China.
This could lead to Hong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status."
"Badgers in the UK are an important wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis, a disease that leads to the slaughter of thousands of cattle each year at a significant cost to the tax payer. But the badger cull that has taken place, and looks set to continue, is playing into one of the complexities of badgers’ lives that has made tackling the disease difficult. As part of our research I fitted proximity-logging collars to 51 badgers to follow them during their day-to-day social lives. By tracking their movements we could investigate whether an individuals’ infection with TB influenced their lives, and those of fellow badgers. These state-of-the-art devices track the animals’ location, and record the interactions of animals wearing them when they come within a pre-defined distance of each other, in our case 64cm - about a badger-length. The first part of the study, published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, showed that badgers that strayed away from their social groups’ main burrow (known as a sett) in favour of sleeping in outlying setts were more likely to carry TB. Taking this a step further, our subsequent article published in Current Biology showed how these patterns of movement within the sett are related to interactions among badgers within their social group, but also between those from different groups. We found that badgers infected with TB were less well connected with their own social groups compared to those that were uninfected. These infected badgers were more prone to form social links with badgers from other groups, and this is what facilitates the transmission of TB infection across badger populations. For all sorts of epidemics in wildlife and in humans, such as the common cold, some individuals are known to behave in a particular way that makes them more likely to spread or contract the disease. It’s been acknowledged for some time that individual badger behaviour is likely to be a key factor in how the disease spreads and is transmitted to livestock. The evidence that this research has provided underpins previous observations of the counter-productive effects of culling. Professor Robbie McDonald who supervised this work alongside others at the University of Exeter and AHVLA’s National Wildlife Management Centre, refers to infected badgers in this system as “spread capacitors”. In a similar fashion to the electronic capacitor, they are passive components that are able to hold and discharge infection, but tend to stabilise rates. In contrast, a badger that is highly socially mobile acts as a “super spreader”, infecting others disproportionately because of their high social connectedness in the network. In another aspect of the study, led by our collaborator Dr Julian Drewe from the Royal Veterinary College, the proximity-logging collars were also fitted to cattle gazing near to the woodland where the same collared badgers lived. This revealed that direct contact between badgers and cattle on pasture in Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire (an area with a fairly high density badger population that has been intensively studied) was relatively rare despite ample opportunity. However, indirect visits by both species to badger latrines (a single point outside the burrow where badgers, tidy animals, keep their droppings) were significantly more common. This suggests that it is these and perhaps other indirect contact away from pasture, for example in farm buildings, that is the common route of TB transmission. Taken together these findings suggest that efforts to manage the spread of tuberculosis are likely to be most effective when badgers’ social structure is maintained. The “peturbation effect” evidenced by disturbances such as culling, may break down badgers’ social groups. This leads badgers, including infected individuals, to scatter and perhaps further spread infection. With that in mind it is badger vaccination that may have the best chance of disrupting the flow of the disease, without disturbing the badgers’ networks and risking further, more widespread infection."
"

Here we all are in week two of an event that is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Our country closed down by the Government and everyone quarantined at home.



While the Prime Minister claims that putting us under an effective state of house arrest is the only way to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus and prevent “tens of thousands of New Zealand deaths”, many questions remain about the way this crisis is being handled.



First some perspective.



During every winter’s influenza [epidemic](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/112942493/kiwis-underestimate-the-seriousness-of-the-flu-says-public-health-professor), around a million New Zealanders become infected with highly contagious flu viruses. Upwards of 500 people die. The very young and very old are most at risk, as well as those with pre-existing medical conditions. Although our hospitals can be overwhelmed, for most of us life continues without too much disruption.



The difference between this COVID-19 outbreak and the flu is, of course, the fact that there are vaccines for influenza. While they may not always be a perfect match with the particular strain of flu prevailing at the time, they nevertheless help to create widespread immunity.



Any potential mis-match is due to timing. The decision on the content of a vaccine has to be made in October to allow 5 to 6 month for the manufacture of the 1.5 million doses New Zealand needs by March. While it’s based on the dominant strains of influenza in the northern hemisphere winter, by the time the viruses make their way to New Zealand for our winter, they may have mutated so even those who have been vaccinated may be vulnerable to some of the strains in circulation. 



Individuals become immune to a virus when they develop antibodies either naturally through exposure or a vaccine. When enough people can no longer transmit an infectious virus, the disease will die out and the population will have gained what is known as ‘herd immunity’.



Pandemics like COVID-19 occur when there is no herd immunity and no vaccine. It’s similar to the situation in 2003 when another new coronavirus – Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS – emerged from China.



Following that pandemic, the Ministry of Health produced a [plan](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/communicable-disease-control-manual/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-sars) for dealing with such outbreaks. It required all contacts to be tracked and anyone not needing hospital care to “be isolated at home or in some other suitable facility throughout the period of communicability”.



Household members were to be relocated away from anyone infected. If that was not possible, they were to minimise contact, with daily follow up by public health officials to determine whether symptoms develop.



Since COVID-19 is the same virus family as SARS, questions must be asked as to why such a plan was not enacted once the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 12 March?



More specifically, why did the Government decide not to isolate the [ten](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases/covid-19-current-cases-details) cases in New Zealand at the time?



By isolating infected people, Singapore was not only able to contain the virus without putting others at risk, but they also avoided the need to shut their entire economy down.



Meanwhile, new research emerging from around the world suggests that the virus is not as dangerous as originally thought. Once the high incidence of asymptomatic cases had been [factored](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20022434v2) in, the fatality rate of Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan drops to between 0.04 percent and 0.12 percent – lower than the seasonal flu at 0.1 percent.



Oxford University researchers [found](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-half-uk-population-oxford-university-study-finds-a4396721.html) that fewer than one in a thousand people infected with COVID-19 becomes sick enough to need hospitalisation. The vast majority have only mild symptoms or none at all. Their assessment of the fatality rate for the virus in the UK is around 0.002 percent, far lower than the seasonal flu.



Many specialists are also beginning to [conclude](https://www.globalresearch.ca/swiss-doctor-covid-19/5707642) that pre-existing diseases may be a more important factor than the virus itself, with 99 percent of the patients in Italy, who tested positive for the virus and died having had one or more pre-existing conditions.



German immunologist and toxicologist Professor Stefan Hockertz concurs, explaining that most so-called ‘corona deaths’ have in fact died of other causes while also testing positive for the virus. He believes up to ten times more people than reported are infected, but show no or few symptoms. Professor Hockertz says, “Covid-19 is no more dangerous than influenza, but is simply observed much more closely. More dangerous than the virus is the fear and panic created by the media and the ‘authoritarian reaction’ of many governments.”



Northwestern University’s Professor Charles Manski, who has analysed government responses to the virus, [explains](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/covid-19-policy-must-take-all-impacts-into-account/), “Two fundamental strategies are possible: mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread – reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection; and suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely.”



He warns about the risk when governments choose ‘suppression’, saying that the epidemiological modelling upon which such approaches are based, does not quantify “the enormous social and economic costs which have a significant impact on health and well-being in the short and longer-term.”



Singapore is a country that has chosen mitigation as its policy approach, but so too has Sweden. It has adopted a far more liberal [strategy](https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2020-03/coronavirus-schweden-stockholm-oeffentliches-leben/komplettansicht).



Sweden has not closed its borders nor its schools. Neither has it closed non-essential businesses. Even the ski slopes are continuing to operate. Skiers are asked to keep their distance while queuing at the lifts – and in restaurants – but otherwise, it’s business as usual.



This response is based on their philosophy of “trusting the public to adopt voluntary measures to delay the spread of the virus”.



Along with a common sense approach to hygiene and social distancing, the Swedish strategy is based on two principles: firstly, at-risk groups must be protected by requiring older people and those with underlying health problems to remain isolated, and secondly, anyone with flu symptoms must stay at home.



In comparison, here in New Zealand, the lockdown policy imposed by Jacinda Ardern’s Government, which is crippling our economy, is based on suppression.



Their decision was informed by modelling produced by Otago University, which included a doomsday scenario. That [report](https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/report_for_chief_science_advisor_-_health_-_24_march_final.pdf), Potential Worse Case Health Impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic for New Zealand if Eradication Fails, states: 



“In this worse case scenario the epidemic would be expected to peak in early July 2020. A total of 3.32 million New Zealanders would be expected to get symptomatic illness; 146,000 would be sick enough to require hospital admission; 36,600 would be sick enough to require critical care; and 27,600 would be expected to die. This death toll would far exceed the death toll for NZ from World War One (18,000 deaths) and from the 1918 influenza pandemic (9000 deaths). Not considered here also are all the deaths from people who don’t receive normal care (eg, for heart attacks) due to re-orientation of the health system to deal with COVID-19.”



Their [modelling](https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/report_for_moh_-_covid-19_pandemic_nz_final.pdf) indicates restrictions may need to be in place for 6 months, 9 months, or the ‘rest of year’ to reduce ‘peak’ hospital demand. It concludes, “If New Zealand fails with its current eradication strategy toward COVID-19, then health outcomes for New Zealand could be very severe. If interventions were intense enough however, in some scenarios the epidemic peak could still be suppressed or pushed out to the following year (at which time a vaccine may be available).”



Just as the Government’s zero carbon policies are based on apocalyptic climate models that don’t take into account real-life evidence, has Jacinda Ardern fallen into the same trap with COVID-19?



The Prime Minister has called for national unity in dealing with the virus pandemic: everyone working together. And largely, that’s what people are doing.



She also wanted an end to political point scoring during the emergency, accusing National’s leader Simon Bridges of politicising the crisis whenever he challenged the Government’s coronavirus strategy.



But while National MPs and candidates have now put electioneering on hold for the duration of the crisis, Labour has been [publishing](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2020/03/labour_politicising_the_pandemic.html) taxpayer funded adverts promoting their ‘success’ in handling the pandemic.



In fact, politics appears to underlie many of the Government’s recent decisions.



Isn’t that why billions of dollars of the business support package were targeted at beneficiaries through a permanent $25 a week increase in benefits and a doubling of the winter energy payment?



Isn’t it why landlords were attacked just before the lockdown through a rent freeze and a ban on evicting dangerous tenants?



Isn’t it why an additional $56 million in race-based funding was given to Maori on top of all of the other support being provided to New Zealanders? 



And isn’t it why the Police and Jacinda Ardern have turned a blind eye to the vigilante road blocks set up by tribal activists around the country?



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, freelance writer Michael Coote, has been [outraged](https://www.nzcpr.com/covid-19-pretext-for-sweeping-maori-tribal-territorial-claims/) by the actions of politicians, police and councils in condoning these illegal blockades:



“The roadblocks are mendaciously represented as precautionary COVID-19 sanitary cordons imposed at alleged tribal borders, yet patently have a political function as Trojan horses for Maori racial supremacists to claim control of contemporary internal borders at which other people can be stopped and prevented from entry just like sovereign states. The COVID-19 blockades are actually crude assertions of Maori tribal sovereignty. COVID-19 will eventually pass as an issue, but the precedent that Maoris can arbitrarily prevent people from lawful passage and freedom of movement throughout New Zealand will linger unless central government takes a stand…



“Maori rahuis have no legal force. The current ‘road rahui’ Maoris are private interests who have no legal right to block public roads, impede lawful passage, or stop, obstruct, interrogate, and turn back travelers, or otherwise impair access to public or private land, apart from land they themselves own. People promoting and implementing illegal public road blockades should be subject to swift official interventions such as warnings, arrest and removal, and court prosecution by authorities such as Police and local and central government.” 



That our Government is not only condoning vigilante border patrols in blatant breach of a country-wide lockdown – but also the effective establishment of tribal sovereignty – is indeed a constitutional outrage. How can this be acceptable under any circumstances?



More importantly, what is the Prime Minister going to do about it?



Without a doubt, these are troubling times. New Zealand’s COVID-19 cases continue to grow and tragically we have had our first death. While for now we are all stuck in our “bubbles”, questions remain about what happens next?



Will the Government’s commitment to their models mean we will be forced to stay in home detention for longer than the four weeks they indicated? Or will they allow the economy to start rebuilding, while recommending that at-risk groups continue to protect themselves until a vaccine is available?



Professor Michael Osterholm, the director of the US Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who has been researching options for re-starting an economy after a lockdown, has [observed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/) that there was hardly any difference in the rate of transmission of the COVID-19 virus between Hong Kong, which closed its schools, and Singapore, which didn’t.



So, if New Zealand schools could re-open at the end of the 28-day lockdown, then family members would be able to work, paving the way for our recovery to begin.



Professor Osterholm suggests: “The best alternative will probably entail letting those at low risk for serious disease continue to work, keep business and manufacturing operating, and ‘run’ society, while at the same time advising higher-risk individuals to protect themselves through physical distancing and ramping up our health-care capacity as aggressively as possible. With this battle plan, we could gradually build up immunity without destroying the financial structure on which our lives are based…”



That sounds like a pretty sensible plan for New Zealand too.

"**The US mass protests are raising eyebrows around the world, but China is watching with particular interest.**
As anti-racism protests sweep across the US, Beijing has seized upon them to hit back at Washington for supporting last year's Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations.
Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability.
Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US.
China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as ""Pelosi's beautiful landscape"" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were ""a beautiful sight to behold"".
State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can ""enjoy this sight from their own windows"".
Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for ""glorifying violence"" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as ""rioters showing signs of terrorism"".
Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events.
""Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals,"" she says.
Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying ""double standards"" in its response to civil unrest.
""You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted,"" said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam.
""And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then.""
The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America ""the double standard nation"".
Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy.
In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests.
Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented.
""It's powerful, because they are not making it up,"" Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US.
China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media.
On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests.
Ms Kokas says: ""Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principle of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.""
The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems ""very hollow""ï¼she adds, ""when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC"".
The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader.
Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help.
Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US.
The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted ""I can't breathe"", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong.
But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included ""all lives matter"", a phrase often used to undermine the ""black lives matter"" movement.
Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.
Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some ""misunderstandings"".
One Weibo user expresses ""disappointment"", as the person sees ""some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted"".
China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region.
There's no doubt US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views.
Many Weibo posts ""congratulate"" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations.
One user writes: ""The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!""
And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a ""black hand"" behind the unrest.
As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China.
Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as ""karma"" for Washington.
But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation.
""This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment,"" a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes.
Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. ""Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results,"" a comment reads.
Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country.
One Weibo user writes about being ""envious of the freedom of expression"" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China.
Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication.
But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism.
State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a ""pro-America"" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo.
Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship.
Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites.
""The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space,"" she says.

From the College Fix:
Professors tell students: Drop class if you dispute man-made climate change
‘We will not, at any time, debate the science of climate change’
Three professors co-teaching an online course called “Medical Humanities in the Digital Age” at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs recently told their students via email that man-made climate change is not open for debate, and those who think otherwise have no place in their course.
“The point of departure for this course is based on the scientific premise that human induced climate change is valid and occurring. We will not, at any time, debate the science of climate change, nor will the ‘other side’ of the climate change debate be taught or discussed in this course,” states the email, a copy of which was provided to The College Fix by a student in the course.
Signed by the course’s professors Rebecca Laroche, Wendy Haggren and Eileen Skahill, it was sent after several students expressed concern for their success in the course after watching the first online lecture about the impacts of climate change.
“Opening up a debate that 98% of climate scientists unequivocally agree to be a non-debate would detract from the central concerns of environment and health addressed in this course,” the professors’ email continued.
“… If you believe this premise to be an issue for you, we respectfully ask that you do not take this course, as there are options within the Humanities program for face to face this semester and online next.”
More here: http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/28825/
Just look at these people. The class is taught by professors in Genetic engineering, English (with old cooking recipe collections), and Sociology/Social Justice.

Brilliant minds, all, which probably explains why they couldn’t even get the much regurgitated 97% consensus correct, and instead say 98%.

[CHECK OUT OUR PLANS](https://thebfd.co.nz/subscription-plans/?ref=1 ""Get your BFD on!"")

"In a few years, you could be eating the next generation of genetically altered foods  —   potatoes that do not turn brown or soybeans with a healthier mix of fatty acids. And you may have no idea that something is different, because there may be no mention on the labeling even after a law passed by Congress last year to disclose genetically modified ingredients takes effect. A new generation of crops known as   rather than genetically modified is coming to the market. Created through new tools that snip and tweak DNA at precise locations, they, at least for now, largely fall outside of current regulations. Unlike older methods of engineering genes, these techniques, like Crispr, so far have generally not been used to add genes from other organisms into the plants. The federal Agriculture Department has asked companies to advise it of their plans. But once the companies submit data to show the agency that the gene edits do not introduce foreign genes from plant pests into the crops, the agency is giving businesses the green light. Hundreds of acres of   crops have already been grown in several states, unencumbered by oversight or regulations. And a few people have eaten them already. “This is not Frankenfood,” said André Choulika, chief executive of Cellectis, one of the companies developing   crops. In October, Cellectis hosted a dinner at Benoit New York, the Alain Ducasse Manhattan restaurant, and served dishes made from its   soybeans and potatoes. Guests included professors, journalists and celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris, the actor. “I don’t even know what gene editing is,” Mr. Harris said. “I thought we were supposed to wear jeans. ” Calyxt, a subsidiary of Cellectis doing the   food, is also developing new versions of wheat including one with greater resistance to fungal diseases, another lower in carbohydrates and higher in dietary fibers. Other companies also developing   crops including DuPont Pioneer, which has used the technology for a new variety of waxy corn, used most commonly not for food but for starch in adhesives. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University have used Crispr to create mushrooms that do not turn brown as quickly. The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms, where scientists used bacteria and viruses  —   typically from plant pests  —   to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plant’s DNA. That worked, but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted, and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with  . M. O. crops. Companies like Calyxt have portrayed gene editing more like moving the cursor in a word processor to a particular location and making a small change to the text. Federal agencies have not yet said how they intend to regulate   foods, and the incoming Trump administration, while criticizing overregulation in general, has not weighed in. Other parts of the world are also considering whether to regulate   foods and how to do so. In Europe, where many countries have banned the cultivation of G. M. O. s, the European Commission has created a scientific panel to study the issue, with debate resuming this year. Dr. Choulika said the inspiration for the October gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier, by   Parmentier, a French scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to Europe from South America. But many Europeans scorned the potato. France even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748. Largely because of Parmentier’s work, potatoes were declared to be safely edible in 1772, and the ban was lifted. Still, few wanted to eat them. In 1778, Parmentier organized the first in a series of lavish dinners for the high society of Paris, serving dishes all made with potatoes. Potatoes became a fixture in French cuisine. With farmers harvesting the first substantial plantings of the Cellectis   potatoes and soybeans last year, Dr. Choulika thought of throwing a modern version of Parmentier’s gathering. “This is the first dinner on Earth with   foods,” Dr. Choulika said to the diners. “Things that you eat today, millions of people are going to eat during the 21st century, and this will not stop. ” Food is a side business for Cellectis, which focuses on pharmaceuticals. After some collaborations with big companies like Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer, Cellectis started Calyxt, to explore opportunities for using gene editing for foods. Dr. Choulika said he considered G. M. O.s safe, but that the   techniques like those used by Calyxt would be more acceptable to consumers. Often in G. M. O. s, the inserted genes came from unrelated species, like the bacterial genes that were added to cotton so that it would exude a toxin to repel bollworms, a mixing of species known as transgenesis. “There’s not this blockage of transgenesis that freaks out people for no reason,” he said. “I think it is a question of perception. ” Instead of using bacteria and viruses to burrow into a cell,   techniques  —   Calyxt uses one called Talen  —   create molecules that act as a template to match a specific segment of DNA and then make a cut there. For the Calyxt soybeans, for example, the only change was to turn off two genes. “There is nothing taken out or added to the plant,” Dr. Choulika said. “It’s what nature would have produced. ” Those edits change the mix of fatty acids and perhaps make for a better cooking oil. “Better than olive oil,” Dr. Choulika said. At the dinner, the soybeans were transformed into a several dishes including soy blinis, mini tofu and soy burgers, and soybean hummus. Carole Pourchet, director of the Lab, the research and development arm of Mr. Ducasse’s food enterprise, said the   soy cooked like normal soy, but that the potatoes were a little drier, leading to the idea to confit them to retain moisture. The potatoes showed up in mashed potatoes, potato pie and blinis. “The dinner was maybe potatoes cooked 10 ways,” said Richard C. Mulligan, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who was one of the guests. Dr. Choulika worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mulligan’s laboratory two decades ago. Federico Tripodi, chief executive of the Calyxt subsidiary, said the company hoped the soybeans would be used in cooking oil for commercial and industrial use by 2018. The potatoes, edited to remain fresher longer and not produce carcinogens when fried, could be grown and sold in 2019. A second potato that is slower to turn brown just got word from the U. S. D. A. that it, too, is not subject to regulation. Gene editing is not being used only with plants. A Minnesota company, Recombinetics, is editing the genes of farm animals  —   for example, creating cattle without horns. Critics warned that the industry was repeating the same mistakes of G. M. O. s. “We’ve never been against any of this technology,” said Michael K. Hansen, a senior staff scientist at Consumers Union. “We don’t say it’s inherently bad or these crops are inherently dangers. It’s just they raise safety issues, and there should be required safety assessments. ” While the   templates match a specific sequence, it is possible that the same sequence occurs elsewhere in the genome or they will match similar sequences, and the DNA will be sliced in those places, too, with unknown consequences. “They make it sound very exact,” Dr. Hansen said. “It will have   effects. ” Dr. Hansen said unregulated   crops could also create trade havoc if traces of them accidentally mixed into exports to countries that prohibited them. Daniel Voytas, chief science officer of Calyxt who was one of the inventors of the Talen   technology, said the company had not checked the entire genomes of their plants, but did look for unintended changes within sections that were similar to the parts they were editing. “We didn’t find any,” he said. Dr. Voytas said it would not be “a huge amount of work” to sequence the entire genome and that all of the data they presented was available on the U. S. D. A.’s website. A U. S. D. A. advisory board in November unanimously recommended that standards for organic foods exclude   crops even if they were grown without chemical fertilizers and abided by the other strictures of organic farming. Dr. Mulligan of Harvard said he was not sure that people would see much difference between   and genetically modified. “The objection that people have is a more visceral and vague objection to messing with DNA,” he said. “It’s hard to see that the public would see the difference. ” He admitted that he was more excited by the chef. “The good thing with this is Ducasse is such a culinary artist,” Dr. Mulligan said. “He is really well known for being able to take anything and make it taste good. ” For Mr. Harris, the dinner provided a whirlwind introduction to biotechnology  —   “realities that I thought were theoreticals,” he said."
"British scientists have mapped cavities half the size of the Grand Canyon that are allowing warm ocean water to erode the vast Thwaites glacier in the Antarctic, accelerating the rise of sea levels across the world. Like decay in a tooth, the channels of warm water are melting the ice from below, threatening the stability of a glacier that is larger than Great Britain.  Using an aircraft, ship and robot submarine, the British Antarctic Survey and a US team traced the seabed terrain and the bottom of the ice shelf to measure the gaps that have opened between previously grounded sections of the glacier. They measured two old cavities that were roughly six miles (10km) across and 800 metres deep, which allow warm water to seep under the ice. These have formed over at least 10,000 years. In addition, they mapped several new, thinner fissures that have branched off from these main trunks amid the warmer temperatures of the past 30 years. The results were published this week in the Cryosphere journal. The good news is the new channels are not yet as large as had previously been assumed, which suggests the collapse of Thwaites may not come as soon as feared. The bad news is scientists believe the cavities are widening but they do not know how fast. “Before we did these studies, the assumption was that all the channels are the same, but the new ones are much thinner and more dynamic. They will get bigger over time,” said one of the lead authors, Tom Jordan, an aerogeophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey. “Understanding that process and how these cavities evolve will be key to understanding how Thwaites and western Antarctica will change in the future.” That is one of the most important questions in the world today. The paper notes that Thwaites glacier covers 74,000 sq miles (192,000 sq km), and is particularly susceptible to climate change. Over the past 30 years, ice loss from Thwaites and its neighbouring glaciers has increased more than fivefold, accounting for more than 4% of global sea-level rise. If the glacier collapses completely, it would add another 25in (65cm). Many scientists believe this process is already under way but the speed of collapse remains unknown. The new study is part of an attempt to assess those risks by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. “We are only halfway through the process so these are interim statistics,” Jordan said. “Intuitively, it would seem that the new thin cavities will let in less warm water so the collapse of the glacier would be slower than previously believed, but that needs to be confirmed. This data should be included in future models.” There have been some discussions about geoengineering to block the flow of warm water, but Jordan said this would be expensive in such a remote region. Instead, he called for a reduction in emissions as the most cost-effective way of easing climate impacts. “Theoretically, we could build a dam to stop the hot water coming in. But these channels are ridiculously large. We can intervene more cheaply by reducing carbon dioxide,” he said."

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was the largest overhaul of the federal income tax in decades. The law changed deductions, exemptions, and tax rates for individuals, while reducing taxes on businesses.



More than 86 percent of middle‐ and higher‐​income households received an individual tax cut.1 Most lower‐​income households do not pay income taxes, but many of them received increased benefits from refundable credits. The average benefit across all households in 2018 is $1,260.2



This report looks at changes to individual income taxes, particularly the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The 2017 tax law cut individual tax rates and roughly doubled standard deductions, but it also imposed a $10,000 cap per return on SALT deductions. Those changes are expected to reduce the number of households that deduct state and local income, sales, and property taxes from 42 million in 2017 to 17 million in 2018.3



Millions of households will feel a larger bite from state and local taxes and will thus become more sensitive to tax differences between the states. The tax law may prompt an outflow of mainly higher‐​earning households from higher‐​tax states to lower‐​tax states.



Even before the new tax law, a substantial number of Americans were moving from higher‐​tax to lower‐​tax states. Looking at migration flows between the states in 2016, almost 600,000 people with aggregate income of $33 billion moved, on net, from the 25 highest‐​tax states to the 25 lowest‐​tax states in that single year.



Interstate migration flows are influenced by many factors, including retirement, job opportunities, housing costs, and climate. Experts disagree about how large a role taxes play in migration, but that role will certainly be increased by the new tax law.



The raw data suggest that taxes do influence migration. Of the 25 highest‐​tax states, 24 of them had net out‐​migration in 2016. Of the 25 lowest‐​tax states, 17 had net in‐​migration. The largest out‐​migration is from high‐​tax New York, whereas the largest in‐​migration is to low‐​tax Florida. Florida is enjoying an influx of wealthy entrepreneurs and retirees looking for a tax climate that boasts no income tax or estate tax.



The following sections discuss changes to the SALT deduction and examine trends in interstate migration. Then, the report looks at the relationship between taxes and migration. The out‐​migration of high earners is a serious threat to high‐​tax states because those individuals pay a large share of state income taxes, invest in new businesses and generate jobs, and are heavily engaged in philanthropy.



In this new era of intensified tax competition, state policymakers should rethink their tax codes with an eye toward retaining and attracting residents. They should improve the efficiency of government services to give taxpayers more value for their money. And they should reduce regulations on individuals and businesses, given that Americans are migrating, on net, to states that provide more economic freedom.



Before the passage of the 2017 tax law, individuals had no direct limit on the amount of state and local taxes they could deduct on their federal returns.4 The deduction was available to households that itemized deductions, which in 2017 was 27 percent of tax filers. The other 73 percent took the standard deduction.5 Of households that itemized, 93 percent took the SALT deduction.



The effect of the SALT deduction was to soften the blow of state and local income, property, and sales taxes. For example, taxpayers in New York in the 33 percent federal bracket in 2017 who paid $30,000 in state and local income and property taxes could reduce their federal taxes by $10,000. The federal government essentially gave them a rebate of that amount.



Meanwhile, high-income taxpayers in California subject to the 39.6 percent federal tax rate and a state rate of 13.3 percent effectively faced just an 8.0 percent state rate because of federal deductibility. The higher the household’s income, the larger the effective federal subsidy.



The 2017 tax law changed that. Most higher-income taxpayers will now face the full brunt of state and local taxes—the full $30,000 cost in New York and the full 13.3 percent rate in California.



Before the law change, federal deductibility subsidized high-tax states and encouraged them to load their taxes onto higher earners. The SALT deduction induced “shifting of the jurisdiction’s tax burden to those individuals best positioned to receive the federal tax subsidy,” which were high earners because they were generally the ones who itemized.6



Taxes are the “price” residents pay for state and local services such as police and schools, but the SALT deduction effectively reduced that price, thus inducing residents to demand too much spending. The Congressional Budget Office noted of the SALT deduction, “Because of the subsidy, too many of those services may be supplied, and state and local governments may be bigger as a result.”7



The prior SALT deduction mainly benefited higher earners. Before the law change, 91 percent of the benefit went to households with incomes above $100,000.8 The deduction favored higher-income and higher-tax states over other states. In California, 96 percent of state and local deductions that exceeded $10,000 were taken by households with incomes above $100,000.9



The new SALT limit is a long-needed reform. Leading up to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Reagan administration proposed eliminating the deduction, with President Reagan arguing, “Perhaps if the high-tax states didn’t have this federal crutch to prop up their big spending, they might have to cut taxes to stay competitive.”10 The 1986 law did eliminate the deductibility of sales taxes, but Congress added back that deduction in 2004.



The 2017 law capped the SALT deduction at $10,000 per year, for both single and married tax filers. It also nearly doubled standard deductions. Those changes will reduce the number taking the SALT deduction from 42 million in 2017 to 17 million in 2018.11 For people who continue to take it, the average benefit will be less than half as large. The $10,000 cap is not adjusted for inflation.



The full weight of state and local taxes will now be felt by an additional 25 million households. The states where SALT deductions were the largest relative to incomes were New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Minnesota.12 Those are generally high-tax states.



Governments in high-tax states are worried that the SALT reform will induce additional high-earning taxpayers to move out. If they move in substantial numbers, it would be a blow to state budgets. In New York, the top 1 percent of highest earners pay 41 percent of state income taxes; in New Jersey, the share is 37 percent.13 In California, the top 1 percent pay a remarkable 50 percent of state income taxes.14



Under the new federal law, some states are becoming more cautious about raising taxes. New Jersey’s legislature passed bills to raise taxes on millionaires five times under former governor Chris Christie. Christie vetoed them. But now that New Jersey has a governor eager to raise taxes on millionaires, the legislature has shied away. State Senate President Steve Sweeney (D), who previously supported higher taxes, earlier this year cautioned, “This state is taxed out” and the federal tax law “changed the game for us.”15 But in July, Sweeney caved, agreeing with the governor to raise the top individual income tax rate from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent.



To shield themselves from the SALT changes, some states are considering converting part of their mainly nondeductible income taxes into deductible employer payroll taxes. Other states are trying to convert state tax payments into charitable contributions, which continue to be fully deductible. New York has enacted limited versions of those mechanisms, but the schemes may not be effective or pass muster under federal tax law. The U.S. Treasury has issued a notice saying that it will be imposing regulations.



A more productive response to the federal tax changes would be for high-tax states to reduce their tax rates so that people have less incentive to migrate. State policymakers should use federal tax reform as an opportunity to rethink their state budgets to ensure that residents receive high-value services at minimum cost.



Will more people in higher-tax states move to lower-tax states under the new federal tax law? The next section looks at current migration trends to provide some clues.



This report examines interstate migration data produced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).16 The IRS flags when a tax filer’s address changes and has built a database aggregating moves in and out of every county and state. The database includes each tax filer’s adjusted gross income (AGI).



The IRS data show that 2.8 percent of tax filers—essentially households—moved between states in 2016. Tax-filing households may be either singles or married couples, with or without children. An average household comprises 2.1 people in the IRS data.17



The IRS data do not include households that do not file tax returns, so it misses about 13 percent of the population.18 However, the data are quite precise because they are not based on survey data, as are migration data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau.



Experts agree on the basics of interstate migration.19 The migration rate has dropped since the 1980s, although the IRS data show a smaller drop than the census data.20 The internal migration rate is higher in the United States than in most other high-income countries. Migration rates decline with age. Renters are more likely to move than homeowners. Singles are more likely to move than married couples. Migration is somewhat pro-cyclical.



Table 1, column 1, shows the number of net domestic in-migrants (in-migrants less out-migrants) for each state in 2016, based on the IRS data. All data in this report exclude international immigration and emigration.



New York lost 218,937 households to other states in 2016, gained 142,722 households from other states, and thus had a net loss of 76,215.



The other states with the largest net migration losses were Illinois (41,965 households), New Jersey (25,941), California (25,913), Pennsylvania (19,516), Massachusetts (14,549), Ohio (13,254), Connecticut (12,254), Maryland (12,068), and Michigan (10,325).



Where did those domestic migrants go? The largest net inflows were to Florida (95,072), Washington state (30,480), North Carolina (25,601), Colorado (24,672), Arizona (24,211), Oregon (21,729), Texas (19,414), South Carolina (18,519), Georgia (17,798), and Nevada (14,236).



For nearly all states, the 2016 migration flows represent extended trends. For 48 of the 50 states, the net direction of migration (in or out) in 2016 matched the direction of the total net flows over the past five years. The two states that were different were oil producers Oklahoma and North Dakota, which used to have net in-migration but now have net out-migration. Also note that Texas had abnormally low in-migration in 2016—its net inflows over the past five years have been larger than Florida’s.



For many states, recent trends extend back decades. The largest net migration losers between 1993 and 2010 were New York, California, Illinois, Michigan, and New Jersey. The largest net migration winners over that period were Florida, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, and Georgia.21



Table 1, column 2, shows the ratio of gross in-migration to gross out-migration in 2016. States losing population have ratios of less than 1.0. States gaining population have ratios of more than 1.0. New York’s ratio is 0.65, meaning that for every 100 households that left, only 65 moved in. Florida’s ratio is 1.45, meaning that 145 households moved in for every 100 that left.



 **Table 1: Interstate migration flows, 2016**

The IRS database includes AGI, so we can see how much aggregate income is migrating between the states. The AGI is the income reported in the first year a household is at a new address. Strictly speaking, AGI does not migrate; people do. An individual’s income may be higher or lower after moving to a new state. Nonetheless, saying that income is “migrating” is rough shorthand for saying that the earning power of households is moving between states.22



In 2016, households with $227 billion of income moved between states. Looking at Table 1, column 3, New York lost a net $8.4 billion in income to other states in 2016, whereas Illinois lost $4.8 billion. Florida gained $17.2 billion.



The ratios in column 4 are similar to those in column 2, except that they are ratios of income, not households. Florida’s household ratio is 1.45, and its income ratio is 2.46. The larger income ratio means that in-migrants to Florida have much higher incomes than out-migrants do. Other states with a much higher income ratio than household ratio include Idaho, Montana, South Carolina, Utah, and Wyoming. Those states are attracting large numbers of high-income in-migrants compared with their out-migrants.



When the column 4 ratio is lower than the column 3 ratio, it means that the state has net out-migration particularly of higher-income households. Connecticut is a good example.



Table 2 shows net migration ratios for households headed by persons age 65 and older and for households with incomes of more than $200,000. Some of the places that both seniors and high earners are leaving, on net, are Alaska, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Some of the places that the two groups are moving to, on net, are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Washington State.



 **Table 2: Ratios of in-migrants to out-migrants, seniors and high earners, 2016**

An annual Census Bureau survey asks people who move any distance the main reason for their decision out of 19 choices. The most popular choices in 2017 were “wanted new or better home” (16.0 percent), “to establish own household” (11.5 percent), “other family reason” (11.3 percent), “new job or job transfer” (9.9 percent), and “wanted cheaper housing” (8.3 percent).23



The Census Bureau does not ask movers about taxes. But some of the 19 choices may reflect the influence of taxes. For example, people moving for housing reasons may consider the level of property taxes since those taxes are a standard item listed on housing sale notices. Similarly, people moving for new jobs may consider the effect of income taxes if they are, for example, moving between a high-tax state such as California and a state with no income tax such as Nevada.



A national survey by Bankrate found that taxes play a substantial role in retirement location decisions.24 Based on their survey, Bankrate weighted the location choice factors as follows: cost of living (20 percent), taxes (20 percent), health care quality (15 percent), weather (15 percent), crime (10 percent), cultural vitality (10 percent), and well-being (10 percent). Bankrate found that 47 percent of Americans would consider moving when they retire.



Figure 1 shows that many people are moving from northern states to southern states. Liberal analysts typically attribute that fact to people wanting to live in warmer states. Conservative analysts typically attribute it to people wanting to live in lower-tax states. Looking at the Census Bureau survey data for interstate moves only, of the 19 choices, only 2.2 percent chose “change of climate” as the move reason.25 That is surprisingly low. Apparently, there is more to the popularity of many southern states than just higher temperatures.



 **Figure 1: Interstate migration flows, ratios of in-migrants to out-migrants, 2016**

Americans are moving from higher-tax states to lower-tax states in substantial numbers. That is clear from the raw migration data discussed here.



State and local tax revenues averaged 10.1 percent of personal income in the nation in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.26 Sales taxes were 3.5 percent, property taxes were 3.1 percent, individual income taxes were 2.4 percent, and corporate and other taxes were 1.1 percent. Sales taxes include general sales taxes and selective sales taxes on products such as gasoline, alcohol, and cigarettes.



Which of those taxes might influence individual migration decisions?



Polls have asked Americans their “most disliked” taxes.27 The most disliked state and local tax has long been the property tax. After that, Americans dislike sales taxes and individual income taxes. Other polls have asked which taxes are the least “fair.” Property and various selective sales taxes are often the top responses, followed by individual income and general sales taxes.



Thus, sales, property, and individual income taxes likely have the most influence on migration decisions, as they are the largest state-local taxes and the most disliked. Corporate taxes are less disliked in polls, which is not surprising because they are less visible to the public.



Table 3 shows data for the combined net migration flows for the 25 highest-tax and 25 lowest-tax states. Taxes are measured as state and local sales, property, and individual income taxes as a percentage of state personal income. In 2016, 578,269 people moved from the highest-tax states and the District of Columbia to the lower-tax states, on net. Of the 25 highest-tax states, 24 had net out-migration. Of the 25 lowest-tax states, 17 had net in-migration.



 **Table 3: Net migration from high-tax to low-tax states, 2016**  




 **Source:** Author’s calculations based on Internal Revenue Service data.



The tax gap between the 25 highest and 25 lowest states may not seem large at 2.2 percentage points of income. But many of the largest migration flows are between the states with the very highest and very lowest taxes. The largest outflow state, New York, has a tax burden by this measure of 13.0 percent, whereas the largest inflow state, Florida, has a tax burden of 6.6 percent.



Figure 2 shows the relationship between tax levels and migration ratios. The migration ratios are from Table 1, column 2. The tax variable is the average state and local sales, property, and individual income taxes as a percentage of personal income.28



 **Figure 2: Tax levels and net migration ratios, 2016**  




 **Source:** Author’s calculations based on data from the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Census Bureau.



The figure shows a clear negative relationship between tax levels and migration. On the left, states have lower taxes and net in-migration (a ratio greater than 1.0). On the right, states have higher taxes and net out-migration (a ratio less than 1.0).



There were 17 states that had net in-migration in 2016 (a ratio of more than 1.0). Of those, 17 had a tax burden of less than 8.5 percent.



Of the 26 states with a tax burden of 8.5 percent or greater, 25 of them had net out-migration. The only high-tax state with in-migration was Maine. (The District of Columbia had a migration ratio of 1.0.)



Figure 2 shows a fitted regression line. A simple regression of the migration ratio on the tax variable produces a highly statistically significant fit. The _F_ -statistic (12.1) and _t_ -statistic (3.5) are significant above the 99 percent level. State tax levels and net migration flows are highly correlated.



Here are some patterns in the interstate migration flows:29



One interesting pattern that affects high-tax states across the nation is that the net migration ratio gets worse for older age groups. For example, California’s migration ratio for people age 26–34 is 0.92, but the ratio for age 55–64 is 0.60.30 Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio show this same pattern. It appears that older people with higher incomes and higher taxes are even less willing to move to such states than young people with lower incomes and lower taxes.



Taxes are more likely to influence moves when interstate differences are large—and the differences between the highest- and lowest-tax states _are_ large. The District of Columbia government produces an annual study comparing state and local taxes on hypothetical households at various income levels in the largest city in each state.31 The study includes sales, property, individual income, and automobile taxes.



Table 4 highlights some of the results. Families earning $75,000 a year could save about $5,000 a year by moving from a high-tax city to a low-tax city. Families earning $150,000 could save about $10,000 with such a move.32 Those differences would seem to be large enough to influence some people to move.

People who are thinking about moving can easily learn about state tax differences. Two recent Kiplinger.com stories were “Best States to Move to in 2018 for Lower Taxes” and “The 10 Most Tax-Friendly States in the U.S.”33 Another resource is WalletHub’s “2018’s Tax Burden by State,” which compares income, sales, property, and excise taxes.34



Of course, many other factors influence interstate migration, and those factors are complex and sometimes interrelated. If high taxes in a state buy high-quality services such as good schools, then those services will draw migrants willing to put up with the higher taxes. That said, no clear relationship exists between tax levels and the quality of government services across the states.35 In some states, tax revenues may be used efficiently to pay for quality services that residents and in-migrants want. In other states, tax revenues may be dissipated on high-cost bureaucracies or misallocated to activities that most people do not want.



Presumably, most people consider a combination of factors when moving. A recent CNBC article (“Californians Fed Up with Housing Costs and Taxes Are Fleeing State in Big Numbers”) suggests that high costs for housing, taxes, and gasoline were all pushing people out of California.36 Comparable apartments cost twice as much in Los Angeles as in Las Vegas and Phoenix, and gasoline is a dollar a gallon more expensive in California than in Texas, partly because of taxes.37 Although California is viewed as having perhaps the nicest weather in the nation, it has suffered from domestic out-migration for many years.



Economists have used regression analysis to determine the specific factors that drive interstate migration. However, the research has not come to any clear answers with respect to taxes—numerous studies have found substantial migration effects, but some have not.



Since the 1970s, economist Richard Cebula has been publishing statistical studies that attribute interstate migration flows to a range of factors, including state economic growth, housing costs, taxes, climate, crime rates, and public school spending.38 Cebula has consistently found that income and property tax burdens are statistically significant in explaining interstate migration.



A 2012 study by Cebula and Usha Nair-Reichert, for example, performed regression analyses on the determinants of interstate migration between 2000 and 2008.39 Controlling for state employment growth, unemployment, January temperatures, education spending, and the cost of living, they found that income and property taxes per capita were significant in explaining migration. Their results, they say, confirm the Tiebout hypothesis that people “vote with their feet” and move to jurisdictions offering better fiscal bargains.40



Numerous other statistical studies have found that state and local taxes affect interstate migration, including those by Mark Gius; Yu Hsing; Robert Preuhs; Karen Conway Smith and Andrew Houtenville; David Clark and William Hunter; Antony Davies and John Pulito; and Roger Cohen, Andrew Lai, and Charles Steindel.41



New Jersey increased its top individual income tax rate from 6.37 percent to 8.97 percent in 2004. A statistical study by economists in the state’s Department of Treasury found that the hike induced net out-migration of 80 or more millionaires a year.42 That would be a modest effect, but the drain would add up over time if sustained.



With federal deductibility, the 2004 New Jersey increase of 2.6 percentage points was equivalent to an effective increase of 1.6 percentage points. By comparison, the 2017 tax law ended deductibility for most taxpayers, thus increasing the effective top New Jersey income tax rate by 3.6 percentage points.43 Then in 2018, New Jersey hiked its top individual income tax rate from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent, so we should expect larger outflows in coming years than after 2004.



Economists Cristobal Young and Charles Varner found a smaller effect from the 2004 New Jersey tax increase, and Young and coauthors on other studies have found that taxes have only small effects on the interstate migration of millionaires.44 The authors argue that millionaires are not particularly footloose because they are “embedded” in their communities. That is, they often have social and business dealings in their states that make moving difficult.



In sum, numerous statistical studies have found that taxes affect interstate migration, but some studies have contrary findings. One reason for the mixed findings could be the mechanism of “capitalization.” A tax increase in one jurisdiction may cause an initial out-migration to other jurisdictions. That flow will reduce property values in the tax-increasing jurisdiction and raise property values in other jurisdictions. Those property value changes will ultimately stem the migration flow as the economy enters a new equilibrium. If differences in state taxes are mainly capitalized, then the related migration flows will be mitigated.



Wage adjustments may also offset the migration effects of taxes.45 An income tax increase in a state may cause individuals to out-migrate over time. As that happens, gross wages would rise in the tax-increasing state relative to other states, and that would eventually stem the outflow.



A wide range of policy and amenity differences between states—not just taxes—may be capitalized in asset prices or offset by gross wage differentials. To the extent that those market adjustments occur, migration would decrease.



Nonetheless, migration does happen, as we have seen. State policies, individual preferences, and other factors are always changing, and incentives apparently change enough each year for more than 2 percent of U.S. households to move to a different state.



Households with incomes of more than $200,000 were 5 percent of all interstate movers in 2016, but they accounted for 36 percent of the income of all interstate movers.



The 2017 tax law changed migration incentives for this group. The large gap between New York City’s 12.7 percent top income tax rate and Florida’s 0 percent has been laid bare, as has the gap between California’s 13.3 percent top rate and the 0 percent rate in Texas, Nevada, and Washington State.46



IRS data for 2016 show that the highest interstate migration rates are for households with the very lowest incomes, but that is because most of those households consist of young and often single people. When you look within each particular age category, the migration rate is much greater for high earners than it is for middle-income earners. For example, for people between ages 45 and 54, the migration rate for households with incomes between $50,000 and $200,000 was 1.4 percent, but the rate for households with incomes above $200,000 was 2.1 percent. So the highest earners are relatively mobile.



Another important fact about high earners is that they are more responsive to tax rates in general than are other individuals. Empirical academic studies generally agree that high earners respond more in their working, entrepreneurial, investing, and avoidance activities than do other people.47 So we would expect them to be responsive to interstate tax differences.



High earners are often entrepreneurs, and they may move their businesses and related jobs with them when they migrate. Very wealthy entrepreneurs have been gravitating to Florida, which has no income tax or estate tax, as these examples illustrate:



High-tax states are losing not just the income taxes paid by wealthy entrepreneurs moving out, but sometimes the income taxes paid by the people they employ. The head of Palm Beach County’s Business Development Board says good weather and low taxes have drawn 60 or 70 private equity and hedge fund firms to her city in the past few years.56



Florida cities are aggressively courting wealthy individuals and their businesses from high-tax states. Florida gains not just the initial jobs that move but also incremental jobs added as relocated businesses grow. And Florida’s low taxes are drawing not just U.S. financial firms but also international firms that might otherwise have located in the Northeast.57



Recent articles suggest that the new federal tax law is accelerating moves to Florida. A June _Wall Street Journal_ article quoted a Palm Beach real estate expert as saying there is a boom in wealthy buyers looking to purchase to gain tax residency.58 And a June Bloomberg story said: “Florida’s long-running effort to lure Wall Street hotshots is gaining traction thanks to a provision in the federal tax law that hits residents of high-tax states. . . . That’s because Florida doesn’t have a state income tax and its property taxes are relatively low, whereas the tri-state area has among the highest property taxes in the country. . . . ‘SALT has been the No. 1 theme when we speak with finance companies’ about relocating or opening branch offices in Miami, said Nitin Motwani, a lead developer of a $2 billion skyscraper in Miami.”59



Some entrepreneurs have moved their financial firms out of high-tax California. Hedge fund Universa Investments moved its headquarters from California to Florida in 2014. The firm’s founder, Mark Spitznagel, “cited Miami’s favorable tax policies, emerging financial sector and access to Latin American and European investors as primary reasons for the move. . . . ‘Florida’s business-friendly policies, which are so different from California’s, offer the perfect environment for us as we expand,’ he said.”60



Billionaire investor Ken Fisher moved with his investment firm Fisher Investments from California to the state of Washington in 2011. Fisher has a net worth of more than $3 billion, and his company employs more than 2,000 people. Before the move, Fisher had expressed his frustration with California’s high taxes, and he was looking for a lower-tax location not just for himself but also for his employees.61 Washington has no income tax.



As a zero-income-tax state, Tennessee is also booming. The _Wall Street Journal_ reported in May: “AllianceBernstein Holding LP plans to relocate its headquarters, chief executive and most of its New York staff to Nashville, Tenn., in an attempt to cut costs. . . . In a memo to employees, AllianceBernstein cited lower state, city and property taxes compared with the New York metropolitan area among the reasons for the relocation. Nashville’s affordable cost of living, shorter commutes and ability to draw talent were other factors.”62 The company has about 3,400 employees, and it considered 30 different cities in its search for a new home.



Wealthy professional athletes are responsive to state tax differences. After California hiked its tax rate on millionaires in 2012, golfer Phil Mickelson said that he had to take “drastic action” because of the hike.63 Mickelson moved from California to Texas in 2014. He earns about $60 million a year, so the move would have saved him millions of dollars a year.64 In commenting on Mickelson’s tax situation, golfer Tiger Woods said he himself moved from California to Florida in the 1990s to reduce his tax burden.65



Concern exists about the effect of the 2017 tax law on professional sports.66 Even before the law, statistical research found that teams in low-tax cities outperform teams in high-tax cities because it is easier to recruit top players to the former.67 With the tax law, the United States will become a little more like Europe, where large tax differences between countries drive wealthy athletes, entertainers, and other millionaires to Switzerland.68



In their book _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of States_ , Arthur Laffer and coauthors present data from 1993 to 2010 suggesting that the nine states without income taxes (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming) are a particularly strong draw for high earners.69



Recent IRS data support that view. In 2016, 166,000 interstate migrant households had incomes of more than $200,000, and their aggregate income was $86 billion. In that group, households with income totaling $32 billion moved to the nine states without income taxes. Thus, among those high-income migrants, 37 percent of the income moved to 18 percent of the states.



In 2016, the average in-migration ratio for the nine states with no income tax was 1.13 (Table 1, column 2). But the average ratio for those states in the over $200,000 group is much higher at 1.41 (Table 2, column 3). Thus, the zero-income-tax states are a net migration draw, but they are a particularly strong draw for high earners. The one exception is Alaska.



The average income level within the over $200,000 group can indicate the presence of very high earners. In 2016, the average income of all interstate migrants in that top group was $518,000. But the averages for in-migrants to Wyoming and Florida were $897,000 and $849,000, respectively, which were by far the highest averages among the states. Wyoming and Florida do not have income taxes or estate taxes, and they draw very-high-income migrants.



Some analysts say that high earners hesitate to move out of high-tax states because that is where their business and social relationships are. But New York residents who are sick of paying high taxes can establish a new permanent residence in Florida and continue to undertake business and social activities in New York for part of the year. Generally speaking, they can spend up to 183 days in New York without being a tax resident of that state. They need to carefully document their time and activities in Florida to withstand a challenge by New York tax authorities, but that is a common tax-reduction strategy by high earners.70



When state policymakers think about the taxation of high earners, they should recognize that their states lose more than just income taxes when high earners leave. Many wealthy businesspeople are angel and venture investors. They plow their wealth back into young, growing companies, often in the region where they live. If a state loses wealthy individuals, it may also lose startup and entrepreneurial activities down the road.



The wealthy also make large contributions to health, education, and cultural charities in their states. You can see that pattern in a recent Philanthropia.com report that profiles the largest givers in each state.71 Phil Knight, cofounder of Nike in Oregon, gave $500 million to the Oregon Health and Science University. Phillip Frost, a Florida pharmaceutical billionaire, has given hundreds of millions of dollars to Miami-area health facilities, universities, and art and science museums. Jon Huntsman, founder of a chemical company, gave $175 million to the Huntsman Cancer Center in Utah. Darla Moore, a partner in the investment firm Rainwater Inc., has donated tens of millions of dollars to education and arts institutions in her state of South Carolina.



Individuals gave $280 billion to charity in 2016, and foundations gave $58 billion.72 The top 1 percent of earners make one-third of the nation’s charitable contributions.73 The wealthiest 1.4 percent of Americans give 86 percent of all charitable donations made at death.74 If high-tax states lose wealthy individuals to lower-tax states, they will likely lose a share of their state’s philanthropy.



A New Jersey report prompted by the possible loss of charitable giving because of taxpayer flight noted: “Wealthy households contribute disproportionately more to charitable causes both from their household assets and from their foundations, trusts, and donor advised funds. Our analysis indicates that in recent years wealth has been leaving New Jersey in larger amounts than wealth has been entering the state due to household migration.”75



In sum, the wealthy are important to the states they reside in for many reasons. They pay a large share of state income taxes; they run businesses and create jobs; they invest in growth companies; and they engage in philanthropy. Time will tell how large the migration effect will be from the 2017 tax law. But even a modest increase in moves by top earners could be a substantial blow to high-tax states.



People age 65 and older accounted for 10 percent of interstate movers and 13 percent of the income of movers in 2016. States are increasingly putting out a welcome mat for this group by reducing taxes on retirement income and estates. The thinking is that seniors have substantial wealth to spend and they impose little cost on governments for services such as public schools.



Of the 41 states that impose broad-based income taxes, 36 provide special breaks for pension income.76 A few states offer full exemptions, but most have partial exemptions with a dollar cap. More states offer breaks for public pension income than for private pension income. But Illinois, for example, exempts nearly all public and private pension income, including income from 401(k) plans.77 The National Conference of State Legislatures says that states use such breaks as “an economic development tool by attracting retired people to, or retaining them in, a state.”78



Nearly all the states with an income tax used it to fully tax pension income. But beginning in the 1970s, states began adopting pension tax exemptions, often in regional patterns. They adopted them when neighboring states did so as a “weapon of policy competition,” said Karen Smith Conway and Jonathan Rork.79 Over time, exemption amounts have increased as states have raised the competitive bar to attract retirees.



A parallel trend has been the reduction of estate and inheritance taxes, as states have competed to attract wealthy retirees. All 50 states used to impose one or both of those “death taxes,” but today just 17 states and the District of Columbia do so.80 The remaining death-tax states are in the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont), the Northwest (Oregon and Washington), and the Midwest (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska). Kentucky and Hawaii also impose them.



Before 2005, the federal government provided individuals a credit against state death taxes up to a fixed amount, so it made sense for states to adopt a death tax up to that level. In earlier decades, many states imposed excess death taxes beyond the federal credit amount. In the 1960s, many states imposed taxes on estates of as little as $10,000.81 But since the 1970s, a competitive trend for states has been to reduce these excess death taxes.82



Then in 2005, the repeal of the federal credit accelerated the downsizing of death taxes. Since then, competition to attract wealthy retirees has prompted most states to completely repeal these taxes.83 Many of the states that have retained them have increased the exemption amounts.



Clearly, state policymakers believe that retirees are responsive to tax differences. Retirees are often footloose, and they can consult sources such as Kiplinger’s “10 Most Tax-Friendly States for Retirees, 2017” and SmartAsset’s “Most Tax Friendly Places for Retirees.”84 The latter is an interactive site with detailed tax information down to the county level, and it provides a “retirement tax friendliness index” for each location.



On its website, AARP discusses “Which States Provide the Best Tax Breaks for Retirees?”85 The organization is a vigorous lobbyist for reducing state taxes on retirement income, and it informs its 38 million members about state tax differences.86



Do taxes influence interstate moves by seniors? Statistical studies generally find that they do, but the results are mixed.



A 1992 study by David Clark and William Hunter finds that high inheritance and estate taxes deterred state in-migration.87 A 2004 study by Jon Bakija and Joel Slemrod finds that “high state inheritance and estate taxes and sales taxes have statistically significant, but modest, negative impacts on the number of federal estate tax returns filed in a state.”88 In 2001 and 2003 studies, Karen Smith Conway and Andrew Houtenville find that low income, property, and death taxes attract elderly migration.89 But in 2006 and 2012 studies, Smith Conway and Jonathan Rork find that death taxes and pension tax breaks have little, if any, effect on migration.90



However, the simple patterns of senior migration suggest that taxes do influence location decisions. Consider Kiplinger’s “State-by-State Guide to Taxes on Retirees,” which classifies each state as “most tax-friendly,” “tax-friendly,” “mixed,” “not tax-friendly,” and “least tax-friendly.”91 The classification considers income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, motor vehicle taxes, and taxes on pension income and Social Security benefits.



Those categories can be compared with the elderly migration ratios in column 1 of Table 2. For the 20 states that are “most tax-friendly” or “tax-friendly,” the average ratio is 1.11, meaning net in-migration. For the 20 “not” and “least” tax-friendly, the ratio is 0.90, meaning net out-migration. Thus, seniors are gravitating toward states that have the best retirement tax climates.



To get an idea of where the very wealthiest retirees are moving, we can look at federal estate tax returns. In 2016, federal estate taxes were potentially payable above exemption amounts of $5.45 million for singles and $10.9 million for married couples. Florida has 6 percent of the U.S. population, but its residents paid 17 percent of federal estate taxes in 2016.92 That figure is up from 12 percent 20 years ago. Meanwhile, the estate tax share in four high-tax northeastern states has fallen, as more of the wealthiest elderly Americans are living elsewhere.93



The passage of the 2017 federal tax law has heightened tax competition between the states. The capping of federal deductibility has increased the state and local tax bite on millions of households in high-tax states. At the same time, today people can easily find information to compare state tax burdens.



Some analysts say that people are migrating from northern states to southern states for the warmer climate, not lower taxes.94 Yet, as noted, only 2 percent of interstate movers say climate is the main reason for their move. The next few years under the new tax law should give us a clearer view.



More importantly, policymakers in northern states cannot do anything about the warm and sunny climate in southern states. But they can do something about taxes, housing costs, school quality, and other standard-of-living factors affected by government policy. By providing government services more efficiently at lower cost, states can both attract in-migrants and benefit current residents alike.



To grow, states need in-migrants of all types, not just retirees and the wealthy. Urban economist Edward Glaeser argues that attracting younger, educated people with modest incomes is perhaps more important than attracting older, wealthier people.95 He says that cities with young and brainy populations are best able to generate growth in our dynamic economy.



To attract all types of people and investment, states should create simple, neutral, low-rate tax codes. They should reduce regulations that dissuade entrepreneurship, and they should pursue land-use reforms to keep housing prices down.96 States should also inject more competition into public schooling to improve quality and attract families.



State policymakers should focus on increasing individual freedom. The Cato Institute publishes _Freedom in the 50 States_ , which scores the states on 175 variables covering fiscal, regulatory, and personal freedom.97 The variables generally measure the ability of individuals to act without government restraint.



In the 2016 edition of the report, William Ruger and Jason Sorens find that interstate migration flows are strongly correlated with state freedom scores after controlling for climate, the cost of living, and other factors. Numerous studies have confirmed a link between economic freedom and interstate migration.98 Americans are gravitating toward states offering greater individual freedom.



Those results are not surprising. Historically, the United States has been a huge draw for international migrants seeking economic and personal freedom. Freedom is a migration draw not just because it has intrinsic value but also because it fosters innovation and growth, which in turn attracts businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers.



Some U.S. states have been losing people from out-migration for decades. The new federal tax law should be a wake-up call for such laggard states to improve their tax codes, slim down their governments, and allow residents more economic and personal freedom.

They find, for example, that taxpayers in higher-tax California get less bang for their buck than taxpayers in lower-tax Texas. One reason is the excess compensation of employees in California government. Another reason is the excess regulation in California, which, for example, results in a mile of highway costing twice as much to build as in Texas.

Revived today the best novel on “global warming” could be explosive.
Guest essay by Walter Donway
I guess that if I discovered “State of Fear” by Michael Crichton eleven years after its publication in 2004–reading it last summer with indescribable surprise and joy–you can tolerate a year-old review.
This book could be the 1984 of “Big Climate Alarmism.” After George Orwell took on “doublespeak,” people never listened to political rhetoric in the same way. Whatever you think of the controversial “Atlas Shrugged,” by Ayn Rand, do you think arguments for the “greed” of businessmen and the moral loftiness of statism will ever be heard the same way?
Michael Critchton was perhaps the most scientifically literate and technologically brilliant best-selling novelist of our time. It turns out he was one of the most courageous, too. Fortunately, by the time he published “State of Fear,” a pounding thriller with more than 200 scientific footnotes meticulously documenting its all-assault on Big Climate Alarmism, his reputation was unassailable. Because, when he published it, the man who had written “The Andromeda Strain,” “Congo,” “Terminal Man,” “Jurraisic Park,” and “E.T.E.R.” got few reviews and those were mostly awful. Groups of scientists wrote letters scorning the science in the book.
Crichton never flinched. The book gave him a reputation as a climate change skeptic and in 2005 he testified before a Senate committee and had a private visit with President George W. Bush to discuss the issue.
Crichton died three years later, so we can never know if his popularity and reputation would have recovered from this astonishing act of integrity and devotion to science. He did it for the American people, but, I suspect, more out lifelong respect for science, which he saw squandering its reputation on “global warming.”
The problem was that in 2004 “global warming” still had tremendous momentum, all the excitement of discovery. The work of critics had only begun; there was not then the constituency for “The State of Fear”–to support it, publicize it, promote it–that there is today. Had there been, I believe it could have transformed the debate in the public mind.
What is astounding is that back in 2004, Crichton saw it all. As I write in the review:
“Melting glaciers, icebergs calving off Antarctic glaciers, worldwide weather records, rising sea levels, satellite measurements of atmospheric warming, correlation of carbon dioxide with warming, expanding or contracting deserts: State of Fear takes them on, and many others, with the ease that Agatha Christie presents clues to a murder.
“What will stop many readers, and not once, is the question: If these are the facts, what science actually says, then how in Hell do the shibboleths of global warming keep proliferating? Crichton’s answers include: dozens or hundreds of complicated issues raised when you discuss the history and future of the whole Earth, its geology, its inhabitants, its atmosphere, and its oceans; lack of almost any adequate data on any aspect of the debate; the deadly ‘precautionary principle’ that in the absence of enough data, assume that the most catastrophic prediction might be true and prepare (that is: with the least data, take the most extreme actions); the enormous self-interest of scientists funded almost overwhelmingly by a single source (government) that already has embraced the answer; the ever-shifting timeframes (most predictions with a 10-year horizon already have been falsified by events) that keep getting longer; changes in the hypothesis (from the idea that temperature will rise over a century to ‘abrupt weather changes’ today demonstrate global warming); and on and on.
“Incredibly, it all comes into the story—usually riding on a roller coaster of action or borne by a lover’s quarrel.”
Nothing could be more hopeful, today, with with Big Climate Alarmists succeeding, at least in America, in making their views government policy, than a wide revival of this powerful antidote. Candidates of the two parties for President have diametrically opposite views and “global warming,” but the mainstream media is like a crooked umpire on the take.
I urge you to get involved. Fortunately, reading “State of Fear” is not only hugely informative and heartening, it is thrilling.

It’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity.



That’s what people should really be thinking about global warming. Pretty much every serious student of climate change agrees that carbon dioxide, which is the product of the respiration of our civilization, is a “greenhouse gas.” Everything else being equal (which never holds), increasing its concentration should result in some rise in temperature in the lower atmosphere.



So the real question is not whether carbon dioxide causes warming, but how, and how much. We know more about the former than the latter. Greenhouse warming tends to amplify in dry atmospheres. So, cold, dry places should warm much more than warm, wet ones. Consequently, carbon dioxide preferentially warms winter versus summer, cold air versus warm air, and turns deserts into — deserts. Ever wonder why the old Soviets and today’s Russians really don’t care so much about this?



There’s much less certainty about the amount of warming. Make a few assumptions about increasing atmospheric water vapor (another potent greenhouse gas) and you can get a big “sensitivity” of temperature to doubling the amount of atmospheric CO2. This is a common way for climate modelers to forecast major heating. Those of us of a more empirical bent maintain that the evidence argues for a much lower value.



For a number of reasons having to do in no small part with the fact that scientists are human, the climate field — exemplified by the United Nations’ self‐​proclaimed “consensus” on matters climatic — tends to sell high sensitivities, famously drawing “fat tails” on the probability distributions for high levels of global warming.



Here’s how the UN sees it:





Note that these aren’t your typical “bell‐​shaped” distributions. Instead, they are skewed to the right with low, but not very low, probabilities for substantial warmings in excess of 5°C (9°F).



Why are there so many estimates? Because no one really knows in advance what the true sensitivity is.



Until recently, that is. A team of climate types headed by Andreas Schmittner at Oregon State has now calculated the sensitivity using very real world numbers that can be squeezed out of the various measures of surface temperature during the last ice age cycle. Their paper, which is listed as “in press” at _Science_ magazine, was on one of the authors’ websites (it has since been taken down, probably because _Science_ threw a tantrum about leaking something before they published it). It lowered the sensitivity from the UN’s range of 3.6–8.1°F (with a “best estimate” of 5.4°) to 3 to 4.7° and a mean of 4.1°.



Perhaps more important, the “fat tail” has been chopped off. Here’s their probability distribution:





The doomsday scenarios of climate cataclysm lie in the fat tail. More modest warmings are clearly adapted to quite easily. If someone hadn’t told you that the earth’s surface temperature is about 1.5°F warmer than it was after the Civil War, you would likely not have noticed. Since then, life expectancy and wealth have increased dramatically, with no apparent interference from climate change.



We haven’t heard the last from about this paper. Will Science publish it before the UN’s latest climate summit starts in Durban, South Africa, on November 28? Will the UN try to bury this important finding in its upcoming (2013) climate compendium? And, given the sad history of bullying and shunning that is rampant in climate science, will the editors who approved publication by shamed by the climategate mafia?



Who knows. Time will tell. It’s hard to imagine no repercussions for the authors’ finding of only “vanishing probabilities” of a warming of greater than 5.7°F. That’s a lot of cold water that’s just been thrown on the UN’s fat tail.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate scientists at Switzerland’s renowned ETH Zurich and the University of Bern have long warned of the risks of man-made global warming.
But in a brand new study their results now appear to have compelled them to postpone the expected global warming – by a few decades!

They now claim that a weaker sun (now expected over the coming decades) could reduce temperatures by half a degree Celsius.
Moreover the scientists clearly concede that the earth’s climate system is nowhere near as well understood as some scientists would like to have us believe and that the sun indeed plays a major role after all – enough so to override and postpone the effects of the often hyped greenhouse gases.
This will be hugely disappointing news for the catastrophe-hopers and cheerleaders, who hold front row tickets to the announced climate catastrophe, which according to some should be happening already.
The Swiss scientists say that sun’s impact on climate change has now been quantified “for first time” (see postscript below).
The Swiss scientists say that their model calculations show a plausible way that fluctuations in solar activity could have a tangible impact on the climate. The Swiss National Science Foundation-funded studies now expect human-induced global warming to tail off slightly over the next few decades. A weaker sun could reduce temperatures by half a degree.
The sun a factor after all
There is human-induced climate change, and there are natural climate fluctuations, the scientists acknowledge, and say one important factor in the unchanging rise and fall of the Earth’s temperature and its different cycles is the sun. As its activity varies, so does the intensity of the sunlight that reaches the earth’s surface. Previously IPCC reports assumed that recent solar activity was insignificant for climate change, and that the same would apply to activity in the near future.
“Significant effect”
However, researchers from the Physical Meteorological Observatory Davos (PMOD), the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG), ETH Zurich and the University of Bern are now qualifying this assumption. Their elaborate model calculations now provide a robust estimate of the contribution that the sun is expected to make to temperature change in the next 100 years and a significant effect is apparent.
They expect the Earth’s temperature to fall by half a degree when solar activity reaches its next minimum.

//-->




Project head Werner Schmutz, who is also Director of PMOD, says this reduction in temperature is significant and believes it could win valuable time if solar activity declines and slows the pace of global warming a little.
Strong fluctuations could explain past climate
At the end of March, the researchers working on the project will meet in Davos for a conference to discuss the final results. The project brought together various research institutions’ capabilities in terms of climate effect modelling. PMOD calculated what is known as “radiative forcing” taking account of particle as well as electromagnetic radiation, ETH Zurich worked out its further effects in the Earth’s atmosphere and the University of Bern investigated the interactions between the atmosphere and oceans.
Revamped the models
The Swiss researchers revamped the commonly used models, which were criticized for overstating CO2’s impact, and assumed a greater fluctuation in the radiation striking the Earth than previous models had done. According to their press release, Schmutz is convinced “this is the only way that we can understand the natural fluctuations in our climate over the last few millennia.” He says that other hypotheses, such as the effect of major volcanic eruptions, are less conclusive.
Huge uncertainty: Sun’s future behavior unknown
Exactly how the sun will behave over the next few years remains a matter of speculation, however, since appropriate data series have only been available for a few decades and they reveal no evidence of fluctuations during this time. “To that extent, our latest results are still a hypothesis,” says Schmutz, “and it remains difficult for solar physicists to predict the next cycle.”
Warnings of a little ice age?
But since we have been observing a consistently strong phase since 1950, it is highly likely that we will experience another low point in 50 to 100 years’ time. It could be every bit as intense as the Maunder Minimum, which brought particularly cold weather during the 17th century.
The research project also placed great importance on the historical perspective. The Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Bern compared data series on past solar activity with other specific climatic conditions. People have been recording the number of sunspots, which correlates well with solar activity levels, for some three centuries now.
However, it is much more difficult to quantify exactly how cold it was on Earth back then. “We know that the winters during the last minimum were very cold, at least in northern Europe,” says Schmutz.
Science in its infancy
The researchers still have a fair amount of work to do before they have a detailed understanding of the relationship between solar activity and the global climate both in the past and in the future.
PS:
It needs to be noted that other scientists have already quantified the sun’s impact to a lesser or similar extent, but were ignored. The latest Swiss studies merely confirm what dozens of other skeptic scientists have been saying over the past 10 years. Claims of being “the first” are a bit fake.

"Malcolm Turnbull met coal mining chiefs recently. He said later that the miners begged him to negotiate a compromise deal. They want the Liberals to lobby for exemptions from Penny Wong’s Ration-N-Tax Scheme.
The big miners supported the scheme in the belief that exporters would be exempt, and they would get government funds for fantasies like carbon capture and burial. Now they find that the dog they unleashed is menacing them.
Other Liberal leaders have said that big business wants the “certainty” of the Ration-NTax Scheme. There can be no certainty on the amount of damage any Ration-N-Tax Scheme will bring. The only way to get a “certain” outcome is to reject this bill entirely.
Surely no one except Mr Turnbull wants a Clayton’s version of the Ration-N-Tax Scheme, with a huge bureaucracy administering nothing useful to anyone – it must be thrown out.

"We can avoid the worst effects of climate change, say a team of Imperial College energy engineers in a recent study, and it will only cost US$2 trillion a year, at most. This sounds an unfeasibly large sum of money but in fact amounts to around 1% of projected world GDP in 2050.  The study is clear on its assumptions, well-researched and balanced, and a useful update on earlier studies of a least-cost engineered solution to the problem. But it does not include the effects of how the wider economy would respond to the transformation of the energy system. GDP could be higher or lower, for example, depending on the economic policies required to bring about the change. Man-made global warming is happening, climate scientists have warned again in the latest, fifth IPCC report released a few days ago. Since the previous report in 2007, levels of confidence have risen to 95% following greatly expanded lines of evidence that confirm earlier predictions. As is well understood, the problem is several centuries-worth of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is already higher than at any time over the last 800,000 years.  If we do not slow and ultimately stop adding to this build up of emissions then the potential for further damage rises. The Imperial College study argues that halving CO2 by 2050 will be enough to bring the prospective eventual rise of global temperatures to below 2°C. After 2050, this reduction must continue in order to maintain stable temperatures. Drawing upon the International Energy Agency’s 2010 report on the prospects for energy technologies, the researchers have trawled the literature for costs of low-carbon equipment and vehicles. The study assumes projected demands for the services we want – comfort, mobility, light, power – analyses them by sector (buildings, transport and industry), and includes a detailed discussion of power generation and bioenergy. It provides details of comprehensive investments in each sector with costs and effects on energy use and emissions for 10 world regions. It’s apparent how the mix of technologies varies according to regional resources and political priorities.  Using data on energy supplies and demands from 2010, a future reference scenario is constructed for 2050, assuming that CO2 emissions are halved by 2050. Around 1% of GDP for 2050 is assumed as a net cost, while the cost of new low carbon equipment is offset by the costs of the fossil-fuel-using alternatives that are no longer needed. Generally, the study’s range of cost estimates are not unduly optimistic. So the direct cost of 1% is modest in comparison to its benefits. As an insurance policy against the potential disaster of extreme climate change and the burdens of air pollution from fossil fuels puts on health, it seems cheap. Plus, the investment in low-carbon buildings, equipment and vehicles may well bring indirect economic benefits - higher incomes and new technologies that increase GDP and employment. While this study confirms others in pointing out what must be done - decarbonising the economy - it does not explain how it could be done, nor when. There may be a feasible solution for 2050, but we need an idea of the feasible pathways that will get us there. The carbon price the study finds as necessary varies between US$30 and US$39 per tonne of CO2 by 2050, depending on the assumed price of fossil fuels. This price is calculated by the increase in costs from 1 extra tonne of reducing CO2 emissions across the board at the point where the target of halving emissions by 2050 is achieved at minimal cost. But this price is low compared to the carbon prices beyond US$100 from studies for similar targets using models that incorporate economic responses. Either carbon prices must be much higher, or lower carbon prices need to be combined with other incentives and tighter regulations. This engineering approach probably overestimates the effects of changes in relative prices, given how long it is taking to transform energy generation systems. And imposing carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes come with their own political or practical difficulties. The policies required for the ideal engineering solutions have to be articulated more fully to inform governments how they should proceed. The team’s carbon price affects the prices of carbon-based fuels, yet there is no institutional detail. Implicitly there is a need to strengthen regulations and standards to reduce emissions from equipment and vehicles. Looking at a wider picture, if the transformation of the energy system were a component of a green growth policy, the engineering “costs” can be seen as investments in new technologies creating new industries and jobs. Indeed such a technological revolution could lead to higher growth in the long term."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s second largest power producer, RWE, reported staggering losses of 5.7 billion euros over the fiscal 2016 year, after the company had posted a net loss of near 200 million euros for 2015.
The latest results continue the growing string of woes occurring since 2013 when RWE posted a net loss of 2.76 billion euros – its first full-year loss since the power giant was founded in 1949.
Marketwatch here also reported that the Essen, Germany-based power company recommends scrapping the pay out of any dividends to shareholders. The scrapping of dividend payments would especially be a blow to stock owners such as municipal shareholders because they often depend on them each year to fund public facilities like schools and hospitals.
RWE scrapped dividend payments in 2015 as well.
The company booked impairment charges of 4.3 billion euros for electricity generation in 2016 “amid weak wholesale power prices“, Marketwatch reported.
Earnings were curtailed significantly through impairments of €4.3 billion. CEO of RWE AG Dr. Rolf Martin Schmitz: “The difficult market environment made impairments necessary. In addition, the nuclear energy fund imposed a substantial one-off burden on us.”
German wholesale power prices have massively eroded over the past years as a flood of highly subsidized wind and solar power has been given the right away into the power grid over fossil fuels. At times so much power is fed into the grid, especially on sunny and windy days, that the wholesale price even dips into negative territory, meaning power producers such as RWE have to pay to unload the surplus power.
Meanwhile many conventional plants must be always kept on standby for the many times wind and solar do not produce. The sub-capacity operation of the conventional power plants make them inefficient and non-profitable. On the consumer side, electricity prices have reached record levels at near 30 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour.

"The first new nuclear power station in Britain in nearly 20 years is to be built, an announcement that comes only two and a half years after the disaster at Fukushima focused the world’s attention the drawbacks of nuclear power. At a first glance it looks like the nuclear industry is back in business in Europe. The deal between French energy giant EDF, which operates Britain’s existing nuclear power plants, and the planned Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, and the British government was pitched as a win-win situation for everybody. The consumers are assured of their electricity supply, the government invests in jobs and bolsters a “cutting-edge” low carbon technology that will help Britain hit it’s CO2 emissions targets, and EDF secures a profit margin of 10%. The deal guarantees EDF a price of £92.50 (about €110) per megawatt hour (MWh) for 35 years from the time the plant starts generating, inflation linked to the consumer price index. The UK government, in its overflowing generosity, has also agreed to underwrite 65% of the £16 billion cost of building the plant. But looking at the numbers more closely reveals a different picture. A picture, in fact, that is entirely the opposite. The deal is a confession in public, a statement of failure of a technology that was never and probably will never be built and operated at competitive cost. This becomes clear when comparing nuclear power with other options that society has at its disposal to replace fossil fuel energy, tackle climate change, and foster energy independence. In Germany, Energiewende, or energy transition, a grand project to de-carbonise energy generation, had already begun in 2000 when a feed-in-tariff scheme was introduced to help ease renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into the market. Back then, the total share of electricity generated from renewable energy was about 6.5%, with about 4% accounted for by hydroelectric power. That has increased to almost 25% in 2013, with solar, onshore wind and biomass power contributing the most. By installing a lot of capacity and therefore scaling the learning curve quickly, Germany has made big advances in cost reduction. The idea of a “learning curve” comes from business production and innovation research. It holds - and this can be empirically proven by examining the falling costs of technology in the past - that a new technology’s production cost falls by 20-40% with each doubling of the cumulative produced capacity, assuming a 70-80% learning rate. So new technologies coming to the market initially benefit from a greater decline in costs as doubling the capacity comes more quickly with a small installed base. Mature technologies, like nuclear which is over 60 years old, have already plateaued, making further cost reduction much more difficult. In Germany, the current feed-in-tariffs of 2013 for different energy technologies are derived from the levelised cost of energy. That is, it incorporates the capital cost of building power plants or turbines, the discounted rate, and the running costs of continuous operation, fuel, and maintenance. Through intensive early investment in promising new technologies, the current level of feed-in-tariff for onshore wind is £70-80/MWh, and for solar power is between £85/MWh for open area and £120/MWh for roof-top panels, guaranteed to recoup their capital in 20 years without any inflation-adjustment. The nuclear “strike price” for Hinkley Point C included in the UK Energy Bill’s Contracts for Difference - essentially comparable to Germany’s feed-in-tariffs - is around £90/MWh, inflation-adjusted and guaranteed for 35 years. In order to make these figures directly comparable we need to make assumptions on what inflation will be over the next 45 years (including ten years to build and come on-stream), and calculate what costs are recouped over 20 years, as the German feed-in-tariffs were designed to do. Assuming an inflation rate of only 2% per year (an average rate since the financial crisis, but historically low), this works out as £290/MWh (calculations, publication forthcoming, provided by Carsten Pfeifer and Björn Pieprzyk from the German Renewable Energy Federation BEE (Bundesverband Erneuerbare Energie). We might allow that wind and solar power varies with conditions, and that they require either energy storage systems or flexible conventional power station capacity as a back-up. But even taking this into account, the current subsidies in Britain through Contracts for Difference, at £105-155/MWh for biomass, £100/MWh for onshore wind, £155/MWh for offshore wind, and £125/MWh for large solar power installations guaranteed for 15 years, it is very clear that the economies of nuclear power make no sense at all. And of course the huge build costs - £16 billion - are at the moment merely theoretical. Areva, the French firm who will build the Hinkley Point plant, is currently building a similar plant at Olkiluoto in Finland, where costs have risen by 60% during construction, from £2.7 to £5.5 billion. Other big infrastructure projects worldwide - and particularly in Britain - show that final project costs are never close to those calculated initially. And what will the cost be to taxpayers of the future to deal with the waste generated by another generation of nuclear plants, in addition to the costs of those of the last 50 years? It is probably another bottomless pit. Costs for renewables, on the other hand, are expected to drop further - the world-wide boom in investing in these technologies has just begun. And, in contrast to uranium, the “fuel” for wind and solar power is locally sourced and abundant in Britain, driving towards a more energy secure and independent country - the real win-win situation for everybody. Matthias Reeg writes for The Conversation in a personal capacity, and his views do not represent those of his institution."
"LONDON  —   Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain refused to comment on Sunday about the reported failure of an unarmed British Trident missile that was   from a submarine off the coast of Florida in June. Mrs. May said in a television interview with the BBC that she had “absolute faith in our Trident missiles. ” But she would not say whether she had known about the failure or whether, as The Sunday Times of London reported, it had been covered up by Downing Street under her predecessor, David Cameron, shortly before the referendum on Britain’s exit from the European Union. Mrs. May did not mention any missile failure in her first major speech to Parliament on July 18, when she persuaded Parliament to spend up to 40 billion pounds, or about $53 billion then, on four new submarines to keep Britain’s nuclear deterrent up to date. “There are tests that take place all the time, regularly, for our nuclear deterrence,” she said on Sunday. “What we were talking about in that debate that took place was about the future. ” The Sunday Times reported that the Trident II D5 missile, which was designed to carry a nuclear warhead but was unarmed for the test, had veered off course after being fired from HMS Vengeance, one of Britain’s four aging   submarines. The British Navy had not performed such a test for four years because of the expense of the missile, but had carried out tests in 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2012, all of which had been successful and publicized by the Ministry of Defense. The current test took place after the submarine had been refitted with new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems. Replacing Trident has been controversial because of the cost and because the current leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, long an antinuclear campaigner, is opposed to retaining Britain’s nuclear deterrent, while his party’s official position has been to retain and renew it. “It’s a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction, and while it wasn’t armed, goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been,” Mr. Corbyn said on Sunday. Speaking to Sky News, he said, “We understand the prime minister chose not to inform Parliament, and instead it came out through the media. ” He repeated his belief that Britain should commit to nuclear disarmament. Kevan Jones, a Labour member of Parliament and a former defense minister, called for an inquiry into the failed missile test. “The U. K.’s independent nuclear deterrent is a vital cornerstone for the nation’s defense,” he said. Parliament is likely to ask Defense Secretary Michael Fallon to answer questions about the report. Separately, Mrs. May confirmed that she would meet with President Trump in Washington on Friday in the first visit of a foreign leader to the new president, a traditional prize that Britain has been seeking avidly. She said she would emphasize to Mr. Trump the importance of the NATO military alliance, calling it a “bulwark” of the West, and would say that Britain favors the progress and cohesion of the European Union, even though the country plans to leave the bloc. Trade will be an important topic, she said, with Britain wanting new   agreements with key countries, including the United States, after it leaves the European Union. Mr. Trump, a supporter of “Brexit,” as Britain’s departure from the bloc is known, has said that he is open to early talks on such a deal with Britain. Legally, no new deal can be made until Britain formally leaves the European Union, which is unlikely for at least two years. Mr. Trump’s slogan of “America First” and his protectionist comments may mean that a trade deal will be difficult to negotiate despite the good will expressed by both sides. Mrs. May was asked about Mr. Trump’s attitudes toward women. “I’ve already said that some of the comments that Donald Trump has made in relation to women are unacceptable, some of those he himself has apologized for,” she said. When she meets Mr. Trump, she said, “I think the biggest statement that will be made about the role of women is the fact that I will be there as a female prime minister. ”"
"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has claimed Extinction Rebellion activists are “so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals” who threaten key planks of national life. The government’s rhetorical venom against XR was triggered by the blockading of newspaper print works at the weekend, which disrupted the distribution of some newspapers and led to scores of arrests. The Guardian understands, however, that despite the government threatening to crack down on the climate emergency group, more than a year of talks between police and ministers about law changes has yet to produce any public plans. Patel described XR as an “emerging threat” in a speech to the annual conference of the Police Superintendents’ Association on Tuesday. She said XR was “attempting to thwart the media’s right to publish without fear nor favour”, and claimed their campaign of civil disobedience was “a shameful attack on our way of life, our economy and the livelihoods of the hard-working majority”. “I refuse point blank to allow that kind of anarchy on our streets,” the home secretary told the virtual conference. “The very criminals who disrupt our free society must be stopped. And together we must all stand firm against the guerilla tactics of Extinction Rebellion.” More than 100 protesters used vehicles and bamboo structures to block roads outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, and Knowsley, near Liverpool, on Friday evening. It took until Saturday to fully remove them. The presses print the News UK titles including the Sun, Times, Sun on Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, and Daily Mail. Over the weekend government briefings floated the idea of classing XR as an “organised crime group”. Neither Patel nor the policing minister Kit Malthouse repeated that idea in the Commons on Monday, with police believing it is nonsense. The police regard XR as a non-violent group committed to civil disobedience that is time-consuming and costly for officers to deal with. One senior police source said officers had enough powers: “The powers are there. They [XR] are not an organised crime group. Part of the definition of an OCG is they commit violence in achieving their aims, and no one seriously suggests XR commit violence.” Police who dealt with the XR weekend action described it as “sophisticated” and a well-prepared military-style operation. One source said: “It takes hours to get them off. You have to go slowly and carefully.” Last year XR caused disruption in London with their campaigns, triggering talks between police chiefs and the Home Office about changes to specific sections of the 1986 Public Order Act. The Guardian understands that changes could include lowering the threshold at which police can place restrictions. One change could mean the prospect of “disruption” is enough to impose tough conditions, not “serious disruption” as the act currently states. Sarah Lunnon, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, said: “Our media and our government are captured by vested interests. They do not want to see change. Three companies alone own 87% of the national newspaper market. “These powerful vested interests are the real organised criminals. They are the true threat to our democracy. And it’s depressing – although no surprise – that so much of the political and media elite has jumped to their defence, and jumped at the opportunity to suppress people power and grassroots protest. We will not allow them to criminalise the noble tradition of non-violent civil disobedience.”"
"The Covid-19 pandemic will deliver an unprecedented annual drop in global greenhouse gas emissions of up to 7% by the end of 2020, but the slowdown’s impact on the atmosphere will be almost imperceptible, according to a major report led by the United Nations. Analysis of fossil fuel burning found emissions hit their lowest daily rate in April but by June – as economies began to open up again – emissions were returning to the same levels seen the previous year.  Dr Pep Canadell, from Australia’s CSIRO climate science centre and one of the report’s authors, said by the close of 2020 the pandemic’s impact on slowing emissions would be at least twice that of the 2007 global financial crisis, when economic activity dropped. “For this year, what this means for the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere fundamentally, is nothing,” Canadell told Guardian Australia. “That’s because we put 42bn tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere last year so even three per cent less means we are still loading the atmosphere so heavily that this is not even a blip.” The United in Science report was launched Wednesday in Geneva by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who said recovery from the pandemic needed to be turned into an opportunity to tackle the climate crisis. Using analysis of global emissions up to June, the report found 2020 would see a drop of between 4% and 7% based on 2019 levels. The report, coordinated by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization, said: “Although such a drop appears to be unprecedented, the amount emitted at peak confinement was still equivalent to emissions in 2006, just a decade and a half ago.” In early April, daily global emissions from fossil fuels were down 17% compared to the average for the previous year. By early June, the report said emissions had mostly returned to the levels of the same period in 2019, “showing the rapid return of emissions, as many countries loosened their confinement restrictions.” The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is growing at about three parts per million each year. The drop in emissions for 2020 would translate to a drop of 0.23 ppm at most, which the report said was well within the changes seen year to year from natural factors. In a statement, WMO secretary general Prof Petteri Taalas said: “Greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise.” He said the years 2016 to 2020 was likely to be the warmest five-year period on record, adding: “This report shows that whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated.” Canadell, the executive director of the Global Carbon Project, told Guardian Australia the emissions fall would be unprecedented, even compared to a 1.5% drop experienced from the global financial crisis. But he said if the economic crisis sparked by the pandemic was to continue and more countries entered recession the world could see sustained falls of emissions for several years. He said: “We may have peaked with emissions last year, and then this year we have a decline. We could ride the wave all the way to zero over the next few decades.” Canadell said the fall in emissions in 2020 and further potential drops could prompt governments to react in two different ways. Some governments may become complacent, whereas others could see the economic recovery as a chance to further mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. If governments did not take active steps to build cleaner economies then greenhouse gas emissions could surge as economies emerged from recession. “There’s opportunity and risk as we go forward,” he said. The report also summarised the world’s changing climate and major impacts over recent years. Between 2020 and 2024, there was a one-in-four chance of the world experiencing a year when global average temperatures were 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The three biggest economic losses on record from wildfires had occurred in the last four years. The underlying heat that drove fires in the Arctic region in early 2020 was at least 600 times more likely because of caused climate change, the report said. Every year from 2016 to 2020 had seen the Arctic left with below-average levels of sea ice at the end of each summer. Arctic sea ice in July 2020 was the lowest on record for that month. Loss of ice from ice sheets connected to land in Antarctica and Greenland was continuing to push sea levels higher, the report said."
"

Earlier this week, Leslie Stahl and _60 Minutes_ got into the subject of global warming with President Trump.   
  
  
Her question, “Do you still think climate change is a hoax” followed background on recent hurricanes Michael, Florence, Maria, and Harvey.   
  
  
The President’s response was “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again. I don’t think it’s a hoax, I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s manmade.”   
  
  
This is a huge walk‐​back from his old rhetoric, which was enough to make scientists like me cringe.   
  
  
And in the context of hurricanes, his comment is also is consistent with what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) said in its September 20 statement titled “Global Warming and Hurricanes”: “In the Atlantic, it is premature to conclude that human activities–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on hurricane activity.”   
  
  
It is noteworthy that GFDL’s statement was in an update, and that “Global Warming and Hurricanes” has said the same about Atlantic hurricanes for years, long predating the Trump Administration.   
  
  
Stahl then went on to Greenland. Here’s the relevant transcript:   




Lesley Stahl: I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.   
  
  
President Donald Trump: And you don’t know whether that would have happened with or without man. You don’t know.



Another reasonable response. For reasons having nothing to do with humans, ice‐​covered areas in Greenland endured 6,000 years of warming centering around 118,000 years ago that, in terms of integrated heating, was larger than anything humans can do to it. Yet it only lost about 30% of its ice. There were certainly more “huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising sea levels” back then, with no human influence on climate.   
  
  
It’s also true that the current high‐​latitude north polar warming is largely (but not completely) consistent with global warming theory.   
  
  
Finally, they got into a “he said, he said” discussion about climate scientists’ various viewpoints. Here’s how it ended:   




Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it’s worse than ever?   
  
  
President Donald Trump: You’d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.   
  
  
Lesley Stahl: I can’t bring them in.   
  
  
President Donald Trump: Look, scientists also have a political agenda.



No, _60 Minutes_ cannot be expected to bring in hundreds of scientists on either side of this debate to investigate whether or not they have a political agenda. But Al Gore may have been on to something in his comments on the recent UN report claiming temperature increases of a mere 0.6°C will be catastrophic. He said it was “torqued up a little bit, appropriately — how [else] do they get the attention of policy‐​makers around the world”[?].   
  
  
Hmmm. Seems like a political agenda.

One of the best things about the COVID-19 pandemic is that everyone has forgotten about climate change. We are all much more worried about getting sick; about infecting others or being infected by others; of looking after elderly parents or relatives and trying to survive financially. Times are tough for a lot of people, and going down to Level 3 isn’t going to improve life for everyone. So, amid all of these real concerns, everyone seems to have forgotten about the imaginary crises, namely the transgender issues, and climate change.



Well, perhaps not everyone. Guess who is trying to raise his head above the parapet of irrelevance.



James obviously doesn’t realise that, with no planes flying, few trains and buses and hardly anyone using their cars, carbon dioxide emissions must be going through the floor. This should be good news to the Minister for Climate Change, of course, but it is not. Along with a large part of the population, he may find himself heading towards redundancy soon. Regardless, he is definitely heading towards total irrelevance.



How delightful.



Not to be outdone, another Green minister raised her head recently, with an even more ridiculous proposal, all in the name of relevancy.



Surely she cannot be serious. The government is going to be cash strapped trying to keep the business community going, and paying thousands more people on unemployment benefit to bother about pop-up cycleways and footpath extensions, when we are all walking around supermarket aisles with other people in them relatively safely.



[Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/120970386/how-coronavirus-will-change-the-face-of-the-cbd) reports:



Life after lock down may look very different to before – and that even includes city streets.



Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter has revealed planning is already underway for expanded footpaths and temporary cycleways so people can still keep two metres of physical distance when the current Alert Level 4 for Coronavirus is lifted.



The government is set to roll out millions of dollars in extra funding for the work, which will start as soon as the country moves to Alert Level 3.



Genter said physical distancing would still likely be required for some time, probably until a vaccine or better treatment for covid-19 was available, so temporary solutions that could be put in place quickly were needed.



“When people begin to return to city centres following the lock down we want them to have enough space to maintain physical distance. Some of our footpaths in busy areas are quite narrow. Temporary footpath extensions mean people can give each other a bit more space without stepping out onto the road.”



This is just posturing. Why would a cash strapped government spend money on typical Green temporary nice-to-haves, when they need to concentrate on real infrastructure projects to keep the economy going?



(Incidentally, I’m not sure how much Genter paid Tracy Watkins to call her the Transport Minister when she is merely an associate transport minister.)



The people who will really need to concentrate on their social distancing once we come out of lockdown are older people, and the last time I looked, you don’t see many of them on bikes.



Coronavirus has taken the oxygen away from a lot of politicians, including National MPs to a large extent, but that is only to be expected in a time of crisis. Winston Peters is still on the radar as deputy prime minister, and he may get an election boost because of it. The Greens on the other hand, with their climate change agendas, their focus on race and gender issues and their expensive plans for making cities unlivable for most of us, have completely gone off the radar. They know it, but there is little they can do to make themselves relevant again, because all of their programmes and policies are so… irrelevant at a time of national crisis. 



Once the world starts getting back to normal to such an extent that people can concentrate on less important issues again, climate change will be long forgotten. Emissions will have dropped quite a bit anyway, and it may be that governments take steps to keep things that way. Farmers will be the backbone of our economy again. Planting trees will be less important than growing herds, and rivers will be generally cleaner because we won’t have the same number of overseas tourists. The world will likely be a different place, and along with all the other things that never really mattered, the Greens will have disappeared too. 



So maybe there are some upsides to a pandemic after all.

We are now all in lockdown. There may be items we can not obtain, there are things we cannot do, there are places we cannot go. But there are also some positives. Please feel free to add to the list of things I am not missing.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The Conversation is worried that climate disaster films like Sharknado might damage the credibility of climate scientists, because sometimes the characters in such movies use scientific sounding language to discuss preposterous fictional climate disasters.
Why ‘Sharknado 4’ matters: Do climate disaster movies hurt the climate cause?
…
At their heart, however, the “Sharknado” films are stories about climate change, albeit in a way that is scientifically flawed to a comical degree. It’s a genre – climate disaster films – we decided to explore as an emerging mode of communication in society.
Fiction helps us understand reality
It’s explained in the original “Sharknado” that climate change has created an unusually strong tropical cyclone approaching Southern California. The sequels backed away from that explanation, whether out of a desire to avoid courting political controversy or simply because the creators felt that sharknados needed no explanation, we can’t be sure. But casting climate change as a catalyst for extreme, globally threatening natural disasters is a move characteristic of a small but growing genre of climate disaster films.
…
To get a better sense of how fictional disaster films shape environmental attitudes, I (Lauren) conducted an in-depth analysis of 18 disaster films featuring climate change. The results of my research show that most of these films make only tenuous connections between climate change and natural disasters, which affects how people react to them.
Terminology related to climate change and extreme weather is often misused, and it’s not uncommon to see films that use the term “climate change” or “global warming” to refer to completely different phenomena – some of which are physically impossible and could happen in no world. For example, one film uses climate change to discuss a buildup of methane gas in the atmosphere that is predicted to ignite, incinerating all life on Earth.
The results from focus groups I held with participants who watched one of three representative disaster films confirm that these scientifically dubious depictions of climate change dilute any perceived environmental message in climate disaster films. Most participants were unconvinced – often with good reason – that anything shown in the films could happen in the real world and did not see much of an environmental message.
…
It’s worth noting, however, that “The Day After Tomorrow” was an exception within the larger climate disaster film genre, both in terms of its production value and its (relatively) detailed discussion of climate change. Low-budget films like “Sharknado,” which stray very far afield from climate science, likely pose different possibilities for both misinformation and engagement with climate change. The question, then, is how to best tap into this potential while avoiding the pitfalls.
Read more: https://theconversation.com/why-sharknado-4-matters-do-climate-disaster-movies-hurt-the-climate-cause-63155
I suspect films like Sharknado are more about mockery of establishment climate narratives, than about promoting concern. The credibility of climate as an urgent issue has long since passed. When given a choice between different issues, people consistently rate climate as one of their lowest priorities.

In a lifetime of observing and participating in politics, the world wide campaign by the international green movement (aided by the power-seeking UN bureaucracy) to monitor, control and tax every food, energy and transport business in the world is the most dangerous development I have ever seen. It has the potential to blight the lives and investments of the majority of Australians who are unable to find a safe place for themselves on the government payroll or in the protected Climate Change Industry.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on the Australian Parliament to repudiate the Copenhagen giveaways promised by PM Rudd to the failed states of Africa and the welfare beggars of the islands.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the three Climate Crusaders, Obama, Brown and Rudd, had been comprehensively conned in Copenhagen by African mendicants and fakers from the islands.
“They have agreed to hand over mega-bucks of our money (anywhere from $5 billion to $100 billion) as compensation for alleged damage caused by our production of carbon dioxide – the Africans citing climate damage and the islanders claiming rising sea levels. “Even a cursory examination of the facts would prove that both of these claims are fraudulent.

"Joe Biden will not pull any punches with allies including Australia in seeking to build international momentum for stronger action on the climate crisis, an adviser to the US presidential candidate has said. If elected in November, Biden will hold heavy emitters such as China accountable for doing more “but he’s also going to push our friends to do more as well”, according to Jake Sullivan, who was the national security adviser to Biden when he was vice-president and is now in the candidate’s inner circle. In a wide-ranging podcast interview with the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, Sullivan also signalled that Biden would work closely with Australia and other regional allies in responding to the challenges posed by the rise of China. While Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, is likely to welcome the pledge of US coordination with allies on regional security issues, there may be unease in government ranks about the potential for tough conversations about Australia’s climate policies. The Coalition government has resisted calls to embrace a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and it proposes to use Kyoto carryover credits to meet Australia’s 2030 emission reductions pledge. Some Coalition backbenchers still openly dispute climate science. Sullivan said climate change would be a big priority for Biden, both in domestic policy – with climate and clean energy issues placed at the heart of his economic recovery visions – and in foreign policy, where he would do more than just reverse Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris agreement. “He has said right out of the gate, we’re not just rejoining Paris – we are going to rally the nations of the world to get everyone to up their game, to elevate their ambition, to do more,” Sullivan told the Lowy Institute. “And in that regard he will hold countries like China accountable for doing more but he’s also going to push our friends to do more as well and to step up and fulfil their responsibilities to what is fundamentally a global problem, that every country needs to be participating in and contributing to.” Sullivan said there was “no reason it has to get awkward” for countries like Australia. “The vice-president is not going to come to play games around that issue if he’s fortunate enough to be elected. He’ll lay it out in the way only Joe Biden can do – just plain and straight, down the line, respectful – but he’s not going to pull any punches on it.” Sullivan made the remarks in an interview with Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the Lowy Institute, who told Guardian Australia last month that climate was likely to “come roaring back as an issue in US foreign policy under a Biden administration” and that it “may be harder to say no to a Biden administration”. Biden has vowed to put the US on “an irreversible path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide” by 2050, and to rally the rest of the world to meet the climate threat – indicating that he would “fully integrate climate change” into US foreign policy and national security strategies, as well as its approach to trade. The economist Ross Garnaut has also speculated that a Biden win could lead to Australia being placed “in the naughty corner” on climate policy. More broadly, Sullivan said Biden would be “eager to develop a really strong relationship” with Morrison – who has formed close working ties with Trump, even though the Australian government has emphasised  points of difference from time to time. Sullivan said Biden had a deep respect for Australia and its contributions to US security and the history of the alliance between the two countries. Biden and Morrison were likely to “get off to a strong start” because the former vice-president saw Australia as the kind of partner that was central to a finding successful strategies when faced with a range of issues in a fast-changing world. Sullivan said Biden put like-minded democratic allies at the heart of his foreign policy, because he believed that was the platform upon which the US could most effectively deal with great power competition and transnational challenges. “Allies are going to have pride of place in the hierarchy of priorities in a Biden administration foreign policy,” Sullivan said. He said allies including Australia, Japan, South Korea and Nato were important not just on regional issues but more broadly. “And yes, the rise of China is at or near the top of the list of big global challenges that we all have to be working effectively together on.”"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
University of Sussex and Vienna School of International Studies are concerned that countries with policies which favour nuclear power aren’t making enough effort to reduce CO2 emissions by installing solar power and wind turbines.
University of Sussex Press Release;
Pro-nuclear countries making slower progress on climate targets
With Hinkley Point deal hanging in the balance, study casts fresh doubts over future of nuclear energy in Europe
A strong national commitment to nuclear energy goes hand in hand with weak performance on climate change targets, researchers at the University of Sussex and the Vienna School of International Studies have found.
A new study of European countries, published in the journal Climate Policy, shows that the most progress towards reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy sources – as set out in the EU’s 2020 Strategy – has been made by nations without nuclear energy or with plans to reduce it.
Conversely, pro-nuclear countries have been slower to implement wind, solar and hydropower technologies and to tackle emissions.
While it’s difficult to show a causal link, the researchers say the study casts significant doubts on nuclear energy as the answer to combating climate change.
“By suppressing better ways to meet climate goals, evidence suggests entrenched commitments to nuclear power may actually be counterproductive.”
Professor Andy Stirling, Professor of Science and Technology Policy at the University of Sussex, said: “Looked at on its own, nuclear power is sometimes noisily propounded as an attractive response to climate change. Yet if alternative options are rigorously compared, questions are raised about cost-effectiveness, timeliness, safety and security.
“Looking in detail at historic trends and current patterns in Europe, this paper substantiates further doubts.
“By suppressing better ways to meet climate goals, evidence suggests entrenched commitments to nuclear power may actually be counterproductive.”
The study divides European countries into three, roughly equal in size, distinct groups:
Group 1: no nuclear energy (such as Denmark, Ireland and Norway)
Group 2: existing nuclear commitments but with plans to decommission (eg Germany, Netherlands and Sweden)
Group 3: plans to maintain or expand nuclear capacity (eg Bulgaria, Hungary and the UK)
They found that Group 1 countries had reduced their emissions by an average of six per cent since 2005 and had increased renewable energy sources to 26 per cent.
Group 2 countries, meanwhile, fared even better on emissions reductions, which were down 11 per cent. They grew renewable energy to 19 per cent.
However, Group 3 countries only managed a modest 16 per cent renewables share and emissions on average actually went up (by three per cent).
The UK is a mixed picture. Emissions have been reduced by 16 per cent, bucking the trend of other pro-nuclear countries. However, only five per cent of its energy comes from renewables, which is among the lowest in Europe, pipped only by Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands.
The team say that the gigantic investments of time, money and expertise in nuclear power plants, such as the proposed Hinckley Point C in the UK, can create dependency and ‘lock-in’ – a sense of ‘no turning back’ in the nation’s psyche.
Technological innovation then becomes about seeking ‘conservative’ inventions – that is new technologies that preserve the existing system. This is, inevitably, at the expense of more radical technologies, such as wind or solar.
Professor Benjamin Sovacool, Professor of Energy Policy and Director of the Sussex Energy Group at the University of Sussex, said: “The analysis shows that nuclear power is not like other energy systems. It has a unique set of risks, political, technical and otherwise, that must be perpetually managed.
“If nothing else, our paper casts doubt on the likelihood of a nuclear renaissance in the near-term, at least in Europe.”
Lead author Andrew Lawrence of the Vienna School of International Relations said: “As the viability of the proposed Hinkley plant is once again cast into doubt by the May government, we should recall that — as is true of nuclear fallout — nuclear power’s inordinate expense and risks extend across national borders and current generations.
“Conversely, cheaper, safer, and more adaptable alternative energy sources are available for all countries.”

The abstract of the study;
Nuclear energy and path dependence in Europe’s ‘Energy union’: coherence or continued divergence?
Since its initial adoption, the EU’s 2020 Strategy – to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increase the share of renewable energy to at least 20% of consumption, and achieve energy savings of 20% or more by 2020 – has witnessed substantial albeit uneven progress. This article addresses the question of what role nuclear power generation has played, and can or should play in future, towards attaining the EU 2020 Strategy, particularly with reference to decreasing emissions and increasing renewables. It also explores the persistent diversity in energy strategies among member states. To do so, it first surveys the current landscape of nuclear energy use and then presents the interrelated concepts of path dependency, momentum, and lock-in. The article proceeds to examine five factors that help explain national nuclear divergence: technological capacity and consumption; economic cost; security and materiality; national perceptions; and political, ideological and institutional factors. This divergence reveals a more general weakness in the 2020 Strategy’s underlying assumptions. Although energy security – defined as energy availability, reliability, affordability, and sustainability – remains a vital concern for all member states, the 2020 Strategy does not explicitly address questions of political participation, control, and power. The inverse relationship identified here – between intensity of nuclear commitments, and emissions mitigation and uptake of renewable sources – underscores the importance of increasing citizens’ levels of energy policy awareness and participation in policy design.

Even James Hansen, former NASA GISS director and arguably the originator of the global climate movement, believes nuclear power is an essential component of the path to a low carbon future.
Unless you are lucky enough to have the right geography for large scale hydro, nuclear is the only proven low carbon means of producing reliable biddable baseload power.
To argue that countries which have a strong commitment to nuclear power are not “doing their bit” to reduce CO2 emissions in my opinion is total lunacy.

From the fear and self-loathing in Capetown department, Josh had this take on it awhile back.

Phys.org reports:
The Anthropocene, or “new age of man,” would start from the mid-20th century if their recommendation—submitted Monday to the International Geological Congress in Cape Town, South Africa—is adopted.
That approval process is likely to take at least two years and requires ratification by three other academic bodies.
But after seven years of deliberation, the 35-strong Working Group has unanimously recognised the Anthropocene as a reality, and voted 30-to-three (with two abstentions) for the transition to be officially registered.
“Our working model is that the optimal boundary is the mid-20th century,” said Jan Zalasiewicz, a geologist at the University of Leicester.
“If adopted—and we’re a long way from that—the Holocene would finish and the Anthropocene would formally be held to have begun.”
Scientists refer to the period starting from 1950 as the “Great Acceleration”, and a glance at graphs tracking a number of chemical and socio-economic changes make it obvious why.

From the Times:
The Working Group on the Anthropocene (AWG), which is meeting in Cape Town this week, is proposing that the starting date for the new epoch should be set for around 1950.
The group’s committee of 35 members voted by a majority of 20 to recognise the new time division as an epoch, rather than the lower ranked age, such as a subdivision of the Holocene, or a higher ranked period like the Jurassic or Cretaceous.
The search is now on to find what geologists call a “golden spike”, a physical reference point that can be dated and taken as a representative starting point for the Anthropocene epoch.
A river bed in Scotland, for example, is taken to be the representative starting point for the Holocene epoch.







Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, a palaeobiologist at the University of Leicester and a member of the working group, said carbon and nitrogen levels in the atmosphere had remained reasonably steady before the “great acceleration” of the 20th Century.
“Human action has certainly left traces on the earth for thousands of years, if you know where to look,” he said.
“The difference between that and what has happened in the last century or so is that the impact is global and taking place at pretty much the same time across the whole Earth.
“It is affecting the functioning of the whole earth system.”
The concept of an Anthropocene epoch was first proposed by Nobel-prize winning chemist Paul Crutzen and colleague Eugene Stoermer in 2000.
This week’s AWG vote is scientific endorsement that the epoch is geologically real and of a sufficient scale to be considered for formal adoption as part of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart.

From their website:
What is the ‘Anthropocene’? – current definition and status

The ‘Anthropocene’ is a term widely used since its coining by Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer in 2000 to denote the present time interval, in which many geologically significant conditions and processes are profoundly altered by human activities. These include changes in: erosion and sediment transport associated with a variety of anthropogenic processes, including colonisation, agriculture, urbanisation and global warming. the chemical composition of the atmosphere, oceans and soils, with significant anthropogenic perturbations of the cycles of elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and various metals. environmental conditions generated by these perturbations; these include global warming, ocean acidification and spreading oceanic ‘dead zones’. the biosphere both on land and in the sea, as a result of habitat loss, predation, species invasions and the physical and chemical changes noted above.


The ‘Anthropocene’ is not a formally defined geological unit within the Geological Time Scale. A proposal to formalise the ‘Anthropocene’ is being developed by the ‘Anthropocene’ Working Group for consideration by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, with a current target date of 2016. Care should be taken to distinguish the concept of an ‘Anthropocene‘ from the previously used term Anthropogene (cf. below**).


The ‘Anthropocene’ is currently being considered by the Working Group as a potential geological epoch, i.e. at the same hierarchical level as the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs, with the implication that it is within the Quaternary Period, but that the Holocene has terminated. It might, alternatively, also be considered at a lower (Age) hierarchical level; that would imply it is a subdivision of the ongoing Holocene Epoch.


Broadly, to be accepted as a formal term the ‘Anthropocene’ needs to be (a) scientifically justified (i.e. the ‘geological signal’ currently being produced in strata now forming must be sufficiently large, clear and distinctive) and (b) useful as a formal term to the scientific community. In terms of (b), the currently informal term ‘Anthropocene’ has already proven to be very useful to the global change research community and thus will continue to be used, but it remains to be determined whether formalisation within the Geological Time Scale would make it more useful or broaden its usefulness to other scientific communities, such as the geological community.


The beginning of the ‘Anthropocene’ is most generally considered to be at c. 1800 CE, around the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Europe (Crutzen’s original suggestion); other potential candidates for time boundaries have been suggested, at both earlier dates (within or even before the Holocene) or later (e.g. at the start of the nuclear age). A formal ‘Anthropocene‘ might be defined either with reference to a particular point within a stratal section, that is, a Global Stratigraphic Section and Point (GSSP), colloquially known as a ‘golden spike; or, by a designated time boundary (a Global Standard Stratigraphic Age).


The ‘Anthropocene’ has emerged as a popular scientific term used by scientists, the scientifically engaged public and the media to designate the period of Earth’s history during which humans have a decisive influence on the state, dynamics and future of the Earth system. It is widely agreed that the Earth is currently in this state.

Back in January of 2008, Barack Obama met with the editorial board of the _San Francisco Chronicle_ and had this to say on the topic of climate change and electricity prices:



“Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket . Even regardless of what I say about whether coal is good or bad. Because I’m capping greenhouse gases…they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.



“They–you–you can already see what the arguments will be during the general election. People will say, ‘Ah, Obama and Al Gore, these folks, they’re going to destroy the economy, this is going to cost us eight trillion dollars,’ or whatever their number is.”



Well, it didn’t turn out that way. Until Gov. Sarah Palin brought it up yesterday, nobody seemed to notice that Sen. Obama had said any such thing. While one can wonder why the Chronicle didn’t play up Obama’s rather bracing statement more than it has–or why what was in plain sight on the Internet for nine months didn’t attract more attention from the blogosphere, print media outlets, or even the McCain campaign itself–one thing is clear: Barack Obama is at least (sometimes) intellectually honest. Sen. McCain–at least on this issue–is not.



Sen. Obama’s frank confession about what his climate change policies will mean to electricity consumers is one very good reason why so many conservative and libertarian intellectuals are gravitating toward his candidacy. It’s not that right‐​wing thinkers necessarily endorse his climate change policies. It’s that right‐​wing thinkers are increasingly tired of Republican hypocrisy and make‐​believe policy fights.



Sen. Obama supports cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. Sen. McCain, on the other hand, proposes a 60% cut in emissions by that same date. It is hard to say what those programs will actually cost because we lack concrete details, and the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions both now and in the future is uncertain. But we know they will cost something.



A reasonably good stab at quantifying likely costs can be found in an analysis performed last April by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In that exercise, the EIA looked at a bill sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman and John Warner to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2050. EIA concluded that the Lieberman‐​Warner bill would increase annual household energy costs by somewhere between $30 and $325 by 2020 and between $76 and $723 by 2030. Gasoline prices in particular would be between 22 and 49 cents per gallon higher than otherwise would have been the case in 2020 and between 41 cents and $1.01 higher in 2030.





Barack Obama is at least (sometimes) intellectually honest. Sen. McCain — at least on this issue — is not.



EIA’s analysis, however, did not look at costs between 2030 and 2050 given that too much is uncertain regarding mitigation costs and emission trends. Separate analysis of the bill by the Environmental Protection Agency found that gross domestic product would, as a consequence, be reduced by somewhere between 1% and 3.8% by 2030 and between 2.4% and 6.9% in 2050.



Of course, there are plenty of other analyses of Lieberman‐​Warner and similar greenhouse gas bills out there–some predicting higher costs, some lower–but before you default to the argument that of course the Bush administration reports greenhouse gas emissions reductions will prove costly, be aware that the EIA has a well‐​earned reputation for politically unbiased analysis and the Bush EPA has, if anything, been more‐​than‐​friendly to the case for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.



It’s also worth noting that lead author Joe Lieberman was quite happy with both the EIA and EPA analyses. “Two separate government analyses have now come to the same conclusion,” he said in a press release when the EIA report came out. “Our bill curbs global warming without harming the U.S. economy.”



Let’s return, however, to the present campaign. If you’re outraged over the costs associated with Barack Obama’s climate change program (which would be a bit more costly than the Lieberman‐​Warner bill), voting for John McCain won’t do you much good. Sen. McCain’s program, which is only a bit less costly than the Lieberman‐​Warner bill, would hit you in the wallet nearly as hard as Sen. Obama’s program, and he would probably bring more Republican office holders along for the legislative ride to boot.



If your job is tied to the coal industry and you worry about Sen. Obama’s statement (also in that audio tape), “If somebody wants to build a coal‐​powered plant, they can; it’s just that it will bankrupt them because they’re going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that’s being emitted,” then you’re right to worry … about either candidate (Gov. Palin’s promise to the contrary notwithstanding).



If you’re disturbed by the fact that hardly anyone is aware of–or prepared for–the higher energy costs that would hit them if Sen. Obama or Sen. McCain were to translate their climate change programs into reality, note that the problem is political candor and, on this score, Barack Obama has more of it than John McCain.



If, on the other hand, you’re excited by Sen. Obama’s climate change plan, ask yourself this: How much would global temperatures go down if we put this plan in place? Computer models suggest that the answer is only a small fraction of one degree Fahrenheit.



Would the economic benefit of reducing global temperatures by that virtually immeasurable amount exceed $238–983 billion by 2030 (EPA’s estimate of the cost of Lieberman‐​Warner that year)? If not, then your legislative enthusiasm is misplaced.



If you’re sick of substantive issues like this getting lost in the national roar regarding tracking polls, campaign strategy and the like, welcome to the club.

"In its first new episode under the presidency of Donald J. Trump, “Saturday Night Live” opened with its vision of the most powerful man in the world  —   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, smirking and chiding Mr. Trump for early missteps  —   followed by a monologue from the show’s host, Aziz Ansari, who commented on issues of race in   America and implored Mr. Trump to directly address them himself. Airing one day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, “S. N. L. ,” which the president hosted as a candidate and has regularly attacked on Twitter, did not feature an appearance from its resident Trump impersonator, Alec Baldwin. Instead the show opened with the cast member Beck Bennett playing a   Mr. Putin and boasting of helping to get Mr. Trump elected. “Today many of you are scared and marching in the streets,” the Putin character said. “You are worried that your country is in the hands of this unpredictable man. But don’t worry. It’s not. Relax. I got this. Putey’s going to make everything O. K. ” He added that Russia would take care of America because “it’s the most expensive thing we’ve ever bought. ” Addressing Mr. Trump directly, he said, “You’re not off to a great start, man. I thought you’d be better at this. However, I’m glad to see so many people showed up to your inauguration. ” The screen then showed video of a crowd of demonstrators on Saturday at the Women’s March on Washington, which was then corrected to an image of the more sparsely populated National Mall on Friday during the Trump inaugural festivities. “Today,” the Putin character said, “you went to the C. I. A. and said one million people came to see you in Washington D. C.? If you’re going to lie, don’t make it so obvious. Say you are friends with LeBron James, not that you are LeBron James. ” Mr. Ansari, the Emmy     and star of the Netflix series “Master of None,” and the first performer of South Asian descent to host “S. N. L. ,” picked up on some of these themes in his monologue. “Yesterday, Trump was inaugurated,” Mr. Ansari said. “Today, an entire gender protested against him. ” Urging Americans to treat each other with respect, Mr. Ansari said that Mr. Trump’s victory had nonetheless empowered a “tiny slice of people that have gotten way too fired up. ” “I’m talking about these people that, as soon as Trump won, they’re like, ‘We don’t have to pretend like we’re not racist anymore!’ ” he said. (In doing so, he gave a fist pump that gradually became a Nazi salute.) “No, no,” Mr. Ansari added. “If you’re one of these people, please go back to pretending. ” Mr. Ansari reflected on the ascent of what he called “this new   K. K. K. movement that started  —   this kind of casual white supremacy,” which includes people who tell him to go back to where he came from, but don’t know his heritage. (“They’re not usually geography buffs,” he said.) “My parents moved from India to South Carolina in the early ’80s,” Mr. Ansari said. “They didn’t move until nine years ago. You know where they moved? North Carolina. They love it here. They’re not leaving. ” He continued: “I think Trump should make a speech. A real speech denouncing the   K. K. K. Don’t tweet about me being lame or the show. Write a speech. A real speech. ” Mr. Ansari pointed out that President George W. Bush made a speech after the Sept. 11 attacks in which he said its perpetrators did not represent Islam. “Everyone applauded  —   Democrats, Republicans, didn’t matter,” Mr. Ansari said. “It was not about politics. It was about basic human decency and remembering why the country was founded in the first place. ” He continued: “I was like, what the hell has happened? I’m sitting here wistfully watching old George W. Bush speeches?” In closing, Mr. Ansari acknowledged that many viewers were likely to be fearful of what the next four years held in store. “If you’re excited about Trump, great,” he said. “He’s president. Let’s hope he does a great job. If you’re scared about Trump and you’re very worried, you’re going to be O. K. too. “Because if you look at our country’s history,” he continued, “change doesn’t come from presidents. Change comes from large groups of angry people. And if Day 1 is any indication, you are part of the largest group of angry people I have ever seen. ” Other segments in the show included a musical   of Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s adviser, where Kate McKinnon played her as Roxie Hart from “Chicago,” and a   to President Obama in which Cecily Strong and Sasheer Zamata serenaded his picture with the title song from “To Sir, With Love. ” Mr. Trump most recently denounced his satirical portrayal on “Saturday Night Live” last week, writing in a tweet: “NBC News is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!” Whether he will comment on the show now that he is in the White House remains to be seen as of early Sunday, he had not done so. On Friday, Katie Rich, a writer for “Saturday Night Live,” was widely criticized for a tweet she posted in which she wrote that Mr. Trump’s    son, Barron, would be “this country’s first homeschool shooter. ” Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the tweet and took down her personal Twitter account."

President Bush’s call yesterday for a dramatic slowdown of green‐​house‐​gas emissions reflects growing concern for the consequences of climate change. But what about the consequences of the world’s response?



The fact is, food riots resulting partly from the United States’ alternative energy policies have arrived at our front door. Crowds of hungry demonstrators swarmed the presidential palace in Haiti last week to protest skyrocketing food prices.



In recent years, we’ve heard that climate change could be catastrophic for nature and humanity. But it’s becoming increasingly evident that over the next few decades, climate‐​change policies could prove even more catastrophic.



Food riots have erupted in Mexico, Morocco, Egypt, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mauritania, Cameroon, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Yemen. Vietnam, Cambodia, India and Egypt have all placed restrictions on their rice exports to drive down domestic prices. Pakistan has reinstated food rationing, which is also under discussion in Bangladesh and rumored in Sri Lanka.





Climate‐​change remedies can lead to greater poverty, starvation and disease, as well as widespread ecological destruction…



Supposedly climate‐​friendly policies in the United States and the European Union — subsidizing the production and consumption of such renewable biofuels as ethanol and biodiesel — have diverted such crops as corn, soybeans and palm oil from food to fuel. This, in turn, has increased prices for food worldwide at a time when the highly populous and newly prosperous East and South Asian countries are demanding more of it.



Together, China and India constitute 40 percent of the world’s population. Not long ago, these countries were on the brink of starvation, but now they’re seeing food demand rise ever higher because of years of near double‐​digit economic growth rates. Energy — critical for making fertilizers, transporting food and running equipment — is at record prices.



According to World Bank data, by March of this year, grain prices had tripled, fertilizer prices had quintupled and energy prices were up 21/​2‐​fold since 2000. Since January of this year alone, food prices have increased a staggering 65 percent.



These food‐​price spikes threaten to undo one of the world’s signal post‐​World War II achievements. In the ‘50s and ‘60s, many feared that famine was inevitable. Instead, we witnessed a vast reduction in chronic hunger, from 37 percent of the developing world’s population in 1970 to 17 percent in 2001 — despite an 83 percent increase in population.



Increased agricultural productivity, trade in food commodities and aid from the developed world resulted in a 75 percent drop in global food prices after 1950, making food available to the bottom‐​rung billions worldwide. The current bump‐​up in food prices threatens to reverse these gains.



The conversion of natural habitat land for produce‐​cultivation purposes had been the single‐​largest threat to biodiversity worldwide, but over the last half century, the global agricultural footprint has nearly stabilized. Now, this achievement is also in jeopardy.



What the US ethanol subsidies do for corn, the European Union’s biodiesel subsidies do for palm oil. EU policies stoke an artificial demand for biodiesel, leading to the clearance of high‐​biodiversity forests in Malaysia and Indonesia. In both the European Union and the United States, lands previously set aside for nature conservation are once again coming under the plow to meet subsidized biofuel demand.



Agricultural expansion, in turn, increases pressures on certain animal species and leads to higher releases of carbon, from biomass and soil above and below ground. Fertilizers used to increase agricultural yields also increase nitrogen discharged into waters and emissions of nitrous oxide — a greenhouse gas that heats the atmosphere 300 times more effectively than carbon dioxide.



Thus, even if biofuels produce an energy surplus, they would not necessarily be environmentally sound. Worse, they harm the US economy. Higher energy and food prices reduce consumers’ disposable income more or less equally, meaning they disproportionately affect poorer people. Higher food prices, alternative energy subsidies and greenhouse‐​gas‐​emissions controls only make it harder for these people to earn a living or afford better education and health care.



Climate‐​change remedies can lead to greater poverty, starvation and disease, as well as widespread ecological destruction — some of the very misfortunes that they’re supposed to prevent. In our haste to address global warming, we have yet to think seriously about our policies’ unintended effects.



The results have been disastrous, and they’re only getting more so.

Petition: Investigate NOAA impartially
No Whitewash!
Friend,
Did government researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tamper with temperature data to boost the global warming campaign?
Dr. John Bates, a climate scientist and former official with NOAA, says they did.

This needs to be fully investigated, but we must not allow climate campaigners to turn this investigation into an exercise in whitewashing.
CFACT is petitioning President Trump to ensure the people investigating NOAA are genuine, impartial outsiders.

Please sign this important petition today and forward it to as many friends as possible.
The climate campaign will use its influence to whitewash improper practices at NOAA, but only if we let them.
Sign the petition and tell the President to find out what’s really been going on at NOAA.
For nature and people too,

"I first heard used the term “biodiversity” as a graduate student some years ago. While it appeared to be something everyone agreed was important, nobody could tell me exactly what it meant. It seemed to mean something different depending on who was using the word. For example, Wikipedia proposes the delightfully vague definition: “Biodiversity is the degree of variation of life forms within a given species, ecosystem, biome, or planet.” Since the days of Darwin and Linnaeus, the number of different species in an ecosystem — what researchers call “species richness” — has dominated the scientific view of global biodiversity patterns. It has long been used as a biological basis for managing vulnerable ecosystems. But merely counting the number of species in a particular place has its limitations. Picture two rockpools on the seashore. Put five species of fish in each one, but one pool has five individuals of each species, whereas the other contains only one individual of four species and 21 of the fifth. Both pools have the same species richness and same abundance of fish, but with an uneven distribution, with the second pool being dominated by a single species. This is a well known problem, and various measures have been developed since the 1940’s to describe how the abundance of species is not by nature evenly distributed. But when we try and apply these over large areas for the purposes of environmental management, we run into difficulties because of the need for directly comparable estimates of species abundance. Usually researchers are forced to use various meta-analytical techniques, incorporating scattered, sometimes incompatible sources of data from studies with varying methodologies. In an effort to overcome the this approach’s potential to introduce bias, researchers at the University of Tasmania have established the Reef Life Survey. This ongoing survey of the world’s coastal reefs uses a combination of professional researchers and trained volunteer divers to collect data of fish and invertebrate abundance using a single, consistent methodology. The project has so far completed over 6,000 surveys at more than 2,000 sites in 40 countries. So, we now have consistently-collected abundance data across a wide range of latitudes, habitats and climates with which to examine biodiversity patterns at the largest scales. But just counting species and their abundance patterns is still a very crude way of understanding diversity. Instead, we gathered information on their traits - what they eat, how they move, where they live. This way we can understand more about how they vary in terms of their function, their ecological niche in the natural working of their ecosystems. It is this, functional variation of species that is the real essence of biodiversity. Returning to our rockpools: imagine that one pool contains a fish, a crab, and a kelp plant. The other contains three species of fish. Which is more diverse? Intuitively, we know it’s the one with the fish, crab, and kelp, although both have the same number of species. In a new global analysis of reef fishes recently published in Nature, we have noted how the members of each species make a living by creating a detailed matrix of “functional traits.” These include what they eat (plankton, invertebrates, algae, other fish, or a combination), how they eat it (browsing, scraping, or predation), where they live (in, on, or near the bottom, attached, or free-swimming), how gregarious they are (solitary, paired, or schooling), and whether they are active at night or during the day. By replacing the identity of or abundance of species with their range of ecological traits, and incorporating how frequently these traits appear, this challenges our perception of where the most biodiverse regions of the globe are. Coral reefs generally possess more fish species than at higher latitudes, but a trait-based view reveals new hotspots of biodiversity in places like south-west Africa and southern Australia - locations well outside the species-rich tropical regions. At scales relevant to resource management, many species do more or less the same or similar things – fulfilling similar functional roles in the ecosystem with only small or subtle differences between them. The loss of a particular species may not imperil the function of the system as a whole. But where only a small proportion of the species share similar traits, we have much higher functional diversity - and ecosystems that are potentially much more vulnerable. We should perhaps be having a harder look at how well higher latitude marine ecosystems – like around the UK – are being represented by no-take marine protected areas. These not only give us the opportunity to see what relatively natural marine ecosystems should look like, but help to protect and reinstate functionally diverse assemblages of species that are susceptible to human influence."
"WASHINGTON  —   The Supreme Court rejected on Monday an appeal from Texas officials seeking to restore the state’s strict voter ID law. As is the court’s custom, its brief order in the case, Abbott v. Veasey, No.   gave no reasons for turning down the appeal. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued an unusual statement explaining that the Supreme Court remains free to consider the case after further proceedings in the lower courts. The Texas law, enacted in 2011, requires voters seeking to cast their ballots at the polls to present photo identification, like a Texas driver’s or gun license, a military ID or a passport. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the law is racially discriminatory. The Texas law was at first blocked under Section 5 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which required some states and localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal permission before changing voting procedures. After the Supreme Court effectively struck down Section 5 in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder, an Alabama case, Texas officials announced that they would start enforcing the ID law. After a   trial in 2014, Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Federal District Court in Corpus Christi struck down the law on Oct. 9 in a   opinion. She said that it had been adopted “with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and that its effect was to disenfranchise “a disproportionate number of   and Hispanics. ” In 2015, a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, vacated part of the ruling concerning the law’s purpose but affirmed the part concerning its effect. Last July, the full Fifth Circuit largely adopted the panel’s distinctions and reasoning, and it returned the case to the trial court to consider an appropriate remedy. Texas officials nonetheless asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court’s ruling immediately. The people and groups challenging the law, the officials said, “presented no evidence that the law resulted in diminished minority political participation or prevented even a single person from voting. ” The challengers responded that about 600, 000 registered voters in Texas, or about 5 percent of all registered voters in the state, lacked the required forms of ID. The law, they said, “disproportionately affects minority voters at a statistically significant rate. ” On Monday, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the case would be better suited for Supreme Court review after the lower courts completed their work. Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, said he was disappointed that the court “did not immediately take our case. ” “Chief Justice Roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for Supreme Court review after further proceedings in lower courts,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement. “Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law. ” J. Gerald Hebert of the Campaign Legal Center, which represents voters challenging the law, said he was pleased that “the justices recognize that this case does not merit review at this time. ” “Texas, which ranks poorly in voter participation, should work to ensure that every eligible voter in the state is able to cast a ballot going forward,” Mr. Hebert said in a statement."
"**People in Hong Kong could face life in jail for breaking a controversial and sweeping new security law imposed by China.**
The legislation came into force on Tuesday but the full text was only revealed hours afterwards.
It was brought in by Beijing following increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement.
Critics say the new law effectively curtails protest and undermines Hong Kong's freedoms.
The territory was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement supposed to protect certain freedoms that people in mainland China do not enjoy - including freedom of speech.
Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security.
Details have been closely guarded and the Beijing-backed politician admitted she had not seen the draft before commenting.
But Ted Hui, an opposition legislator, told the BBC: ""Our rights are (being) taken away; our freedom is gone; our rule of law, our judicial independence is gone.""
The UK, EU and Nato have all expressed concern and anger, while pro-democracy groups have started to disband amid fears of immediate reprisals.
Washington, which also urged Beijing to reconsider, had already begun to end the preferential treatment Hong Kong enjoys in trade and travel with the US, bringing it in line with mainland China.
Full details of the new law only emerged after it had come into effect at about 23:00 local time on Tuesday (16:00 BST).
It applies to both permanent and non-permanent residents. Among the details:
The law will not apply to acts which happened before it came into force.
Under the national security law, many of the acts of protest that have rocked Hong Kong over the past year could now be classed as subversion or secessionâ¦ and punished with up to life in prison.
The city's pro-Beijing leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was long overdue.
Fearing repercussions, political activists are resigning their posts and one pro-democracy protester, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that ordinary people are now deleting posts on social media.
Many people are just stopping talking about politics, and stopping talking about freedom and democracy because they want to save their own lives. They want to save their freedom and avoid being arrested.
One contact of mine, a lawyer and human rights activist, sent me a message shortly after the law was passed. Please delete everything on this chat, he wrote.
The reaction began the moment the law - which was first announced six weeks ago - was signed by China's President Xi Jinping.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong began to quit immediately, fearful of the new law, and the punishment it allows.
According to the South China Morning Post, pro-democracy businesses began clearing away any sign they had once supported the protests.
Joshua Wong, secretary-general and founding member of pro-democracy group Demosisto, warned the city would ""turn into a secret police state"".
""Beijing's promise to the world that Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy is proven to be a lie,"" opposition legislator Ted Hui told the BBC's Newshour programme.
But despite the risks, some remained determined to go ahead with the banned traditional 1 July rally planned for Wednesday, amid reports of large numbers of police descending onto Hong Kong's financial district.
The move also provoked international reaction, with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, saying China had broken the promises it had made to the people of Hong Kong under the terms of the 1997 handover.
He added that the government ""fully"" intends to see through plans to change visa rules, offering millions of people in Hong Kong a way to acquire UK citizenship.
That agreement enshrined the ""one country, two systems"" principle in a document called the Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini constitution - for 50 years.
The Basic Law protects rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - neither of which exist in mainland China - and also sets out the structure of governance for the territory.
Julian Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the UN Human Rights Council that the law ""has clear implications for human rights"".
Mr Braithwaite, speaking on behalf of 27 nations, urged China to reconsider."
"The selection of cars launched and announced at the recent Frankfurt Motor Show underlines how the electric vehicle (EV) is finally showing signs of that long-awaited breakthrough to mass-market appeal. After earlier efforts by Mitsubishi – whose EVs are also marketed by Peugeot and Citroën – and Renault-Nissan, whose combined EV sales have now reached 100,000, BMW is launching the i3. BMW’s effort is not only innovative for being an EV, but also in the novel use of a carbon-fibre body mounted on an aluminium chassis – a world away from mainstream automotive practice. Tesla’s model S is also selling well from its European base in the Netherlands, with the model having just launched in the UK market. The main European market for EVs has long been Norway, with its very generous incentives and around 15,000 EVs. But there has been significant recent growth in countries like France (20,000 EVs), Italy and to a lesser extent Germany (7,500 EVs). The Netherlands (11,000 EVs) meanwhile is actively promoting itself as an ideal location to experiment with EVs, in view of its relatively compact size and rapidly growing charging point network. By comparison, the UK lags behind with around 7,200 EVs, despite efforts to promote increased EV use by London mayor Boris Johnson, and government initiatives such as Plugged-in-Places funding from the Office for Low Emission Vehicles to promote the development of charging infrastructure. The UK has around 1,700 charging stations, making up a charging network of islands with great empty seas between them. Such gaps are often filled by the local authorities – not always well publicised – or by chargers at car dealerships that sell EVs. There is also great discussion about whether to install standard, 240v mains chargers or the much more expensive, three-phase high voltage fast chargers which come in a variety of shapes and sizes that not all vehicles can use. The creation of a standardised plug and socket for charging is sadly lacking, leaving the EV market open to the sort of standards schism seen before in VHS vs Betamax or HD-DVD vs Blu Ray.  One suggestion is to provide some or all of the different interfaces as charging points. Software developers have created phone apps that will help locate the nearest charger - although the connector type is not always shown, nor whether it is already in use when needed. It’s that kind of information that is important, and so is increasingly considered valuable enough in its own right to attract entrepreneurs into the charger market. But the needs of access to space and electricity supply mean that any charger station requires buy-in from numerous organisations such as energy companies, local authorities, or private car park operators. This is frequently a barrier to rolling out new EV infrastructure. A good example of how these barriers have been overcome is the Autolib EV car share scheme in Paris. Autolib is run by the Bolloré Group whose interest in EVs derives chiefly from their battery technology. Bolloré won the tender to create the Autolib scheme in Paris and its 53 fellow local authorities on the Île-de-France in 2011, based on its Bluecar. The municipalities pay €47,000 per station, to be recouped by 2014 from the fee the Autolib scheme pays for the 4-6 parking spaces at each site. Once achieved, profits will be shared with the local authorities. The system software allows users to find a parking/charging space automatically, or via the scheme’s 24-hour call centre. An annual subscription costs €144, with tariffs for shorter periods available from €10 a day, with a small additional rate based on mileage or time. By late 2012 the scheme had more than 13,000 annual subscriptions from a total of 37,000 subscribers. Like London, Paris is not a car-friendly city, but renting through Autolib guarantees a parking space, for example, which can persuade drivers into the scheme. Young people with little access to a car have also become early adopters - 70% of Autolib users are in the 18-34 age group. Autolib shows that when committed public and private interests combine for a common cause, it’s possible to make significant progress toward getting more EVs on the road. However, much of the effort in Europe is still too fragmented and on too small a scale to emulate this example. In London, for example, while EVs have been indirectly supported by exemption from the congestion charge, there has been no joined up policy.  Now that electric cars are becoming increasingly popular and widely available, issues such as “range anxiety”  - the fear of running out of power on the road - are fading into the background, but this leaves the absence of a comprehensive support infrastructure all too obvious."

Two More New Papers Document
No Warming Trend In Antarctica


Image Source: State of the Climate, 2016

For several decades now, Antarctica has not been cooperating with the “global” warming narrative, as the continent as a whole has not been warming.
Several scientific papers have been published recently that document the lack of an anthropogenic warming signal for the Antarctic continent or the surrounding ocean, as well as the dominance of natural variability.

Smith and Polvani (2016) concluded that warming of West Antarctica or the Antarctic Peninsula are predominantly natural.
 “[We] conclude that there is little evidence of anthropogenic SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends … compelling evidence pointing to natural climate variability as a key contributor to the recent warming of West Antarctica and of the Peninsula“

Turner et al., 2016, in a paper entitled “Absence of 21st century warming on Antarctic Peninsula consistent with natural variability,” documented a significant cooling trend for the Antarctic Peninsula since the late 1990s.
“The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer.”


Jones et al. (2016) concluded that (a) there has been no overall warming trend for large portions of the continent in the past few hundred years, (b) the Southern Ocean has been cooling since 1979, and that (c), because of the cooling ocean, sea ice extent has been advancing.  In other words, climate models that assume humans drive Antarctic climate are “not compatible with the observed trends.”
“Most observed trends [over the 36-year satellite data] are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries.  … [C]limate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations“
   

A 2,000-Year Cooling Trend For Antarctica, Uninterrupted By Rising CO2 Levels

Scientific documentation of the dominance of natural variability — and a glaring lack of an anthropogenic forcing signal for Antarctica — continues in 2017.
The PAGES 2k reconstruction crew has just published a comprehensive analysis of the surface temperature trends for the entire continent of Antarctica.  The results do not advance the “global” warming narrative.  Instead, over 20 contributing scientists find that modern Antarctic temperatures are still much colder than they were during first millennium, and the long-term cooling trend has not been reversed on a continent-wide scale even with the onset of an assumed anthropogenic influence within the last century.
In other words, natural variability is the dominant factor influencing the Antarctic climate, not anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

 Stenni et al., 2017
“Within this long-term cooling trend from 0-1900 CE we find that the warmest period occurs between 300 and 1000 CE, and the coldest interval from 1200 to 1900 CE.”
“Our new continental scale reconstructions, based on the extended database, corroborates previously published findings for Antarctica from the PAGES2k Consortium (2013): (1) Temperatures over the Antarctic continent show an overall cooling trend during the period from 0 to 1900 CE, which appears strongest in West Antarctica, and (2) no continent-scale warming of Antarctic temperature is evident in the last century.”

“A recent effort to characterize Antarctic and sub-Antarctic climate variability during the last 200 years also concluded that most of the trends observed since satellite climate monitoring began in 1979 CE cannot yet be distinguished from natural (unforced) climate variability (Jones et al., 2016), and are of the opposite sign [cooling] to those produced by most forced climate model simulations over the same post-1979 CE interval.”
“While changes in the SAM have been related to the human influence on stratospheric ozone and greenhouse gases (Thompson et al., 2011), major gaps remain in identifying the drivers of multi-centennial Antarctic climate variability. For instance, the influence of solar and volcanic forcing on Antarctic climate variability remains unclear. This is due to both the lack of observations and to the lack of confidence in climate model skill for the Antarctic region (Flato et al., 2013).”







“Only for the Antarctic Peninsula is this most recent century-scale trend unusual in the context of natural variability over the last 2000-years.”


New Paper: Antarctic Temperatures ‘Much Warmer’ In 1911-’12 Than Any Time Since 1957

Another new paper indicates that measured Antarctic temperatures during exploratory expeditions in 1911 and 1912 were “much warmer” than they have been at any time since 1957.  In fact, there have “never” been temperatures exceeding the early 20th century warmth of the recorded South Pole daily mean temperatures in the last 60 years.  The 1911/12 temperature anomalies reached “greater than 10°C” (as the enclosed graph below indicates).
This demonstrates that there is nothing unusual or unprecedented about modern temperatures in Antarctica, contradicting claims that modern temperatures are driven by anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Fogt et al., 2017
“At their peak on 6 December 1911, the temperatures measured by Amundsen exceeded -16°C, which represents an anomaly relative to our estimate from ERA-Int climatology [long-term temperature and pressure record] of more than 10°C. … Amundsen’s sledging temperature measurements during this time are much warmer than the hourly and daily mean observations collected at the South Pole station since 1957, even when accounting for the average differences in temperature between Amundsen’s location and the South Pole, which is often colder than nearby areas due to pooling of cold air in the slightly lower elevation (Comiso 2000).”
“The daily mean temperature measured at the South Pole on December 7, 2015 of -19.8°C (max hourly temperature of -18.2°C) is the only comparable warm day before December 11th, otherwise observed South Pole daily mean temperatures have never exceeded -20°C in this portion of early summer.”
“[D]aily maximum temperatures above -20°C occurred for two consecutive days in 2015 and 2012, but these are quite warm exceptions to the normal conditions. In contrast, Amundsen experienced four continuous days with daily mean temperatures exceeding -19.0°C and temperature anomalies from the ERA-Int climatology greater than 10°C [50°F].“

“Notably, there is a large positive spike during summer 1911/12, when seasonal mean pressures rise above 1000 hPa. The reconstruction pre-1957 shows only one other summer with pressures above 1000 hPa, in 1925/26, as discussed in Fogt et al. (2016b), while the direct observations display one summer in 1976/77 when they exceed 1000 hPa. This ranks the McMurdo pressure during the summer of the South Pole races [summer 1911/12] in the top three highest over the last 110 years.”
“When the daily mean temperature anomalies were the highest on February 9th and 10th 1912, more than 8°C and 10°C above the ERA-Int climatological average [long-term temperature record], respectively, Scott writes: ‘Very warm on march and we are all pretty tired. To-night it is wonderfully calm and warm, though it has been overcast all the afternoon’ (Huxley 1913, p.389).”

"**Opening the doors to the UK to as many as around 3 million people from Hong Kong is a big step.**
No one in Westminster tonight would expect anything like that number will move here, to escape the increasingly fraught reality of life in Hong Kong. But the decision is important, and not just for those to whom the UK may now provide sanctuary.
It reflects immediate concern in the government about what has been happening on the streets in that packed, throbbing territory.
But the decision was also fuelled by the legacy of British control there. This kind of citizenship was not offered, despite some calls to do so, at the time when Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997.
Remember that handover took place on the basis that its partial democracy and market economy would be respected. But that's been eroded so visibly in recent years.
It was notable not one MP in the House of Commons spoke against the next phase of Britain and Hong Kong's story being to offer a home to islanders here. Government's decisions are still affected by choices made decades ago.
The decision also reflects a souring of the atmosphere around relations between the UK and China.
It's not that long ago that former Prime Minister David Cameron rolled out not just the red carpet, but the Queen's golden carriage to welcome the Chinese Premier.
We rarely saw the then Chancellor George Osborne happier than on visits to China extolling the virtues of trade.
The balance between the opportunities of doing business and objecting to China's human rights policy was awkward then.
But the dilemma is more acute, not least because a group of Tory MPs, including some up and coming key figures on the backbenches, have joined forces with some of the more traditional 'awkward squad' to oppose close links with China regularly and loudly.
Most prominently they have been concerned about whether the UK government should allow the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a place in building the 5G phone network.
Several of those involved in trying to change the government's minds are increasingly confident that Number 10 will soon find a way of rolling back the firm's participation in the project.
As a group they have organised, and they have some strength in numbers, as a previous rebellion suggested.
One of those involved in the manoeuvrings suggested the government had to be pushed to act on Hong Kong.
China is a vast economic power that can't be ignored. There are areas, such as trade and climate where ministers are keen to cooperate.
And the prime minister, asked just yesterday about it, said that: ""The position is very, very simple: I'm not going to get drawn into Sinophobia because I'm not a Sinophobe.""
But the characteristics of the relationship between the two countries have definitely changed.
In the words of one government source today, the UK approach has not hardened, but ""China's more aggressive preferences have been revealed.""
The government's promise to Hong Kongers comes at a junction in our immigration policy.
It was only yesterday that MPs backed the Immigration Bill that ends freedom of movement - the product of a referendum that was fought on the concept of controlling immigration which, for many voters meant getting the numbers down.
Isn't it a contradiction therefore that the government has sent out this message to potentially several million to come to our shores?
A clash for many perhaps, depending how and when people from Hong Kong arrive here.
But for ministers, the decision is a testament of the principle that the UK out of the EU can make its own decisions about who arrives and who leaves."

Two British committees, one Dutch committee and a US Senate committee have investigated Climategate — the disclosure from emails that scientists at the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of East Anglia University sought to withhold data from and sabotage research publications of other scientists questioning the conventional wisdom on global warming.



The first three committees gave CRU scientists and collaborators — including Phil Jones, Michael Mann, Keith Briffa and Kevin Trenberth — a slap on the wrist without calling them outright frauds. The Minority Staff Report of the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, however, has accused the scientists of (a) obstructing release of damaging data and information, (b) manipulating data to reach preconceived conclusions, (c) colluding to pressure journal editors who published work questioning the climate science ‘consensus’, and (d) assuming activist roles to influence the political process.



Critics have lambasted the supposedly‐​independent inquiry by Sir Muir Russell because he himself is a climate change crusader. He interviewed the CRU scientists but not the climate sceptics whom the scientists were targeting. This has been called “a trial with judge, jury, reporters, spectators and defendant, but no plaintiff. The plaintiff is locked outside the courtroom sitting in the hall hollering and hoping the jury hears some of what he has to say.”



At the end of it all, two things are clear. First, it is fantasy for crusaders to claim that catastrophic global warming is established science: the emails reveal doubts and caveats even among true believers in CRU. Second, the International Panel on Climate Change must disavow its claim made first in 2001 — based on the ‘hockey stick’ graph of Michael Mann using historical tree‐​ring data — that the world is warmer today than ever before.



Tree‐​ring data after 1961 indicate cooling, but actual temperatures show warming. So, Jones resorted to the ‘trick’ of splicing tree‐​ring data up to 1961 with actual temperatures after 1961, thus manufacturing a steadily‐​rising temperature trend in the 20th century. The splicing was dishonest and an insult to science. Yet, the independent inquiry did not condemn it, showing how easily crusader‐​inquirers forgive transgressions that promote their private agenda.



The IPCC needs to revert to the earlier scientific consensus — maintained from its first report in 1990 to 2001 — that the medieval warm period of 800–1,300 AD — well before fossil fuels were extracted — was warmer than it is today.



This is inconvenient for climate crusaders who blame fossil fuels for all warming. But it will provide citizens with basic information they need before deciding whether to spend trillions on combating a problem that may or may not be real.



To throw light on these two issues, it is worth citing some of the emails.



Phil Jones (regarding queries from climate sceptic S McIntyre). “I had some emails with him a few years ago when he wanted to get all the station temperature data we use here in CRU. I hid behind the fact that some of the data had been received from individuals and not directly from Met Services through the Global Telecommunications Service (GTS) or through GCOS.”



Phil Jones to Michael Mann. “And don’t leave stuff lying around on ftp [file transfer protocol] sites — you never know who is trawling them. The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years. If they ever hear there is a Freedom of Information Act now in the UK, I think I’ll delete the file rather than send it to anyone.”



KEITH Briffa. “I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data, but in reality, the situation is not quite so simple. We don’t have a lot of proxies that come right up to date and those that do (at least a significant number of tree proxies) show some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent warming…”



Phil Jones. “The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998. OK, it has, but it is only seven years of data and it isn’t statistically significant .”



On February 13 this year, Phil Jones told BBC that “there has been no statistically significant warming over the last 15 years.”



Kevin Trenberth, UCAR, October 12, 2009, “We can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t .”



Professor Mojib Latif, an IPCC member, recently said, “For the time being, global warming has paused, and there may well be some cooling.” Breaking with climate‐​change orthodoxy, he said North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) cycles were probably responsible for some of the strong global warming seen in the past three decades. The NAO was now moving into a colder phase ( _New Scientist_ , September 2009).



The National Research Council appointed by US Congress concluded that “the substantial uncertainties in the quantitative assessment of large‐​scale surface temperature changes prior to about AD 1600 lower our confidence in this (hockey stick) conclusion compared to the high level of confidence we place in the Little Ice Age cooling and 20th century warming. Even less confidence can be placed in the original conclusions by Mann et al(1999) that the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium.”



Climategate fortifies my own convictions as a critical agnostic on global warming. We know so little about the weather that we cannot predict it five days ahead, let alone one century ahead. This also means we know too little to rule out guesstimates — like the six IPCC scenarios — about a possible catastrophe.



The case for combating global warming rests not on established proof of warming but on insuring against a catastrophe that may not happen. If the public decides to spend a trillion dollars on such speculative insurance, so be it. I doubt if this will happen once people learn that catastrophic global warming is a guesstimate, not proven science.

"**TikTok has said it will quit Hong Kong after China imposed a new security law on the city.**
""In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,"" a spokesman told the BBC.
The company's exit from the city will come ""within days,"" according to the Reuters news agency.
Facebook and Twitter said this week they were ""pausing"" co-operation with Hong Kong police over user information.
The short-form video app was launched by China-based ByteDance for users outside mainland China as part of a strategy to grow its global audience.
The tech company operates a similar short video sharing app in China called Douyin.
TikTok, now run by former Walt Disney executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app's user data is not stored in China.
The company has also said previously that it would not comply with any Chinese government requests to censor content or give access to its users' data, nor has it ever been asked to do so.
However, the controversial national security law in Hong Kong has given Chinese authorities sweeping new powers, raising concerns about data privacy.
The legislation punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.
Critics say it erodes Hong Kong's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region, including freedom of speech.
Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Google and Telegram have all announced this week that they are also making changes to their operations in Hong Kong after the new security law came into force last week.
The tech firms have said they are not processing data requests from the Hong Kong police while they assess the ongoing political changes in the city.
TikTok's decision to stop operations in Hong Kong of its popular video app looks unusual - but is strategic.
The company has struggled to fight off suspicions that it operates under Chinese law, or under the control of Beijing.
Which is why TikTok has been at pains to try to change its global image - and this move could be one more step towards doing that.
TikTok has also consistently said that if asked, it would never hand over data to Beijing - and that it's never been asked for any user data either.
Staying in Hong Kong, under the new law, may make it difficult for it to keep to that commitment.
Its biggest market is India - where it has recently been banned by the Indian government because of a border conflict with China. Analysts say it could potentially lose up to a billion dollars in lost advertising revenue in India.
Which is why it is keen to show that it is not simply a Chinese-owned firm - but a global company that is also an international and responsible social media player.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the national security law imposed by Beijing saying it was not ""doom and gloom"" for the city.
Ms Lam said the law would restore Hong Kong's status as one of the safest cities in the world after pro-democracy protests last year often turned violent.
""Compared with the national security laws of other countries, it is a rather mild law. Its scope is not as broad as that in other countries and even China,"" she said.
The legislation has been heavily criticised globally for undermining freedoms guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreed as part of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Also on Tuesday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that the US is ""certainly looking at"" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok.
""I don't want to get out in front of the President (Donald Trump), but it's something we're looking at,"" Mr Pompeo said.
In response to Mr Pompeo's comments, a TikTok spokesperson said: ""TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the US.
""We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users. We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked."""

As Contributors To Recent Climate Change

The IPCC has long acknowledged that water vapour is the Earth’s most influential greenhouse gas.

“Water vapour is the primary greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. The contribution of water vapour to the natural greenhouse effect relative to that of carbon dioxide (CO2) depends on the accounting method, but can be considered to be approximately two to three times greater.”
— IPCC AR5 Chapter 8, page 666

In the 2007 report, the IPCC reported an increasing water vapour trend during the 1980s to 2000s.


Utilizing the IPCC’s own figures and models (from the 4th report), water vapour’s proportional contribution to the total planetary greenhouse effect reaches a dominating 96%.
In contrast, CO2’s proportional radiative forcing contribution to the greenhouse effect is just 2.7% regardless of the CO2 concentration level.

“Calculation of Radiative Forcing (Warming Effect)   
of Carbon Dioxide At Any Concentration”
Lightfoot and Mamer, 2014
“Figure 7 is FAQ 1.1 Figure 1 from page 96 of AR4 [IPCC, 2007]. It shows the radiation balance for the earth and that the back radiation of all of the greenhouse gases is 324 W m-2. This is the value used to calculate the RF [radiative forcing] of CO2 at 378 ppmv as (8.67/324)/100 = 2.7% back radiation of the total of all of the greenhouse gases. … From Table 1, CO2 accounts for 2.7% of the global warming while all of the other gases [i.e., methane] account for approximately 0.7% for a total of approximately 3.4%. It becomes evident that, on average, water vapour accounts for approximately 96% of the current global [greenhouse effect] warming. This is an important finding because it leads to the conclusion that the factors controlling the average level of water vapour in the atmosphere also control atmospheric temperature.”
“[O]n average, each molecule of CO2 is surrounded by approximately 23 molecules of water vapour at ground level [i.e., water vapour is 23 times more abundant in the atmosphere than CO2]. …  If the warming effect of water molecules and CO2 molecules were the same, then the contribution of CO2 would be (1/22.7) = 4.4% of that of water vapour. But from the previous section, water molecules are 1.6 times more effective at warming than CO2 molecules. Using this value and the ratio of 22.7:1, the contribution of CO2 to warming of the atmosphere is approximately (1/22.7)/1.6 = 2.8% of that of water vapour. As water vapour is approximately 96% of the total RF of all of the GHG, the contribution of CO2 is approximately 4% less than this, i.e., 2.69%. If the average RH were 60%, the contribution of CO2 would be ((1/27.4)/1.32) x 0.96 = 2.65%. For practical purposes, these values are the same as the 2.7% obtained by the quadratic model.”

Cloud Radiative Forcing

In a seminal paper (currently 1,440 citations) published in the journal Science entitled “Cloud-radiative forcing and climate…”, Ramanathan et al. (1989) conclude that the cloud contribution to radiative forcing (both shortwave and longwave) is ten times greater than doubled CO2.

Ramanathan et al., 1989     “The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling.”

Cloud cover changes are significant determinants of the Earth’s top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation imbalance, or how much solar radiative forcing is absorbed by the Earth’s surface (oceans).

Wielicki et al., 2002     “It is widely assumed that variations in Earth’s radiative energy budget at large time and space scales are small. We present new evidence from a compilation of over two decades of accurate satellite data that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) tropical radiative energy budget is much more dynamic and variable than previously thought. Results indicate that the radiation budget changes are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness.”

More cloud cover on a net global scale means less solar radiation penetrates the surface, which leads to a net cooling, and less cloud cover means more solar radiation penetrates into the (ocean) surface, which ultimately leads to net warming trend.   In other words, clouds significantly determine global warming (or cooling) trends.

Graph from Page, 2017

McLean, 2014     “The reduction in total cloud cover of 6.8% [between 1984 – 2009] means that 5.4 Wm−2 (6.8% of 79) is no longer being reflected but acts instead as an extra forcing into the atmosphere… To put this [5.4 Wm-2 of solar radiative forcing via cloud cover reduction between 1984-2009] into context, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report…states that the total anthropogenic radiative forcing for 2011 relative to 1750 is 2.29 Wm−2 for all greenhouse gases and for carbon dioxide alone is 1.68 Wm−2.  The increase in radiative forcing caused by the reduction in total cloud cover over 10 years is therefore more than double the IPCC’s estimated radiative forcing for all greenhouse gases and more than three times greater than the forcing by carbon dioxide alone [from 1750 to present].”

Goode and Palle, 2007     “The decrease in  Earth’s reflectance from 1984 to 2000 … translates into a Bond albedo decrease of 0.02 (out of the nominal value of about 0.30) or an additional global shortwave forcing of 6.8 Wm2. To put that in perspective, the latest IPCC report (IPCC, 2001) argues for a 2.4 Wm2 increase in CO2 longwave forcing since 1850. The temporal variations in the albedo are closely associated with changes in the cloud cover.”

Despite the widely recognized prominence of water vapour and clouds in models of greenhouse forcing, a new paper published in Climate Dynamics fails to even identify either factor as a contributor to global temperature changes during the 1984-2005 period.
Instead, the 5 authors have decided that carbon dioxide (24%) and methane (19%) are the dominant greenhouse drivers of recent temperature variations, and water vapour and clouds apparently no longer assume any role.  Meanwhile, the authors do recognize natural solar forcing factors (17% combined), natural ENSO variability (12%), and volcanic aerosols (23%) as assuming slightly more than half of the responsibility for temperature changes combined since the mid-1980s.

“Quantitative Assessment of Drivers of 
Recent Global Temperature Variability”
Bhaskar et al., 2017
“Quantitative assessment of drivers of recent [1984-2005] global temperature variability … Measurements of greenhouse gases: CO2,  CH4  and  N2O; volcanic aerosols; solar activity: UV radiation, total solar irradiance (TSI) and cosmic ray flux (CR); El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Global Mean Temperature Anomaly (GMTA) made during 1984–2005 are utilized to distinguish driving and responding signals of global temperature variability.”
“Estimates of their relative contributions reveal that  CO2 (∼24%),  CH4 (∼19%) and volcanic aerosols (∼23%) are the primary contributors to the observed variations in GMTA [Global Mean Temperature Anomaly]. While UV (∼9%) and ENSO (∼12%) act as secondary drivers of variations in the GMTA, the remaining play a marginal role in the observed recent global temperature variability. Interestingly, ENSO and GMTA mutually drive each other at varied time lags. … [A]ll the constituents of natural forcings together seem to make contributions equal to the greenhouse gases in the context of recent global temperature variability.”


Methane: A Primary Driver Of Recent Temperature Change?

It would appear rather odd that Bhaskar et al. (2017) would wish to claim, for example, that methane gas has been a significant driver of warming, but at the same time reject water vapour and cloud cover changes as factors affecting global temperatures.
It is likely, though, that the main reason why these authors chose to aggrandize the influence of methane emissions on climate is because it is not currently acceptable to claim that human activity plays only a small role (<25%) in temperature variations.  Therefore, adding methane emissions to the list of anthropogenic  dangerous “greenhouse gases” could bolster the perceived human influence percentage to within “acceptable” ranges (near 50%).
However, recently published scientific papers contravene this approach and indicate that (a) we just don’t have substantial observational evidence yet to attribute cause to a the rise in methane, (b) methane emissions may not have increased recently after all, and (c) human activity (fossil fuel consumption) has not been the “dominant factor” driving the (assumed) increase in methane.

Turner et al., 2017   [press release]  ” We conclude that the current surface observing system does not allow unambiguous attribution of the decadal trends in methane without robust constraints on OH variability, which currently rely purely on methyl chloroform data and its uncertain emissions estimates. … [M]ethane emissions might not have increased dramatically in 2007 after all.  … When atmospheric concentrations of methane increase, it may not be correct to chalk it up solely to an increase in methane emissions”

Ruppel and Kessler, 2017     “[T]here is no conclusive proof that the released methane is entering the atmosphere at a level that is detectable against the [natural] background of ~555 Tg yr−1  CH4 emissions. The IPCC estimates are not based on direct measurements of methane fluxes from dissociating gas hydrates, and many numerical models adopt simplifications that do not fully account for sinks, the actual distribution of gas hydrates, or other factors, resulting in probable overestimation of emissions to the ocean-atmosphere system.”

Nisbet et al., 2016     “The isotopic evidence presented here suggests that the methane rise was dominated by significant increases in [naturally occurring] biogenic methane emissions … [T]he sustained shift to more 13C-depleted values and its significant interannual variability, and the tropical and Southern Hemisphere loci of post-2007 growth, both indicate that fossil fuel emissions have not been the dominant factor driving the increase.”

 A Skeptical Conclusion

CO2’s alleged 24% contribution to temperature changes since the 1980s (Bhaskar et al., 2017) is substantially smaller than most estimates.  NASA’s Dr. Gavin Schmidt, for example, claims that the human contribution to climate changes since the mid-20th century is 110%.
As suggested above, the dubious inclusion of methane as a driver of planetary temperatures may have been added to expand the (perceived) anthropogenic contribution to climate change.
Likewise, Bhaskar et al. (2017) may be tendentiously excluding variations in natural factors like clouds and water vapour in their attribution analysis because they wish to avoid having to explain why the contribution from human activity is modest to negligible for recent decades.
When the results don’t fit the narrative, change the results.

"**China has introduced a new national security law for Hong Kong. The BBC's Michael Bristow takes a closer look at the detail, and what it will mean in practice.**
Lawyers and legal experts have said China's national security law for Hong Kong will fundamentally change the territory's legal system.
It introduces new crimes with severe penalties - up to life in prison - and allows mainland security personnel to legally operate in Hong Kong with impunity.
The legislation gives Beijing extensive powers it has never had before to shape life in the territory far beyond the legal system.
Analysis of the law by NPC Observer, a team of legal experts from the United States and Hong Kong, identified what they consider a number of worrying aspects.
""Its criminal provisions are worded in such a broad manner as to encompass a swath of what has so far been considered protected speech,"" said a posting on its website.
Article 29 is perhaps an example of this broad wording.
It states that anyone who conspires with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government, or the authorities in Hong Kong, could have committed a criminal offence.
Does that include criticism of China's governing Communist Party?
On Wednesday at a media briefing, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was asked to define exactly what the provision means. She was unable to give a clear answer.
Article 55 also contains vague language.
It gives Chinese mainland security operatives the right to investigate some national security cases that are ""complex"", ""serious"" or ""difficult"".
As the NPC Observer team note, these words are ""highly subjective and malleable"".
Human rights organisations have pointed out how the law seems to undermine protections previously offered to defendants.
Trials can be held in secret (Article 41) and without a jury (Article 46). Judges can be handpicked (Article 44) by Hong Kong's chief executive, who is answerable directly to Beijing.
The law also reverses a presumption that suspects will be granted bail (Article 42).
That same provision also appears to suggest there is no time limit on how long suspects can be held. It says only that cases should be handled in a ""timely manner"".
Entire cases - from investigation to judgement to punishment - can be simply handed over to the mainland authorities (Article 56).
Foreign nationals outside of Hong Kong face prosecution under the law (Article 38).
Donald Clarke, writing for the China Collection, a blog focusing on Chinese issues, wrote that a US newspaper columnist advocating Tibetan independence might fall foul of the law.
""If you've ever said anything that might offend the PRC (People's Republic of China) or Hong Kong authorities, stay out of Hong Kong,"" he wrote.
Mr Clarke, of the George Washington University Law School, said the biggest worry was the institutions and processes that the law has established.
The legislation allows China to set up the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong - a mainland Chinese body to be staffed by mainland Chinese personnel.
Article 60 makes it clear that anyone who works there does not have to abide by Hong Kong's laws. They shall not be subject to ""inspection, search or detention"".
As Mr Clarke wrote: ""They are untouchable.""
Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker in Hong Kong, said the aim of China's national security legislation was to ""stun Hong Kong into nothingness"".
""People will be so petrified, so frightened and intimidated, that they wouldn't dare say anything or do anything in opposition,"" she said.
Of course, that is not the view in Beijing.
Zhang Xiaoming, of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said on Wednesday that the law would help return stability to the territory.
It will bring Hong Kong more in line with the laws, procedures and practices of mainland China.
Whether or not you think the legislation was necessary, it is impossible to deny its significance. As Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam put it: this is a turning point."
"FOXBOROUGH, Mass.  —   The N. F. L. likes portraying itself as one big family of owners, players and fans who, despite their differences, come together on game days. Yet at the Super Bowl in Houston in two weeks, the N. F. L. may have no choice but to air a public and profound grudge on national television. If the New England Patriots defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday as they are favored to do and go on to beat either the Atlanta Falcons or the Green Bay Packers for the title, the league commissioner, Roger Goodell, will have to present the Lombardi Trophy to Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the Patriots. The moment would be delicious payback for Kraft, who is still simmering about the   suspension his quarterback, Tom Brady, served as a result of the cheating scandal known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In spite  —   or, perhaps, because  —   of it all, New England went   this season and throttled the Houston Texans last week in its playoff opener. Kraft largely kept quiet while the Brady case played out. But in a recent interview, he made clear that he remains annoyed by how his best player and team were pilloried. “Sometimes, the league really messes up, and I think they really messed this up badly,” he said in a   discussion in his Gillette Stadium office here. “But we’ve all agreed to subjugate our right to disrupt everything”  —   the Patriots declined to fight the league over financial penalties it levied on the team  —   “I mean, we can, but we’re a partnership. There’s jealousy, there’s envy, there’s stupidity. Sometimes, life is unfair, and you have to suck it up and move on and not use it as an excuse. ” Let bygones be bygones? Not quite. Goodell has not been seen at a Patriots home game in two years, and on Sunday, rather than face the wrath of Patriots fans, he will, for the second consecutive week, travel to Atlanta for the N. F. C. Championship game instead. This relationship may have evolved into one of the biggest tests of the diplomatic skills  —   in football and in his larger world of finance and philanthropy  —   that Kraft prides himself on. Never mind that he owns one of the most polarizing teams, one that, while certainly beloved in New England, has failed to attract the kind of passionate national following of the Cowboys or the Packers. Some of the distaste, of course, reflects a jealousy created by their four Super Bowl titles  —   and six appearances in the title game  —   over the last 15 years. But there is also the coach, Bill Belichick, who although most likely headed to the Hall of Fame, is hard to love with his taciturn and grumpy manner in public. Also not helping are a series of scandals, including New England’s spying on the New York Jets in 2007, and another involving a former player, Aaron Hernandez, who was convicted of committing a murder that occurred while he was a member of the team. And Brady and those footballs. So the internet likes to discuss things like “15 Reasons Why People Hate the New England Patriots. ” Kraft, a native of Brookline, Mass. who bought the Patriots 23 years ago for a   $172 million, chalks up such animosity to the team’s success. He has an apartment in Manhattan, and in the years after he bought the team, he would get razzed by people on the street. “They used to be aggressive and nasty, and now they’re more respectful because I think we’ve been able to do pretty well and sustained it,” Kraft said. Still, the friction cuts against the image of affability and reason that Kraft, 75, likes to project. When a New York Times reporter stepped into his office, the first thing Kraft did was hand him two small cartons of eggs from his family farm, assuring him they would be the best he had ever eaten. On his desk facing visitors was a small plaque with the greeting “Shalom Y’all!” The 30 minutes allotted for the interview went on way longer, though some of it was given to asides and   tangents. Kraft, whose billions come primarily from a packaging and paper empire and an assortment of other investments, sidestepped questions about whether winning a Super Bowl would have any extra meaning this year. Until Deflategate, he and Goodell publicly got along well, and Kraft takes pride in his facility for building relationships with a wide range of sports figures, celebrities, politicians and business leaders. One week, Secretary of State John Kerry might join him in his suite, and the next it’s media titans like Rupert Murdoch and Leslie Moonves. Among N. F. L. owners, whose politics tilt Republican, Kraft is among the most loyal donors to Democratic candidates. Yet he, as well as Brady and Belichick, considers   Donald J. Trump a good friend, a tricky relationship in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, which voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin. Kraft said they met 20 years ago when Trump invited him to play golf at his club in West Palm Beach, Fla. “Loyalty is important to me, and he has been a wonderful friend,” Kraft said. “I think one of the great problems in the country today is the working poor, the middle class, that there hasn’t been growth in income on an equal basis, and I really think the policies he’s going to bring to bear are going to be great for the economic side of America. ” It is hard to tell if his association with Trump is costing the team fans, but then, as a team owner and businessman, he is used to being a target. He has had legal fights with business partners, including those with a stake in the land where Gillette Stadium now stands. Patriots fans, too, lashed out at Kraft for not doing more to fight the N. F. L. during Deflategate. Yet he is influential enough in the league that owners and officials prefer to keep their criticisms of him to private conversations. When Kraft and other team owners clash over league issues, it is usually behind closed doors. “We do have dissent and do have things I think you couldn’t help but have,” said the Dallas Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones, who rivals Kraft for influence in the league. “I think Bob has exhibited disagreement, but he’s also very capable of making and influencing change. I’m someone, if he has ideas, I would certainly be a good listener. ” Kraft is still a very   owner, but three of his sons have taken on greater responsibilities with the Patriots and the family’s portfolio of company investments, including a Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution. More and more, Kraft said, he is focusing on strategizing and bringing people together. Like Arabs and Jews. He has sought to broker Middle East conciliation through sports and investments, citing economic interdependence as a unifying agent. Several years ago, Kraft, who is Jewish, operated a packaging company that employed Israelis and Palestinians. He has taken dozens of Christian friends to Israel, including Brady and, in 2015, 19 former N. F. L. players, some of whom were baptized in the Jordan River. Still, though he often portrays himself as a unifier, some people  —   or teams  —   do irk him. Like the Indianapolis Colts. During halftime in a victory over the Miami Dolphins last season, while praising Willie McGinest, a linebacker inducted into the team’s hall of fame that night, Kraft made sure to point out that McGinest was on teams that beat the Colts 16 times in 12 seasons. It was seven months after the Colts first suggested that New England used underinflated balls in the A. F. C. Championship game they lost,  . McGinest said he understood how Kraft could still be offended. “When you take away from somebody’s hard work or everything that goes into winning those types of games, it’s pretty upsetting,” said McGinest, now an analyst for NFL Network. “That’s his baby. Those players are all his. That team, it’s his baby. ” At the Patriots, Kraft  —   and, before her death from cancer in 2011, his wife, Myra  —   has had a reputation for forming lasting relationships with his players and engaging in conversations with them beyond football. The Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin grew close to the Krafts during his three seasons in New England. Martin, who identifies as a Christian, spent some Jewish holidays with the Krafts and so grew to love chicken soup served by Myra Kraft that she would give some to her husband to place in Martin’s locker. “I didn’t deem it as normal,” Martin, who also traveled to Israel with Kraft, said in a telephone interview. “I thought it was something that was very rare. ” Now a businessman himself, Martin cherishes the day during his rookie season, in 1995, when Kraft invited him to a   plant he owned. “Everything has a process to it,” Martin said, explaining the lesson he learned. “And when you neglect the process, you ultimately neglect your ability to be successful at whatever you’re striving for. That’s an experience I’ll never forget. ” Kraft, former players say, is a regular presence in the locker room, where   personnel rarely tread, greeting players, even those who are not stars, by name. Sometimes, he can show a playful,   side. During receiver Donte Stallworth’s first stint in New England, in 2007, he and Randy Moss were leaving the cafeteria on their way to the receivers meeting room when Kraft stopped them in the hallway and handed them a manila folder. Opening it, Moss and Stallworth burst into laughter: Inside was a photograph of Kraft and the rapper 50 Cent sipping mai tais on a beach. “I know you two young men are pretty cool and you guys are young studs,” Kraft told them, according to Stallworth. “I’m an old guy, but I’m not too bad myself. ” Stallworth added: “He doesn’t walk around like he owns the place, even though he does. ” Indeed, Kraft was very at home in his office, which is stuffed with photos, memorabilia and knickknacks. Cradling a big cup of Dunkin Donuts coffee, Kraft spoke about how he had managed to maintain consistent success at the Patriots, whether they win the Super Bowl this year or not. “My job is to keep everyone together, strong big egos, and keep the peace in the family,” he said. Looming large near his desk, propped against a wall, was a painting of Brady."

It was Michael Crichton who first prominently identified environmentalism as a religion. That was in a speech in 2003, but the world has moved on apace since then and adherents of the creed now have a firm grip on the world at large.
Global Warming has become the core belief in a new eco-theology. The term is used as shorthand for anthropogenic (or man made) global warming. It is closely related to other modern belief systems, such as political correctness, chemophobia and various other forms of scaremongering, but it represents the vanguard in the assault on scientific man.
The activists now prefer to call it “climate change”. This gives them two advantages:
   1. It allows them to seize as “evidence” the inevitable occurrences of unusually cold weather as well as warm ones.
   2. The climate is always changing, so they must be right.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump upended America’s traditional, bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious,     Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades. With the stroke of a pen on his first full weekday in office, Mr. Trump signaled that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of his “America First” approach. In doing so, he demonstrated that he would not follow old rules, effectively discarding longstanding Republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and America  —   and that the United States should help write the rules of international commerce. Although the   Partnership had not been approved by Congress, Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama’s signature trade achievement, but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a   region. The deal, which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and Japan in a complex web of trade rules, was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising China. Instead, Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from   countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, also parties to the deal. But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward, and will expand its sway over Asia and beyond. Monday was a busy day for the new president. In addition to abandoning the trade deal, he ordered a freeze on federal government hiring, except for the military and other security agencies. He reinstituted a ban on federal funding for overseas family planning groups that assist or counsel women seeking abortions. He met with congressional, labor and business leaders. And he promised to cut up to 75 percent of federal regulations. Mr. Trump’s decision to scrap the   Partnership, or T. P. P. reversed a   strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War, and aligned him more with the political left. When he told a meeting of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just terminated the pact, they broke into applause. “We’re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it’s going to be reversed,” Mr. Trump told them, saying that from now on, the United States would sign trade deals only with individual allies. “I think you’re going to have a lot of companies come back to our country. ” Mr. Trump may also move quickly to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He is scheduling meetings with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the two main partners in that pact, which was negotiated by President George Bush and pushed through Congress by President Bill Clinton. While Nafta has been a major driver of American trade for nearly two decades, it has long been divisive, with critics blaming it for lost jobs and lower wages. But   advocates said that in canceling the Pacific pact, Mr. Trump lost an agreement that had already renegotiated Nafta under more modern rules governing intellectual property, internet access and agriculture, since both Mexico and Canada were signatories. He also undercut Mr. Obama’s   pivot to Asia and, critics said, essentially ceded the field to China, which was not part of the agreement. “There’s no doubt that this action will be seen as a huge, huge win for China,” Michael B. Froman, the trade representative who negotiated the pact for Mr. Obama, said in an interview. “For the Trump administration, after all this talk about being tough on China, for their first action to basically hand the keys to China and say we’re withdrawing from our leadership position in this region is geostrategically damaging. ” Some Republicans agreed, but only a few would publicly challenge the president. Senator John McCain of Arizona called the decision “a serious mistake” that would hurt America. “It will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the   region at a time we can least afford it,” he said in a statement. The Obama administration negotiated the trade pact for nearly eight years. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other congressional Republicans worked with Mr. Obama to pass legislation granting     authority to negotiate it over Democratic objections. But Mr. Obama never submitted the final agreement for approval amid vocal opposition. The agreement, the largest regional trade accord ever, brought together the United States and 11 other nations in a   zone for about 40 percent of the world’s economy. It was intended to lower tariffs while establishing rules for resolving trade disputes, setting patents and protecting intellectual property. Obama officials argued that it benefited the United States by opening markets while giving up very little in return. In particular, it finally brought the United States and Japan, the world’s largest and   economies, together in a   pact. Mr. Trump’s decision was crushing for Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spent considerable political capital to get the agreement through Parliament, which ratified it Friday. Just hours before Mr. Trump dispensed with it, Mr. Abe told Parliament that Tokyo would lobby the new administration on the merits of the deal. Japan was the last to join the pact, which would give its manufacturers   access to export markets in the United States and other Asian countries, but would bring its automakers into competition with   countries like Mexico. Mr. Abe became a strong enthusiast after making politically painful concessions on agricultural imports that the United States had sought. China, by contrast, welcomed Mr. Trump’s move, although its leaders will probably relish the moment quietly. Given Mr. Trump’s harsh attacks on China and his appointment of a leading China critic, Peter Navarro, to the new post of trade council director, Beijing is bracing for a potentially combative relationship. Victor Shih, an expert on China’s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said withdrawing from the T. P. P. would alter America’s image in the region. “The U. S. will be seen as an unreliable partner both economically and perhaps even in the security arena,” he said. “While some countries in Asia have no choice but to be close to the U. S. others may begin to look to China. ” China has already sought to capitalize by making a push to complete an alternative pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which aims to unite 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India. Australia’s trade minister, Steven Ciobo, said on Monday that other members of the trade pact were exploring whether to create a “T. P. P. minus one,” without the United States. “The T. P. P. offers very material benefits for all parties that signed up for the agreement,” he said in an interview. “It would be a great shame to lose those benefits. Notwithstanding President Trump’s decision, there’s still a lot of merits to capturing those gains. ” If Mr. Trump scrambled coalitions overseas, he did so at home, too. Democrats and labor groups praised his move. James P. Hoffa, general president of the Teamsters union, said Mr. Trump had “taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies. ” Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, said it would “bury the moldering corpse” of the Pacific deal, though she expressed concern about how Nafta would be renegotiated. Some people emerging from the union meeting with Mr. Trump, who won surprising victories in Midwestern labor strongholds, expressed enthusiasm for both his trade action and his promise to build new roads, bridges and other infrastructure. “We just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers,” Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, said. “We will work with him and his administration to help him implement his plans on infrastructure, trade and energy policy, so we really do put America back to work. ”"
"Florida has recently experienced several large sewage spills and the issue is expected to worsen in the state due to its growing population, urban development, the climate crisis and ageing infrastructure that frequently cause existing wastewater systems to fail. For example, between December 2019 to February 2020, more than 230m  gallons of sewage spilled into waterways in Fort Lauderdale, the result of ageing water infrastructure.  State officials called the spills the worst on record in state history, as for years Fort Lauderdale diverted funds for needed sewage repairs and maintenance to other city budget needs. The city faces a $2.1m fine from the state for the series of spills. “A lot of the issues in south Florida with sewage spills has to do with the infrastructure getting very old, much of it is beyond its planned life, usually around 50 years, so there are a lot of cracks in the sewage pipes,” said Dr Rachel Silverstein, a marine biologist and executive director of Miami Waterkeeper. Silverstein explained sea level rise in south Florida raises water tables underground, which frequently covers sewage pipes, infiltrates cracks and can overwhelm the system, resulting in pipe bursts. The pollution from these spills is already having long-lasting impacts on south Florida’s environment. Sewage spills are a common problem facing communities in Florida. Between 2015 and March 2020, there were 13,984 reported sewage spills in the state, according to data obtained from the Florida department of environmental protection (FDEP). The FDEP confirmed the statistics obtained from the data. During this period a staggering 1,658,165,304 gallons of sewage were spilled in Florida, after initial recovery efforts were completed. In 2020, several large sewage spills have occurred around Florida, in addition to the record spills in Fort Lauderdale. In May, 1.8m gallons spilled in Miami-Dade due to heavy rain and clogged items disrupting flow in the area’s wastewater treatment plant. In March, FDEP data shows a sewage spill of over 20 million gallons occurred in Miami-Dade county. Nearly 26m  gallons of untreated sewage was discovered spilling into Sarasota Bay in July. More than 1.2m  gallons spilled in the same bay in Bradenton in June. In August, an unknown amount of sewage spilled on the streets of Fort Lauderdale due to a pipe break. Dr Valerie Harwood, a microbiologist at the University of South Florida, explained there are two categories of concern with sewage spills in the state’s water bodies. Firstly, they introduce pathogenic microorganisms that can harm and infect people, and secondly they can bring excessive nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon that contribute to algal blooms and fish kills. Rapid urban growth in the state is another factor. Florida is the third most populous state in the US at about 21.5 million people, with population growth estimated to average 1.5% a year through 2024. The state’s population has more than doubled since 1980. “Our wastewater treatment plants are closer to capacity, so there is less room for error as we have major storm events. Then because we’re building new developments and have to maintain wastewater collection systems, we don’t put a lot more money into these utilities while we put more strain on them,” said Harwood. Harwood added: “Elected officials need to start thinking about climate change and the anticipated increase of tropical storms, changing rainfall patterns and what we are going to do when we need more capacity for wastewater infrastructure.” Florida’s population boom has coincided with significant changes due to the climate crisis. Since 1950, sea levels in Florida have risen 8in, with rises accelerating in many parts of the state in recent years. The climate crisis is expected to worsen flooding, exacerbate sea level rises and further intensify tropical storms and hurricanes. Florida already regularly experiences issues with toxic algal blooms on coastal waters that kill thousands of marine life, cause respiratory issues for nearby communities and induce beach closures. About 1,686 bodies of water in Florida are currently classified as impaired by the FDEP, largely due to pollution created by humans – and much of which is not adequately tackled. “We’re not getting enough funding, so what we’re seeing is this ageing infrastructure collapse and an increase in sewage spills across the state,” said Jenna Stevens, state director of the policy and action group Environment Florida.  The American Society of Civil Engineers releases an infrastructure report every four years, with its latest report in 2017 noting the funding gap of required investment in replacing and upgrading existing wastewater and drinking water infrastructure throughout the US will continue to grow to $144bn by 2040 unless strategies are implemented to alter current trends. “Back in the 1970s with the Clean Water Act there was a lot of investment in our wastewater systems and that investment has waned particularly from the federal government. There is going to need to be investment to upgrade and maintain it adequately. If we don’t, we’ll see more of what we saw in Florida with millions of gallons of sewage being released,” said Darren Olson, co-chair of the ASCE Committee for America’s Infrastructure and an engineer who specializes in water resources. “You have ageing infrastructure trying to keep up with a changing climate. This problem is going to get worse before it gets better but there are things we can do.” Nationally, the ASCE gave the United States’ wastewater infrastructure a D+, calling for increased public investment, planning and action to meet increasing demands on wastewater treatment systems, and replace or repair ageing and deteriorating infrastructure. “Our infrastructure has a grade most of us would be horrified to bring home to our parents, but that’s what we have. In order to change, we need to make people aware of it and we need to invest in it,” concluded Olson."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his most recent Weekend Summary at Weatherbell Analytics, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi looks at recent North American weather events, for example the warm poles (where very few weather stations exist) and the warm North American February.
Arctic sea ice recovers
Soon after global warming alarmists hollered that the Arctic was in collapse, the conditions there have just swung to the opposite direction with Arctic temperature diving back to normal levels and sea ice expanding back to near the mean of the last decade. Once again we see that this is weather at work and does not really have anything to do with climate.
In fact, NCEP predicts sea ice levels to recover back to normal levels later this year, though Joe Bastardi remains very skeptical on that point.

Arctic temperature plunges as weather pattern changes
Also at the 7:10 mark Bastardi also points out that the Arctic temperature has cooled to the lowest level so far this winter, and that it is also expected to be cool in late summer. What’s behind it? It’s the fickle nature of weather.
Low Arctic sea ice extents are in fact nothing new. Before the satellite era, Arctic sea ice was also at very low levels, observed back in the 1950s…something alarmists avoid bringing up.
While the poles in total are below the mean with respect to sea ice, Greenland snow and ice mass is “way way above normal”, Bastardi says, citing official data:

Image from Weatherbell Weekend Summary.
At the 11:30 mark, Bastardi slams all the bogus predictions of “permanent droughts” made by alarmists and media. These droughts have all since disappeared due to heavy rains which were never supposed to happen again.  Joe explains that the weather system is self-correcting and comments on those who are now trying to blame the mysterious drought-ending rains on climate change:
And then when that happens, they say, well, it rained so hard that it’s climate change. It’s…it’s just looney bin”.
Recently elements of the fake news media have been trying to pin the blame for the warm North American February on climate change. For example German alarmist and climate activist site Klimaretter here writes concerning the warm February on the US east coast: “The anomaly is one of the many signs of a galloping climate change.”
Of course (showing just how hopelessly confused the writers at Klimaretter are when it comes to distinguishing between weather and climate) they ignore that the same region will be turning wintry again in March — just when spring is supposed to be arriving instead:

Cold forecast to delay spring. Image cropped from Weatherbell Weekend Summary.
More signs of a harsh hurricane season
Later Bastardi also mentions that ocean surface temperature patterns are shaping up to lend to a harsh hurricane season, thus supporting the forecast made last month here by David Dilley of Global Weather Oscillations.

"New Zealand’s National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research (NIWA) is responsible for New Zealand’s National Climate Database. This database, available online, holds all New Zealand’s climate data, including temperature readings, since the 1850s. Anybody can go and get the data for free. That was done by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition (http://nzclimatescience.net/) and reported in a recent paper edited by Richard Treadgold.
They found that the raw data, when plotted, showed that New Zealand average temperatures have been remarkably constant, way back to the 1850’s. But the official graph produced by NIWA and provided to the IPCC showed significant “global warming” because the original data has been adjusted and strangely most of the adjustments create the warming trend. The NZCSC paper comments:
“We have discovered that the warming in New Zealand over the past 156 years was indeed man-made, but it had nothing to do with emissions of CO2-it was created by man-made adjustments of the temperature. It’s a disgrace.”
In an interesting coincidence, the original graph was prepared by Dr Jim Salinger when he worked at the Climate Research Institute at the University of East Anglia, which is now the centre of much attention because of what appears to be “adjustments” to CRU data and reports.

"LATE September was a frantic period for New York Times reporters covering the country’s secretive national security apparatus. Working sources at the F. B. I. the C. I. A. Capitol Hill and various intelligence agencies, the team chased several bizarre but provocative leads that, if true, could upend the presidential race. The most serious question raised by the material was this: Did a covert connection exist between Donald Trump and Russian officials trying to influence an American election? One vein of reporting centered on a possible channel of communication between a Trump organization computer server and a Russian bank with ties to Vladimir Putin. Another source was offering The Times salacious material describing an odd   dance between Trump and Moscow. The most damning claim was that Trump was aware of Russia’s efforts to hack Democratic computers, an allegation with implications of treason. Reporters Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers led the effort, aided by others. Conversations over what to publish were prolonged and lively, involving Washington and New York, and often including the executive editor, Dean Baquet. If the allegations were true, it was a huge story. If false, they could damage The Times’s reputation. With doubts about the material and with the F. B. I. discouraging publication, editors decided to hold their fire. But was that the right decision? Was there a way to write about some of these allegations using sound journalistic principles but still surfacing the investigation and important leads? Eventually, The Times did just that, but only after other news outlets had gone first. I have spoken privately with several journalists involved in the reporting last fall, and I believe a strong case can be made that The Times was too timid in its decisions not to publish the material it had. I appreciate the majority view that there wasn’t enough proof of a link between Trump and the Kremlin to write a   story. But The Times knew several critical facts: the F. B. I. had a sophisticated investigation underway on Trump’s organization, possibly including FISA warrants. (Some news outlets now report that the F. B. I. did indeed have such warrants, an indication of probable cause.) Investigators had identified a mysterious communication channel, partly through a lead from   operatives At one point, the F. B. I. was so serious about its investigation into the server that it asked The Times to delay publication. Meanwhile, reporters had met with a former British intelligence officer who was building the dossier. While his findings were difficult to confirm, Times reporting bore out that he was respected in his craft. And of his material that was checkable, no significant red flags emerged. What’s more, said one journalist frustrated with the process, a covert link seemed like a plausible explanation for the strange bromance between Trump and Putin. There were disagreements about whether to hold back. There was even an actual draft of a story. But it never saw daylight. The deciding vote was Baquet’s, who was adamant, then and now, that they made the right call. “We heard about the   communications between the Russians and Trump,” he said. “We reported it, and found no evidence that it was true. We wrote everything we knew  —   and we wrote a lot. Anybody that thinks we sat on stuff is outrageous. It’s just false. ” I don’t believe anyone suppressed information for ignoble reasons, and indeed The Times produced strong work on former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. But the idea that you only publish once every piece of information is in and fully vetted is a false construct. If you know the F. B. I. is investigating, say, a presidential candidate, using significant resources and with explosive consequences, that should be enough to write. Not a “gotcha” story that asserts unsubstantiated facts. But a piece that describes the nature of the investigations, the unexplained but damning leads, with emphasis on what is known and what isn’t. Running every detail of the dossier, as BuzzFeed did, would have been irresponsible. Writing about a significant investigation would not. Weeks after The Times had the goods, Franklin Foer of Slate and David Corn of Mother Jones each took a turn at such   articles. Their stories may not have been precisely what The Times would have done, but they offered a model. If The Times didn’t write about ongoing investigations, it wouldn’t have produced the excellent scoop on Trump associates and Russia that broke Thursday night. Nor would it have so relentlessly documented the F. B. I. ’s pursuit of Hillary Clinton’s emails until all facts were resolved. That investigation was fair game, and so was Trump’s. A wave of readers over the past week have challenged The Times’s decision to sit on its reporting about the dossier. Among them was Michael Russo of Brooklyn, who had this to say: There is an unsettling theme that runs through The Times’s publishing decisions. In each instance, it was the actions of government officials that triggered newsroom decisions  —   not additional reporting or insight that journalists gained. On the server, once the F. B. I. signaled it had grown wary of its importance  —   without giving conclusive evidence as to why  —   the paper backed off. Weeks later, the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, publicly admonished the F. B. I. for being secretive about its probe of Trump. That gave The Times cover to write what it knew about the bureau’s investigation into the bank server. It was the same pattern on the dossier. Only after learning from CNN that Trump and President Obama had been briefed on the document did The Times publish what it had known for months. Its confidence in the material had not changed, nor did its editors know whether the top level briefing meant the government believed the information was true. But the briefing became justifiable cause to publish. In this    game between government and press, the government won.   insights are easier than    decisions. Back then, the media still thought Trump was a weak challenger to Clinton, a   that might have made taking the risk of publishing explosive allegations all the more fraught. But it’s hard not to wonder what impact such information might have had on voters still evaluating the candidates, an issue I chided The Times for not pursuing enough in an earlier column. Would more sources have come forward? Would we already know the essential facts? If the new president was in fact colluding with a foreign adversary, journalists and investigators should feel enormous pressure to conclusively establish that fact. If it is not true, both Trump and the country deserve to have this issue put to rest. Updated at 5:25 p. m. January 21, to include clarifying information on the Times investigation. "

YouTuber **[laowhy86](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvithwOECK5g_19TjldMKw)** , formerly a long-time resident of China, has warned that any notions that the Chinese Communist regime will be brought down by the COVID-19 pandemic are fanciful at best.



While the Chinese Virus is China’s Chernobyl in many important respects, it will almost certainly not be fatally weakening to the Chinese regime in the same way as the nuclear disaster was to the Soviets. In fact, Xi’s thuggish rule will most likely emerge stronger than ever, thanks to its relentless propaganda – propaganda eagerly parroted by useful idiots in the West.



As the rest of the world is struggling to fathom what a post-coronavirus existence may look like, China claims it is on the verge of declaring a ­momentous victory in the “People’s War on COVID-19”.



As with anything coming out of Beijing, there is good reason to doubt this. Not only is it likely that the true extent of the disaster in China has been ruthlessly suppressed, Beijing is already mapping out the propaganda campaign to respond to a second wave of infections.



Meanwhile, Xi’s useful idiots are shouting “We’ve seen the future – and it works!”



China is selling itself as the ­resolute leader of humankind’s “shared destiny”, eyes ahead, with the West left dithering in a delusional past.



China’s propaganda outlets are proclaiming its altruism and generosity in spreading its antivirus expertise and its bounty of masks, testing equipment and other health products to smitten countries around the world, although some of it has been targeted especially at ethnic Chinese populations in foreign lands.



The message of Chinese success is being amplified by international elite supporters such as **Jim O’Neill** , the celebrity former Goldman Sachs economist, who praises the “tough, aggressive” response of China, without referring to instances in places such as Wuhan, where officials welded some of those suffering the virus into their own homes.



Of course, there’s no globalist propaganda show without the UN’s Punch.



This take echoes that of **Christiana Figueres** , who for six years was head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and recently visited Australia to receive the 2020 Sydney Peace Prize’s gold medal for human rights. She previously has praised China’s leaders for “doing it right” because the party’s political system “avoids some of the legislative hurdles seen in countries including the US”.



 **These “legislative hurdles”, of course, are only some of the most hard-won liberties of the post-Enlightenment West.**



It’s all of them — as well as judicial, civil, popular, electoral, or any other infernal type of hurdle. This muscular, brook-no-wimpish-rights-or-accountability-nonsense ethos is now being compared with the claimed weakness of Europe and the US.



But it’s one of Beijing’s dreaded “Three Ts” which give the lie to communist propagandising.



Democratic Taiwan has become a model of success using a very different path — in health control as well as governance. Taiwan moved swiftly and decisively before the end of last year, with the important background of lessons learned from the disaster of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. In place was easily accessed and well-resourced universal healthcare, cutting-edge tech and big data, as well as the “X factor” — widespread trust in government, recently re-elected in a landslide, and equally crucially, mutual trust between citizens[…]



Taiwan, with a similar-sized population to Australia[…] has achieved the exemplary result of only 195 confirmed cases and only two deaths, while remaining cut off from formal ­advice from the World Health Organisation, which insists Taiwan is a mere province of the PRC.



Taiwan health officials say they warned the WHO about the virus in late December, but its concerns were not passed on.



Taiwan is the democratic antidote to globalist authoritarianism.



Long may they stay free of the murderous clutches of Beijing.

The sun drives climate: Spain and Portugal
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Does the sun influence climate? In today’s post we would like to introduce new studies from Spain and Portugal that shed light on this. In February 2017 a tree-ring study appeared in Climate of the Past. It was authored by Ernesto Tejedor et al, who made a temperature reconstruction for the Iberian Peninsula for the past 400 years.
The authors emphasize that the temperature fluctuations fit very well with the fluctuations in solar activity.
Warm phases coincide with periods of high solar activity. In total the region of study warmed up almost 3°C over the past 400 years, which reflects the transition from the Little Ice Age to the modern warm period — see figure below. However there were phases around 1625 and 1800 when temperatures were at today’s levels for a short time.

Temperature curve in the mountain regions of northern Spain over the past 400 years, compared to solar activity. Source: Tejedor et al. 2017.

Temperature variability in the Iberian Range since 1602 inferred from tree-ring records
Tree rings are an important proxy to understand the natural drivers of climate variability in the Mediterranean Basin and hence to improve future climate scenarios in a vulnerable region. Here, we compile 316 tree-ring width series from 11 conifer sites in the western Iberian Range. We apply a new standardization method based on the trunk basal area instead of the tree cambial age to develop a regional chronology which preserves high- to low-frequency variability. A new reconstruction for the 1602–2012 period correlates at −0.78 with observational September temperatures with a cumulative mean of the 21 previous months over the 1945–2012 calibration period. The new IR2Tmax reconstruction is spatially representative for the Iberian Peninsula and captures the full range of past Iberian Range temperature variability. Reconstructed long-term temperature variations match reasonably well with solar irradiance changes since warm and cold phases correspond with high and low solar activity, respectively. In addition, some annual temperature downturns coincide with volcanic eruptions with a 3-year lag.”
Next comes Portugal. Anna Morozova and Tatiana Barlyaeva analyzed the temperature curve of the past 100 years in Lisbon, Coimbra and Porto. Here they found a weak but statistically well supported signal of the 11-year and 22-year solar cycles on the temperature data. In the study’s main text we read:
Weak but statistically significant (bi-)decadal signals in the temperature series that can be associated with the solar and geomagnetic activity variations were found. These signals are stronger during the spring and autumn seasons. The multiple regression models which include the sunspot numbers or the geomagnetic indices among other regressors have higher prediction quality. The wavelet coherence analysis shows that there are time lags between the temperature variations and the solar activity cycles. These lags are about 1–2 years in case of the 11-yr solar cycle as well as in case of the 22-yr solar magnetic cycle (relatively to the solar polar magnetic field observations). These lags are confirmed by the correlation analysis. The results obtained by these methods as well as comparison to results of other studies allow us to conclude that the found (bi-)decadal temperature variability modes can be associated, at least partly, with the effect of the solar forcing.”
Continuing out into the Atlantic Ocean. The Azores islands play an important role in western European weather. In November 2016 Roy et al. in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics looked at the question of whether solar activity could play a role on the well-known Azores highs.
A solar impact on this important weather machine would be of great meaning. And indeed the authors found a significant coupling between the Azores highs and solar activity. The relationship becomes visible foremost when one considers different solar activity characteristic figures, and not only the often used sunspot number. It is becoming increasingly clear that the solar magnetic field plays a just as important role — and brought the needed breakthrough in the case of the Azores.
Time delay effects of 1 to 2 years do have be accounted for. The climate system lags a bit and does not immediately react to every impulse that comes up. Sometimes it takes a little time before the system reacts and adjusts to external factors. What follows is the abstract of the exciting study:
Comparing the influence of sunspot activity and geomagnetic activity on winter surface climate
We compare here the effect of geomagnetic activity (using the aa index) and sunspot activity on surface climate using sea level pressure dataset from Hadley centre during northern winter. Previous studies using the multiple linear regression method have been limited to using sunspots as a solar activity predictor. Sunspots and total solar irradiance indicate a robust positive influence around the Aleutian Low. This is valid up to a lag of one year. However, geomagnetic activity yields a positive NAM pattern at high to polar latitudes and a positive signal around Azores High pressure region. Interestingly, while there is a positive signal around Azores High for a 2-year lag in sunspots, the strongest signal in this region is found for aa index at 1-year lag. There is also a weak but significant negative signature present around central Pacific for both sunspots and aa index. The combined influence of geomagnetic activity and Quasi Biannual Oscillation (QBO 30 hPa) produces a particularly strong response at mid to polar latitudes, much stronger than the combined influence of sunspots and QBO, which was mostly studied in previous studies so far. This signal is robust and insensitive to the selected time period during the last century. Our results provide a useful way for improving the prediction of winter weather at middle to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.”

"Around three billion people in the world, largely in developing countries, rely on fuels like wood and charcoal for cooking and heating in the home. But burning these biomass fuels, not least in confined areas indoors, is bad for their health and also bad for the health of the planet. This week a World Bank study indicated how simple measures could reduce pollution from cooking stoves. Not only would this save a million lives a year but it could also help to reduce global warming. One of the chemical components of soot from burning wood and fossil fuels is black carbon, recognised as one of the principal agents of global warming which especially affects the polar regions. A range of governments, public-private institutions, multinational companies, and NGOs are trying to address this issue. Most proposed solutions involve manufacturing and selling more efficient stoves in developing countries. This would do wonders for the health of those using them and, by extracting energy from the fuel more efficiently, would be more environmentally sustainable too. Solving very practical and everyday issues such as improving the design of kitchen and cooking equipment in developing countries could lead to the achievement of greater targets, such as the UN’s Millennium Development Goals. Using open fires and rudimentary stoves generates a significant quantity of smoke and soot, or particulate matter, creates a serious health hazard, especially to women and children. The amount of biomass required solely for cooking fuel can reach up to two tonnes per family per year. As they usually take up the duty of cooking for the family, women are most affected by the harmful effects of wood-burning stoves, so special efforts to increase education should be aimed at them. Just gathering wood, especially in areas where it is scarce, can be the single most time-consuming aspect of a woman’s day. Guaranteeing access to education to women could potentially have far greater beneficial effects by tackling the issue of gender inequality in many developing countries. Exposure to smoke is associated with diseases such as bronchitis and pneumonia, and the evidence shows that using outdated cookstoves clearly increases the rate of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Worldwide, it is responsible for nearly four million deaths. So improving this would have a significant beneficial impact on the quality of people’s lives. Children are also strongly affected because of their developing bodies and the fact they spend more time in the kitchen with their mothers. The consequences of exposure to smoke can be low birth weight or stillbirth in pregnant woman, just as with the effects of smoking tobacco. So to cut indoor air pollution, the most important steps are to ensure kitchens are well ventilated and use fuels with less harmful emissions. This will require improved kitchen designs. The World Bank supports the idea of improved biomass-burning cookstoves backed by the private sector. However, we wanted to find out whether the citizens of developing countries really need to rely on foreign aid and corporations to tackle this issue. Couldn’t they help themselves, using their own traditional skills and ethno-environmental knowledge, together with better education? In our studies in Pakistan, our measurements of particulate matter revealed how smoke concentrations vary. Just cooking outdoors during the summer substantially reduced particulate matter – at one site this resulted in a halving of PM10 particulate matter concentrations (that of 10 micrometres or less, a tenth the width of a human hair). This research shows that those interventions which focus on improving the design of cooking spaces and stoves will bring environmental benefits. One possible solution to the problem lies in drawing on the traditional environmental knowledge of those in the developing world to design their own sustainable environmental solutions. During our research in Pakistan we found that key steps were to use simple technologies, provide easier access to materials and resources and involve local communities. Structured like this, interventions should be more widely accepted by communities for recognising the economic restrictions and social norms that are limiting factors."
"WASHINGTON  —   Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the White House had put forth “alternative facts” to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd. She made this assertion  —   which quickly went viral on social media  —   a day after Mr. Trump and Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had accused the news media of reporting falsehoods about the inauguration and Mr. Trump’s relationship with the intelligence agencies. In leveling this attack, the president and Mr. Spicer made a series of false statements. Here are the facts. In fact, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized the intelligence agencies during his transition to office and has questioned their conclusion that Russia meddled in the election to aid his candidacy. He called their assessment “ridiculous” and suggested that it had been politically motivated. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about him, Mr. Trump alleged that the intelligence agencies had allowed a leak of the material. “Are we living in Nazi Germany?” he asked in a post on Twitter. Aerial photographs clearly show that the crowd did not stretch to the Washington Monument.  An analysis by The New York Times, comparing photographs from Friday to ones taken of Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, showed that Mr. Trump’s crowd was significantly smaller and less than the 1. 5 million people he claimed. An expert hired by The Times found that Mr. Trump’s crowd on the National Mall was about a third of the size of Mr. Obama’s in 2009. The truth is that it began to rain lightly almost exactly as Mr. Trump began to speak and continued to do so throughout his remarks, which lasted about 18 minutes, and after he finished. There is no evidence to support this claim. Not only was Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd far smaller than Mr. Obama’s in 2009, but he also drew fewer television viewers in the United States (30. 6 million) than Mr. Obama did in 2009 (38 million) and Ronald Reagan did in 1981 (42 million) Nielsen reported. Figures for online viewership were not available. Neither number is correct, according to the transit system, which reported 570, 557 entries into the rail system on Friday, compared with 782, 000 on Inauguration Day in 2013. In fact, similar coverings were used during the 2013 inauguration to protect the grass. The coverings did not hamper analyses of the crowd size. The Secret Service said security measures were largely unchanged this year. There were also few reports of long lines or delays."
"In almost every year since the 1960s, health care spending has grown at least as fast as the overall economy, and often much faster. Health economists have long debated why. Strange as it may sound, how we care for our pets offers some answers. The pet care markets look a little like the market for human health care. Health spending by American households has grown 50 percent between 1996 and 2012. Pet care spending has grown by a similar amount, 60 percent, though from a much smaller base. (Americans spent more than $15 billion on pet health care in 2015, but $3. 2 trillion on human health care.) An estimated 68 percent of households have pets those families with higher incomes spend more, which is also true of human care. And they spend more toward the end of humans’ and pets’ lives alike. The supply of both physicians and of veterinarians has grown at a more rapid rate than overall employment. Since 1996, the number of physicians has grown by about 40 percent. The number of veterinarians is up 100 percent. “These commonalities made us think that something else may be behind the rapid growth in human health care spending,” said Amy Finkelstein, an M. I. T. economist and one of the authors of a recent study on pet care. She, along with her   Liran Einav and Atul Gupta of Stanford, tried to find what that something else could be in their  study on pet health care presented at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Chicago. “We often blame generous insurance and significant public sector involvement, but those are absent from pet care,” Ms. Finkelstein said. Some health economists say generous health insurance and significant government intervention in the health care market promote unnecessary spending. They note the United States spends more of its G. D. P. on health care than other similar advanced economies yet does not exhibit broadly better health outcomes, a sign of inefficiency. But other economists argue that health care is so valuable that we might reasonably spend even more on it than we do today. Which camp is right? The three economists pointed out that, in contrast with the market for human health care, there is much less government involvement in pet care. Pet health insurance is also much less common. More than 90 percent of Americans now have health insurance, an industry that has been with us since before World War II. But only 1 percent of dogs and cats are insured for pet care, a relatively new product. (According to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, the first pet health insurance policy in the United States was written for Lassie, the TV dog star, in 1982.) So the economists’ focus turned to the commonalities. Human and pet health care are both provided by experts  —   doctors and veterinarians  —   who’ve undergone lengthy and expensive training and occupational licensing. That expertise commands high salaries. It also gives them the authority to recommend treatments and tests, the need for which most consumers cannot independently judge. You trust your vet as you would trust your doctor to do what is best, especially when an emotional decision is being made. Both human and pet health care are accompanied by strong emotions, making it hard to rationally weigh the value of options. Moreover, the need for care, whether it is for a pet or a human, is difficult to predict and often urgent, again threatening our ability and willingness to shop for the best deals. Technology plays a role, too. Complex procedures, new pharmaceuticals and   imaging, which drive human health care spending, are no longer uncommon in pet care, increasing those costs. Though routine veterinary visits might cost pet owners only a couple of hundred dollars per year, a serious condition can be very expensive. A dog’s kidney transplant can run $25, 000, and a cat’s cancer treatment can cost $10, 000 or more. Even if such high costs are extremely rare, it is not as uncommon for a pet owner to encounter a $2, 000 to $4, 000 bill at some point, particularly near the end of a pet’s life. “It makes you think that the emotional nature of the treatment decision may be important in explaining high and sometimes heroic    health care spending,” Ms. Finkelstein said, “whether on your dog or on your mother. ” If emotions are in fact driving the higher spending, will it hasten the trend toward more pet insurance? The pet health insurance industry is growing, with total premium volume up about 17 percent in each of the last two years. It’s one of the   employee benefits Delta Air Lines,   Microsoft, U. P. S. and Xerox now offer it. The most common policies cover care for injuries due to accidents, as well as care for illnesses like arthritis or cancer, with monthly premiums starting around $22 for dogs and $16 for cats. But premiums can be higher depending on breed, age and where you live. Some other policies also cover preventive care, like vaccinations. In general, plans won’t cover   conditions, pregnancy and   costs, or animals less than a couple of months old. Typically owners pay 20 percent of treatment costs, with plans picking up 80 percent, though some insurers offer other   options. Is pet insurance a good deal? Consumer Reports explored its value last year and concluded it’s typically not worth the price. Only if your pet has very high care costs will insurance pay out more than you would pay in premiums. According to analysis by Ms. Finkelstein and her Stanford colleagues, nearly   of all pet care costs is spent by just 20 percent of households with pets. This guarantees that most policyholders won’t get back what they pay in. This is true of human health insurance, too, and for the same reason. But the point of health insurance  —   whether for humans or their pets  —   is to protect against the risk of catastrophically high costs, not to make money. Consumer Reports suggests an alternative when it comes to pet care:  . Many pet owners could probably build up several thousand dollars in an emergency fund that could be used to help cushion the blow of unusually high pet care costs. Saving enough to weather a serious, human medical condition that could cost tens of thousands of dollars year after year or more is not something most Americans could do. Though you might reasonably avoid pet care insurance, you really can’t do that with human health insurance. Human and pet health care may have some commonalities, but this isn’t one of them."
"In an article for National Geographic and a forthcoming documentary film, author and birder Jonathan Franzen ponders the slaughter of migratory songbirds around the Mediterranean, and asks how it can be stopped. When the same question was asked 40 years ago, the result was the 1979 EU Birds Directive, the birth of modern pan-European environmental organisations. That Franzen is asking this question again now is significant. It reflects a growing view among European bird conservation networks that the issue demands attention. Europe’s dwindling bird populations may be less able to withstand hunting. By exposing the scale of bird trapping and hunting, Frazen dispels the popular assumption that Malta and Cyprus are the last stubborn outposts of this practice, and draws attention to holidaying hunters (particularly Italians) who head to less regulated countries such as Albania. When the European Union (then the European Community) was created, it was reported that huge numbers of migratory birds, in excess of 500 million, were killed for food and sport. Two informal bird protection committees, one German and one Anglo-Dutch, ensured the issue was included in the First Environmental Action Programme (1973), and helped the European Commission draft the Birds Directive - a clear, simple and powerful legal instrument. The issue of migratory bird hunting nicely fit with the politics of the time. The cross-border, pan-European nature of the problem offered the fledgling environment directorate an issue where it could justifiably claim regulatory competence. The idea of killing tired birds returning to their breeding grounds seemed absurd to scientists and cruel to citizens. As member governments (except France) had existing hunting laws, the Directive could be presented as little more than a coordination of existing policy. In short, the Birds Directive was drafted and negotiated, with little opposition, largely from the input of Europe’s organised bird protection societies. They provided the commission with a conceptual framework written by the eminent British ornithologist Stanley Cramp and grounded in evidence from countries across Europe, and the Directive was given teeth by a European Court of Justice willing to enforce it on member states based on a strict interpretation of the law. In support, the German Committee Against Bird Slaughter used its network of dedicated amateur activists to go out and witness the seasonal hunting of migratory birds, making complaints to the Commission and to local authorities concerning illegalities and police inaction. This technique was adopted by BirdLife, the world’s largest NGO partnership, in Cyprus and Malta, and generates regular publicity that keeps the issue political. There are indications that, 30 years on, migratory bird hunters are ageing and dwindling in numbers - at least in Belgium, France and Italy. But there are concerns that a reinvigorated campaign might generate calls to revise the Birds Directive, which is ageing and considered inflexible by many governments. Croatia (acceded 2013), Montenegro, Bosnia and Albania are in the process of integrating into the EU and all have migratory bird hunting traditions. The Eurozone crisis has provoked feelings of injustice and humiliation in Southern Europe, and the risk is that enforcement of Brussels’ legislation at home may be interpreted as yet another attack on southern identities. Bird hunting might become a symbol of resistance. Franzen’s imagery (and that of photographer David Guttenfelder, who told National Geographic it was “like covering a war”) is shocking, but conservation policymakers and activists need to step back and reflect on how to respond. Simply ramping up established approaches may prove counter-productive.  For sure, there needs to be renewed effort on education – explaining migration, the stresses on wild bird populations, and the science of sustainable hunting - and appeals to people’s sense of morality and fair play. But conservationists also need to recognise that migratory bird-hunting is a nature-based recreation contributing to life-quality in some of the more impoverish areas of Europe. And in many places hunters and trappers are the people who know and care about nature. Do we want to alienate and loose this potential constituency for conservation? To prompt thinking on new ways to govern migratory bird hunting I have outlined the concept of opti-hunting. Old technologies – the gun and trap – cause us to conflate hunting and slaughter. A progressive approach might be to design and introduce technology that enhances the practice of hunting, but avoids killing. The OptiGun is an imagined gun-telescope-app-phone hybrid where a bird “hit” becomes digital data rather than a corpse. A telescope replaces the barrel, a triple-trigger operates focus, zoom and fire, and the gun is loaded with batteries rather than ammunition. As a mobile device the OptiGun would integrate the techniques and skills of hunting with photography, producing images instead of kills to be shared instantly on social networks. The idea might sound fanciful and critics argue that killing is integral to hunting - I am not so sure. The introduction of lightweight binoculars after World War II prompted the rise of bird-watching and bird-protection movements. A new form of “gun” could conceivably generate similarly positive dynamics. Opti-hunting represents positive environmentalism: one that seeks to transform practices through innovation and incentives, rather than through restrictions, regulations and bans."
"The global population is ageing. This is happening at a time when the rate and scale of human-induced environmental change is exceeding critical ecological limits, raising concerns over the consequences for society. Our understanding of the interaction between an ageing demographic and a changing environment is in its infancy. We’ve heard much about the impact an ageing population will have on government spending on health, social services and pensions and the need for people to work longer before retiring. Yet one area that is not sufficiently addressed by the sustainable development agenda is the vulnerability of older people to environmental change. Although comprehensive data is not always available regarding the age breakdown of deaths from flooding, heatwaves, cold snaps, air pollution and storm events, there is increasing evidence to suggest most fatalities occur in vulnerable older people. This is particularly important in developing countries which lack the appropriate policies and frameworks to address the needs of an ageing population. HelpAge International has highlighted the problem, especially in how to meet the needs of older people during natural disasters and emergencies. Environmental threats include long-term exposure to toxic pollutants in air, water or food as well as sudden natural or human-induced shocks, such as heatwaves, flooding and storms. The 2003 heat wave across Europe resulted in an estimated 14,800 deaths in France, of which 70% were people aged over 75. When floods, snowfall and bush fires disrupt services, the knock-on effects on everyday life are felt mainly by older people. Older people are a diverse group and some are physically, financially and emotionally less able to cope than others. This is due to a number of factors such as ill health, income, geographic location, family support and friend networks, quality of public health infrastructure and access to relevant local information. As people grow older their biological strength declines and they are susceptible to age-related chronic diseases, reduced mobility and strength, and loss of sight and hearing. These difficulties are further compounded by loss of income, and loss of a spouse, friends or family. All these factors will determine to what extent an individual’s way of life is disrupted by environmental threats that force them to cope to avoid a decline in their wellbeing. Research by the Stockholm Environment Institute at the University of York together with Simon Fraser University’s Gerontology Research Centre in Vancouver, Canada, highlights the need to raise awareness of the effects of a changing global environment on older people. Researchers undertook an international pilot survey of older people’s attitudes in Australia, Canada, Sweden, USA and UK. The survey, while not completely representative of over 55s in these countries, gives an indication of the attitudes of a sample of older people. The respondents were concerned about the environment, the threat of climate change, and energy and water security. They were pessimistic about planet that their grandchildren and future generations will inherit, and believe environmental problems will have grown significantly by 2050. But respondents expressed limited concern on how climate change will impact their own lives, surprising given their vulnerabilities. The report calls for policies to encourage older people to reduce their personal contribution to environmental change by promoting greener behaviour, especially with regard to home energy use and transport. This could be helped by providing appropriate infrastructure, such as more energy efficient homes, and incentives to allow them to lead greener lifestyles. A 2010 SEI report presented the case for better engagement of older people on climate change. So more needs to be done to ensure people reach later life with sufficient reserves to cope with present and future environmental threats. This will include ensuring they have access to local support networks, health care, information, coping skills and savings. In addition, older people should be encouraged to take part in environmental volunteering. Their knowledge of the local environment, its unique elements or weak points, would mean they could them to play a key role developing local environmental protection strategies. Our social and economic policies need to be shaped by a shared understanding of the ageing of our society and environmental change. We can adapt to each of these separately, but that risks seeking solutions in one area that might have adverse effects on the other. Policies therefore need to be “age proofed” so that they can support older people through their life, minimise the negative impact of environmental change, and harness the contribution older people can make to addressing a changing world."

I’ve written before about the “carbon tariff” debate, and will continue to do so as the Senate gears up to write a climate change bill. Indeed, I have a paper coming out in early September with a fuller analysis of the effects of slapping tariffs on countries in an effort to force them to sign up to international carbon‐​limiting agreements. [Spoiler alert: you’ll be shocked to know that I conclude that using trade measures in climate change policy is possibly illegal under world trade rules, definitely costly to the U.S. economy, and more than likely counterproductive in the efforts to forge a climate agreement (for what that’s worth).]   
  
  
Seemingly unconcerned about the costs of green protectionism, ten Democratic senators crucial to the upcoming Senate vote (long‐​standing protectionists all, with the exception of newbie Al Franken) sent a letter to the White House yesterday, urging President Obama to rethink his (lukewarm) resistance to carbon tariffs. They argue that a dreaded “unlevel playing field” would result from saddling U.S. industries with higher carbon costs while, say, Chinese ones remain unencumbered.   
  
  
You’ll have to wait for my paper for a full examination of those arguments, but in the meantime here’s some excellent analysis of the politics of it all by former Catoite, international trade lawyer, and friend of liberty Scott Lincicome. He assesses the scorecard as follows: 



Pro carbon tariffs — Ten protectionist Senators, the US House of Representatives (in Waxman‐​Markey), France [link added], and Paul Krugman.   
  
  
Anti carbon tariffs — the rest of the world.

"By Cliff Ollier, 2009.
I was lucky enough to be invited to the “Climate Challenge” conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. The aim of this small two-day conference was to throw a challenge to the science of the main Copenhagen conference.  We had a few experts who presented their views and evidence.
Niklas Morner, world expert on sea level, showed that sea levels are not rising at an alarming rate anywhere, including the Maldives and Tuvalu.

I talked about the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The alarmist model of glaciers sliding down to the sea on a base of bedrock lubricated by meltwater is false. They occupy basins and the ice has to flow uphill. The ice-cores, used to determine former temperature and carbon dioxide content, sometimes extend to a depth of 3 km, with stratified ice almost to the base.  They show no melting in Greenland for 105,000 years and Antarctica for 760,000 years. The ice in the accumulation area did not melt for three-quarters of a million years, and is not melting at the surface today.  The ice flows at the base where it is warmed by heat from the Earth, and is unaffected by surface temperatures or carbon dioxide.  Mountain glaciers have been in general retreat since 1895, but some are advancing and there is no simple relationship to temperature or carbon dioxide.
Fred Singer gave an account of global temperatures, which show no cause for alarm. The sun is the dominant control, not carbon dioxide.
Ian Plimer, author of the best-selling sceptic book Heaven + Earth, recounted the history of Earth climate showing there were many times that were hotter and colder that today, and that carbon dioxide was far more abundant at times in the past.
Leighton Steward made the case that CO2 is plant food, and entirely good for the ecosystem.  The natural increase in CO2 over the past century has caused increasing vegetation growth, especially of trees. There are hundreds of actual studies of plant growth in greenhouses where high CO2 levels are maintained, and growth is often increased by about 50%.  If we want to sequester CO2 from other producers we should do it to grow food.
Henrik Svensmark described how the sun controls the Earth’s climate through its effect on cloud formation via cosmic rays. His research took years, was rejected by the orthodox, and proved difficult to get published. It now seems to be the most important climatic discovery for years.
Others spoke on aspects of economics, the history of environmental crusades, and a Danish politician gave us an account of some of the problems of Denmark. Despite building a huge array of windmills, which many feel are ugly and objectionable, wind power only provides 3% of Denmark’s energy, and most has to be bought from neighbours with base power based on nuclear, hydro, or coal energy.
The conference was closed by Lord Monckton, a commanding figure who appears to be fully abreast not only of the science, but also the economics, politics and dirty tricks.  It really was a grand finale.
Plenty reporters covered the conference, but little of it was published. I had about 8 TV interviews, but so far as I know only the BBC one was broadcast, and this is also on Youtube.
The mainstream conference did not refer to our conference at all, and generally ignored science, except for assertions that the last ten years was the hottest ever (which it wasn’t), and that sea levels are rising dangerously (which they are not).
Science has dropped to the slogan level.  The propaganda is shameless and crude, worthy of a Goebbels. For example they repeatedly show steam coming from chimneys with the implication that it is carbon dioxide, when we know that CO2 is an invisible gas. A video made to scare children is utterly disgraceful.
The arguments about climate keep changing. It started with Global Warming, but (despite recent assertions) the Earth has been cooling since 1998. Then it becomes Climate Change.  We all agree that the climate changes, but we disagree on the cause and our ability to control it.  If we are really entering a twenty year cooling associated with Solar Cycle 24 then it is pointless to try to reduce CO2, even if it would do anything.  And finally we have the notion that CO2 is a pollutant, so we need to have carbon trading anyway, regardless of climate.
On top of all this we had (after our conference was over) the demonstrations, smashing windows and burning cars, showing perhaps that scientific arguments can be solved by violence.
In brief science is not involved in the present arguments. The current madness of crowds is more like Nazism, Lysenkoism or the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and scientific arguments have no effect.

"**China has vowed to retaliate after the US ended Hong Kong's preferential trade status and imposed sanctions on officials who crack down on rights.**
President Donald Trump said he was acting because China had taken away Hong Kong's freedom after it imposed a new security law.
Beijing condemned Mr Trump's decision, saying it would impose sanctions on relevant people and entities in the US.
US-China ties have become increasingly strained over a wide range of issues.
Apart from Beijing's actions in Hong Kong, Mr Trump has criticised China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its military build-up in the South China Sea, its treatment of Muslim minorities and massive trade surpluses.
Mr Trump's decision means the end of Hong Kong's special trade status with the US, agreed in 1984 when the territory was still a British colony. Hong Kong is expected to be treated the same as mainland China, meaning its goods could be subjected to additional tariffs.
The controversial security law - which effectively outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since the UK handed back sovereignty to Beijing in 1997.
Mr Trump also said he had signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which passed unanimously in Congress earlier this month and penalises banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the security law.
In a strongly worded statement, China's foreign ministry described the decision as a ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs and said the country would impose retaliatory sanctions to ""safeguard China's legitimate interests"".
""The US attempt to obstruct the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong will never succeed,"" the statement said.
""We urge the US side to correct its mistakes, refrain from implementing the act and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way. China will firmly respond if the US goes ahead.""
Speaking in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Mr Trump said the executive order was intended to ""hold China accountable for its aggressive actions against the people"" of Hong Kong.
""No special privileges [for Hong Kong], no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies,"" said the president, who first announced in May that his administration would begin paring back the territory's special status.
According to a document released by the White House, any dealings in US property by anyone determined to be responsible for or complicit in ""actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Hong Kong"" would be blocked.
It also directs officials to ""revoke license exceptions for exports to Hong Kong,"" and includes revoking special treatment for Hong Kong passport holders.
Mr Trump said the Hong Kong Autonomy Act gave the administration ""powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom"".
After being questioned by a journalist, the president said he had no plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Mr Trump also said his administration held China ""fully responsible for concealing the [coronavirus] and unleashing it upon the world"". His own response to the pandemic has been under scrutiny, as the US has 3.4 million recorded cases, the highest in the world, and more than 136,000 deaths.
The president's policy address digressed into a lengthy political attack on his Democratic presidential challenger, Joe Biden, ranging from trade and immigration to policing and climate change.
It was not a matter of if, but when. Scrapping Hong Kong's special status will mean companies based there will now have to evaluate what this means for them.
Hong Kong is a re-exporting hub, which means that goods that go through Hong Kong to the US but have come from somewhere else - like China for instance - have avoided the tariffs the US has slapped on China.
Now that Hong Kong's special status is gone - mainland Chinese companies may look for another place to send their goods - which would see Hong Kong's port and logistics businesses suffer.
And how much of an impact will this have on American and multinational companies using Hong Kong as a regional hub? Well, as one business consultant told me - the structural reasons for why a company would use Hong Kong as a hub are still there - low tax rates, good geographic location, convertibility of currency.
But perception is reality - and if the perception is that doing business in Hong Kong has become so much more onerous - why not decamp to mainland China or Singapore instead?
With Mr Trump facing an uphill battle for re-election this November, he and Mr Biden have accused each other of being weak on China.
On Monday, the administration condemned China's military build-up in the South China Sea, accusing it of bullying neighbours.
Last Friday, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""phase two"" trade deal with China was in doubt because of its handling of coronavirus, which he called the ""plague"".
The US also officially withdrew last week from the World Health Organization, which Mr Trump had accused of being beholden to China.
Last week, too, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang."
"While the species of the crow family - including jackdaw, magpie, crow, rook and raven - are renowned in myth and legend for their intelligence, a scientific basis for this has been hard to establish. Until, that is, researchers discovered a crow species living on the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia that manufactured tools more complex even than those used by humans’ closest relatives, the chimpanzee. The original report from the 1990s described how the crows’ tool making displayed three characteristics not seen before outside of humans: a high degree of tool standardisation, distinct tool designs that involve obvious imposition of form onto raw material, and the use of hooks. Sharing some traits with those of stone age humans’ tools, this led to a surge of interest in the species. Research over the past ten years has found a great deal of interesting behaviour in New Caledonian crows. They have been shown to make tools out of novel materials, use tools in novel ways to solve physical problems at which our close primate relatives fail, and to solve problems in a way that suggests abstract reasoning. Their impressive problem solving skills appear to be backed up by a relatively large brain, but more important than relative brain size is the neurological hardware inside it. There is some evidence that the crows, like primates, have a relatively large forebrain where most decision making occurs. The crows and certain other birds have distinct cell clusters in the forebrain, consisting of a neuron surrounded by supporting glial cells. The density and distribution of these clusters in the forebrain varies between species, but the New Caledonian crow has a high density of them. If these clusters, as is believed to be the case in humans, play an important role in underpinning cognitive skills, they may help explain the crows’ sophistication. In a new volume on tool use as adaptation from the Royal Society, the New Caledonian crow figures prominently. One study questions whether the birds know that the hooked end of a hooked stick is the functional end. A similar question has been asked in a previous study about the hooks they fashion from screw pine leaves. These have barbed edges, and the crows tear strips from the leaf edge to use as hooked tools to extract small prey hiding in trees. In that study the birds observed did not seem to care if the natural barbs on the edges of the leaf strips were absent or incorrectly orientated, even though a barbless or upside down tool would not do the job of extracting food. In contrast, the crows in the new study paid attention to the hooks, and mostly used the hooked end as the working end, findings which corroborate signs of wear seen on only the hooked ends of stick tools that have been made and used by the crows in the wild. Another study found New Caledonian crows outperformed their more common relative the carrion crow in a task where they had to pull one of two sticks with curved ends to obtain food. Only one of the sticks was in an appropriate position when pulled to rake the food towards the crow. But the New Caledonian crows did worse than their cousins in two general learning tasks which didn’t require making decisions about relationships between objects. This suggests that New Caledonian crows’ complex tool skills are underpinned by adaptations in their brains that specifically enhanced only their capacity to solve object-related problems. Humans have co-evolved with tool use and have adapted to use them efficiently, from recognising how and why tools work to having the appropriate physical requirements - such as opposable thumbs - to make and manipulate them. It’s likely that New Caledonian crows are similar in having developed cognitive adaptations that support their tool-using lifestyle. These may take time to discover, but there is evidence that the crows exhibit both behavioural and morphological peculiarities that may have evolved with their tool use. For example, parents feed their juveniles for an exceptionally long time – often up to ten months. This is rare in birds, and in those species where it occurs (certain seabirds and birds of prey, for example) it’s associated with the need for juveniles to learn complex foraging techniques. Also unusual is the crows’ exceptionally wide binocular vision, with eyes whose range overlaps to the front so they can see forward as well as sideways. Combined with an unusually straight bill, researchers have suggested this allows them to focus more clearly on the tool held in their bills, and manipulate it more exactly. The New Caledonian crow is a valuable living, non-primate species from which to learn about the evolution of tool use in early humans. In contrast to our human ancestors, we can today study both the creature’s intelligence, and the complex tools it creates. As increasing evidence suggests the crow’s tool use is built upon various cognitive, behavioural and physical adaptations, this strengthens the idea that the crows have, like humans, been fine-tuned by evolution to become the remarkable technological specialists that we see today."

Scientists: World likely won’t avoid dangerous warming mark
by Seth Borenstein
(AP) A team of top scientists is telling world leaders to stop congratulating themselves on the Paris agreement to fight climate change because if more isn’t done, global temperatures will likely hit dangerous warming levels in about 35 years.
Six scientists who were leaders in past international climate conferences joined with the Universal Ecological Fund in Argentina to release a brief report Thursday, saying that if even more cuts in heat-trapping gases aren’t agreed upon soon, the world will warm by another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) by around 2050.
That 1.8 degree mark is key because in 2009 world leaders agreed that they wanted to avoid warming of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures have already risen about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), so that 2 degree goal is really about preventing a rise of another degree going forward.
Examining the carbon pollution cuts and curbs promised by 190 nations in an agreement made in Paris last December, the scientists said it’s simply not enough.
“The pledges are not going to get even close,” said report lead author Sir Robert Watson, a University of East Anglia professor and former World Bank chief scientist who used to be chairman of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “If you governments of the world are really serious, you’re going to have to do way, way more.”
If carbon pollution continues with just the emission cuts pledged in Paris, Earth will likely hit the danger mark by 2050, Watson and colleagues calculated, echoing what other researchers have found. They said with just a few more cuts, the danger level might be delayed by 20 years,
In Paris, the countries also added a secondary tougher goal of limiting warming to just another 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (half a degree Celsius) as an aspiration.
There “is no hope of us stabilizing” at that temperature because the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already commits the world to hitting that mark, Watson said.
Watson said a few weeks ago he was in Washington at an event with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and former Vice President Al Gore celebrating the accord as a victory.
“It struck me that this was naive,” Watson said. “This is a real major challenge to stay even close to 2 degrees Celsius.”
That 2-degree danger mark is on a continuum with harmful effects already being felt now at lower warming levels, Watson said. But he added: “As you go more and more above 2, the negative effects become more and more pronounced, more and more severe.”
The report wasn’t published in a scientific journal. Six outside scientists looked at for The Associated Press and said the science behind it was sound and so were the conclusions.
“It is a good summary of what is common knowledge in the climate expert community but not widely appreciated by members of the public and even policy makers,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, head of Earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute in Germany. “So indeed it is a useful reminder notice to the world about what is at stake.”
On Tuesday, scientists at Climate Interactive In Asheville, North Carolina, who weren’t part of the report ran a computer simulation using pledges from the Paris agreement and found that dangerous mark arrives around 2051, said group co-director Drew Jones.

From the report https://www.scribd.com/document/325824016/The-Truth-About-Climate-Change



“There are many signs that the climate is already changing. Yet some think that climate change is only going to happen by the end of the century. Because of this common misunderstanding, the urgency of climate change has been misunderstood by most … Climate change is happening now, and much faster than anticipated. The evidence is what most have been experiencing as unusual weather events, such as changes in average rain patterns leading to floods or droughts, more intense storms, heat waves and wildfires, among others daily examples. Some of these impacts of climate change already had devastating effects on livelihoods, infrastructure and lives.”
…
To stay below 2ºC, CO2  emissions should be net zero by 2060-2075.


Good luck with that.

 **Act Party**



 **Update** :



“The Government has made the right call by moving New Zealand to Alert Level 3 immediately and to Alert Level 4 in 48 hours”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.



“Now is the time for all New Zealanders to support the measures announced by the Prime Minister this afternoon.



“We will take a significant economic hit, but we give ourselves the chance to fully eradicate the virus, save lives, and avoid even greater economic consequences down the road.



“It is up to all of us to do everything in our power to reduce the spread of the virus.



“The Government is making critical, high-stakes decisions with limited information in a fluid situation.



“The role of Parliament in these circumstances is to be supportive and to offer constructive criticism.



“ACT will continue to perform this role as the parliamentary opposition and as a servant of the New Zealand public.”



 **In Last Week’s Free Press**



We outlined three possible options for COVID-19: 



(1) Let it burn through the population until we have herd immunity, 



(2) Lock everything down until there is a vaccine, or 



(3) Tread the middle path of flattening the curve of infection rates. 



However, we have very knowledgeable readers. They pointed out there is a fourth option: eradication. This week, _Free Press_ looks at what that would take, and why we believe the Government is sadly off track for this outcome.  
  
**How Eradication Works**



The virus is not self sufficient, it is a parasite. It needs a host to live in. Its problem is that hosts fight back and gain immunity, so it has to keep finding hosts that aren’t immune. Isolating every host means the virus reaches a dead end wherever it goes. We reach a stage where the virus is literally dead in New Zealand. However, the Prime Minister abandoned this view completely over the weekend when she spoke of the virus spreading slower.  
  
**No-Man’s Land**



The Government’s announcement of a four-level COVID-19 alert system means we are stuck in no-man’s land at level 2. The Government’s approach is to introduce measures in response to contagion rather than to prevent it (for example, schools will close if there’s community contagion). Combining this with low rates of testing, we are potentially in much greater trouble than we realise. This is one of those times when opposition MPs need to offer thoughtful, measured, constructive criticism because we believe the Government is making a major strategic error.  
  
**ACT’s View To Date**



To date, ACT has followed David Seymour’s words to the House on Tuesday: “…what I do know is that [the Government has] to make critical, high-stakes decisions with limited information in a fluid situation. The role of Parliament in these circumstances is to be supportive, to offer constructive criticism and helpful suggestions where applicable…” We have followed Government guidelines in our own activity and supported the Government publicly. We will continue to do that but also continue to offer alternative viewpoints and suggestions in our role as Opposition and as a servant of the New Zealand public.  
  
**The Testing Saga**



ACT has been critical of the Government for not being upfront on the specific issue of testing. Until the middle of last week, tests could only be administered if a person had been in close contact with a confirmed case. Of course, you have to be tested to be confirmed. Initially, the only confirmed cases that could trigger a test were those from overseas. It is likely that the virus has outpaced the testing, and we are only beginning to understand the extent of its true prevalence now that tests are increasing.  
  
**A Gradual, Opaque Backdown**



Then, mid-last week, the Prime Minister told Parliament doctors should test if they wanted to. Except, there are about 4,000 GPs in New Zealand and a limit of 1,500 tests per day. In reality, the average doctor could expect to test a patient every three days. There clearly was or is a limit on testing. The limit is either the materials, the lab space, or the lab staff or some combination of the above. The Government should tell the people, trust the people instead of the opaque back down that occurred last week.  
  
**The Real Rate Of Infection**



The virus incubates for five days after infection and symptoms appear after 11 days, so the virus is always going to be ahead of testing. However, our low rate of testing compounds the problem. Our measure of how many people have COVID-19 probably reflects the fact that we’ve been among the most modest testers, rather than having the most modest prevalence of the actual virus. By extension, it seems incredible to believe community spread is not under way.  
  
**Testing At South Korean Levels**



As of a few days ago, South Korea had tested at five times more per capita than New Zealand. (About 6,000 per million as at 20 March vs. 120 per million as at 17 March. New Zealand has since completed 6,000 in total for five million people). The Government should explain if we can test five times more from now on, and if not, why not. Without proper testing, the Government is flying blind.  
  
**The Government’s Catch Up Approach**



When the Prime Minister said the Government’s approach was ‘go hard and go early’ we trusted her. In hindsight, the Government’s response could be described as playing catch up. Waiting for the evidence to introduce new interventions. Combine this with the fact we’ve been light testers, and the fact the nature of the virus means testing will serve as late-warning anyway, and you have a disaster in the making. By the time the Government moves to its alert level 3 or alert level 4, it will be in response to a runaway outbreak rather than in prevention of one.  
  
**If You Doubt The Catch Up Approach…**



Listen to the Prime Ministers’ address on Saturday at lunchtime. She refers several times to slowing the virus. Eradication is off the menu. What’s more, the new system of four levels is designed to be reactive by its very nature. Restrictions on transmission activity are put in place in response to an uptick in the virus (assuming there is enough testing to detect it) instead of to prevent contagion in the first place. We should have started at level 4 then considered reducing the level rather than waiting for things to get bad.  
  
**Making Decisions With Limited Data**



Nobody really knows what happens next in this story. We know what has happened elsewhere, but New Zealand is different in climate, physical isolation, culture, geography and population density. We may actually be getting lucky without realising it. Perhaps we haven’t found many cases because they just aren’t there. Let’s hope, but let’s also be realistic. With limited information, the imminent outbreak scenario is as likely if not more likely than the more hopeful scenario. Given this scenario, a more aggressive, eradication approach seems more appropriate.  
  
**What About The Economy?**



It’s the economy, stupid, said Bill Clinton. To date, most commentators have seen the trade off as lives for dollars. An eradication approach is far more attractive if it can win on both counts. It would involve a major business relief package so that parents can be home to look after kids. It would be in the order of five per cent of GDP, or $15 billion. Schools would close except as daycare centres for kids with absolutely nowhere else to go. It would involve starting the school holidays three weeks early and reevaluating at the beginning of term three after Easter.  
  
**Preparing For A Recovery**



Under this scenario of the whole country effectively hibernating for three incubation periods, the goal would be total eradication and a restart of business as usual except for foreign visitors at the beginning of May. New Zealand would aim to be among countries that are COVID-19-free and able to resume normal travel within the cordon of such countries.  
  
**The Seasonal Elephant In The Room**



It is too early to say whether COVID-19 is seasonal, or at least to what extent. The course we are on sets us up to lose control of COVID-19 precisely as the weather turns and transmissibility becomes much more frequent. However, given what we know it seems sensible to leave room for the possibility that the last of the golden weather is also our best opportunity for eradication.  
  
**The Alternative To Eradication**



We will face a running battle with outbreaks, moving between alert levels 3 and 4 wreaking havoc and seeing tens of thousands of deaths along with widespread economic destruction and the Government having little left in the tank to do much about it. At that point, people become desperate and social order will become strained as people face a future without jobs, certainty, or the ability to pay their mortgage. That is a scenario that does not bear thinking about, but that we should probably start to think about. We need to think about preserving civil society in New Zealand.  
  
**Why Doctors Are Reacting**



 _Free Press_ knows many doctors. Five have read and approved of this week’s edition in the hours before release. Why are doctors hardline on this? Every New Zealand doctor has done overseas work experience. They tend to make lifelong friendships with their foreign counterparts. They are getting live updates of what’s happening in emergency departments in Washington State, Lombardy, and so on. Doctors not only have medical expertise, they have direct lines into the emergency departments and ICUs of every Western city.  
  
**Will The Government Listen?**



It is likely the Government will not heed any of the above. They are not engaged in any kind of dialogue with the parliamentary opposition. They have offered MPs one 45 minute briefing with Ashley Bloomfield since this saga began. It is likely they will stay their course, and we fervently hope they prove us wrong. However, in the meantime, it is up to all of us to voluntarily do everything in our power to reduce the spread of the virus. If you can keep your kids home, do. If you can work from home, do it. If you can help your neighbours, do it but keep to the two metre rule. Government does not always get it right, and that’s when we fall back on civil society. A vaccine that doesn’t yet exist isn’t our answer to COVID-19. The way we behave and the personal responsibility we take to help ourselves, our neighbours and New Zealand is our best hope at this moment of time.  
  
**Be Like Steve**



 _Free Press_ has seen a note in an Auckland letterbox. “Kia ora!”, it reads. “If you are self isolating, I can support. My name is: Steve. I live locally in: Royal Oak. My number is: 027…” The note goes on to say Steve can help pick up shopping, run errands, or even phone to keep the person company. A simple initiative but a powerful one because it shows how anyone can make a real difference to the situation.

Recent reports were all a‐​twitter with the news: The ocean is warming, the warming is consistent with a bunch of climate models, and this proves what a lout George Bush is on global warming. The first is true, but the second is mainly a result of data manipulation. And the scientific paper that presented this news actually shows that Bush did the right thing on global warming by ditching the Kyoto Protocol.



The paper was written by Sydney Levitus and published in Science magazine. I read Levitus’ paper and I would hope that everyone else who wrote a news story did, too. But it is apparent that either they didn’t, or, if they did, they didn’t look carefully. Levitus has been studying historical records of temperatures in the top 10,000 feet of the ocean. He finds a net rise in the temperature of this layer of approximately 0.11ºC for his study period, 1955–96.



But where the water meets the atmosphere–in the top 1,000 feet–he finds nothing like the temperature changes that should have occurred, at least according to computer models of human influence on the atmosphere. Instead, this portion of the ocean data, as well as other records of global climate, shows an abrupt change in temperature in 1976–77 that climatologists call “the great Pacific climate shift.”



It is so profound that there is no warming between 1955 (the beginning of Levitus’ history) and 1976, or from 1977 through 1996 (the end of Levitus’ history). The same behavior accrues in concurrent weather balloon histories, this time in the layer from 5,000 to 30,000 feet above the sea. And it can also be found in chemical analyses of the makeup of Pacific corals.



In his paper, Levitus’ contends there a strong connection between the temperature history in the deep ocean (10,000 foot) data and predicted warming from climate models. That is, climate models containing not only the warming from human greenhouse emissions, but a highly uncertain cooling from concurrent dusty emissions, the inconstancy of the sun, and cooling from volcanoes. Given the problem with the 1976–77 shift, how can this be? Yet, the connection is so striking, federal climatologist Tim Barnett told the Washington Post that, “We don’t have to do any fancy statistics to beat it out of the data.”



Really? Read the third paragraph of Levitus’ paper: “The ocean heat content curve is based on analyses of 5- year running composites of the historical ocean data”. In other words, succeeding five‐​year averages of the raw data were used, rather than the original stuff, which is dominated by the inexplicable 1976–77 shift. The dramatic shift is left out of the analysis. Barnett’s right, sort of. You don’t have to “beat” the right signal out of the data if you “smooth” it in instead.



For fun, we decided to treat the shallow ocean (1,000 foot) data, which weren’t manipulated to begin with, to the same averaging. Sure enough, the 1976–77 shift disappears and the resultant figures look just like the deep ocean (10,000 foot) data, which resembles the climate models. Proof again that if you torture the data, it will confess to whatever you want.



Every reader should and must ask why it was necessary to alter the data, and why the peer‐​reviewers at Science either didn’t notice this or thought it was okay, or–worst of all–told the editor, who ignored their review. The truth likely is some combination of these three things.



So the real signal in the real data is still the 1976–77 shift.



As noted above, there is no statistically significant warming trend on either side of it. How can a climate model explain this? The sun didn’t suddenly get brighter in 1976. And the three big volcanoes that dominate this study period occurred in 1963 (Mt. Agung), 1982 (El Chichon), and 1991 (Mt. Pinatubo) surely don’t presage a step‐​change in the temperature in one year. The match between the ocean history and the climate models results from human influence on the data rather than human influence on the atmosphere.



Anyway, what’s the crime here? About 0.11º C of ocean warming in 40 years. That’s 0.027ºC per decade, which is several times lower than the initial estimates for ocean warming that got this issue onto the front burner in the first place. The bottom line is that warming of the next 100 years is going to be wimpy. That can be gleaned from another model used in the same paper, which does not have volcanoes and assumes the sun is constant. It gives an ocean warming rate that corresponds to about 0.6ºC in the next 100 years, which translates to a total global warming only around 1.4ºC. This is far from the 5.8ºC making the newspapers these days.



All of this proves the Bush was correct to bomb the Kyoto Protocol. Everyone knew it wouldn’t do anything about warming, and that it would cost a fortune. Now, as shown inadvertently in this new paper, it wasn’t much of a problem anyway. Global warming is something we will adapt to as our technology evolves in concert with our need for large amounts of energy produced in an economical fashion.

Miscellaneous Notes
At time of posting, all 5 monthly data sets were available through September 2016. The NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data runs 2 days behind real-time. Therefore, real daily data through October 29th is used, and the 30th and 31st are assumed to have the same anomaly as the 29th.
October’s global NCEP/NCAR monthly anomaly has dropped to near July’s and August’s (2016) levels. October will be the first month since July 2015 that does NOT set a new record high anomaly for that specific calendar month. I.e. August 2015 was the hottest August in NCEP/NCAR data to that time; September 2015 was the hottest September to that time; October 2015 was the hottest October to that time, all the way through September 2016. NCEP/NCAR data goes back to January 1948.
The graph immediately below is a plot of recent NCEP/NCAR daily anomalies, versus 1994-2013 base, similar to Nick Stokes’ web page. The second graph is a monthly version, going back to 1997. The trendlines are as follows…

Black – The longest line with a negative slope in the daily graph goes back to mid-to-late July, 2015, as noted in the graph legend. On the monthly graph, it’s August 2015. This is near the start of the El Nino, and nothing to write home about. Reaching back to 2005 or earlier would be a good start.
Green – This is the trendline from a local minimum in the slope around late 2004, early 2005. To even BEGIN to work on a “pause back to 2005”, the anomaly has to drop below the green line.
Pink – This is the trendline from a local minimum in the slope from mid-2001. Again, the anomaly needs to drop below this line to start working back to a pause to that date.
Red – The trendline back to a local minimum in the slope from late 1997. Again, the anomaly needs to drop below this line to start working back to a pause to that date.

Paparoa is a NZ vigilante group that lurks in the shadows while conducting a wonky jihad against people it considers to be enemies of the state. Their slogan is “Ko tatou tatou – We are one” but a much better description of who they are and what they do is **he huna tatou** – We are hidden.



As they seek to smear people and damage their lives they are very careful to do it from behind the protection of anonymity. Only one person, **Linda Williams** , has been prepared to put her name to the group, but she has been careful to make sure that there are no photos of her that can be 100% confirmed as being the same Linda Williams who is associated with the group. 



Like many fanatical groups, Paparoa sees itself as heroic, challenging hate while **spying on others and collecting dossiers of information like modern-day Stasi.** The fact that they challenge the so-called hate while hiding behind a metaphorical mask exposes their weakness. If they had the courage of their convictions they would operate openly and honestly. On some level, they must know that what they are doing is dirty and unethical. 



**Simon Murdoch from Hope not Hate in the UK spoke with Linda Williams of Paparoa to find out about the website’s aims**



 **Can you explain what the aims of Paparoa are and what motivated those behind it to create it?**



Tena koutou katoa. Paparoa was created in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque massacre. It was a day of horror that most kiwis will never forget. 51 Muslims were murdered by a lone wolf who had been blinded by the “Great Replacement” theory.



 **We’re not your** **typical antifa collective.** Public outrage was so widespread that a lot of ‘everyday’ people signed on within days. This has given us deep roots into a lot of communities. But working people are more cautious about becoming targets, so **we decided to anonymise everybody.** That is, we’re building a membership-driven organisation with people that don’t (and can’t) know each other! It’s a mind jam at first (how do you keep out infiltrators?) but we’ve found a logistical way through.



A couple of savvy computer folk have also **put together a wiki-style database which we’re using to collect info on people and organisations on the far right, along with social media screenshots and photos.** It’s all so much simpler and cheaper than I’d have ever believed! I’m sure they’d be happy to do the same thing for other collectives, if asked nicely! (You can contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).



 **Many outside of New Zealand were unfamiliar with far-right activity there until the Christchurch attack, was this the case for most New Zealanders also?**



Kiwis have been quiety trained to turn a blind eye on racism. Police don’t collect data on hate crimes, [despite calls](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-newzealand-shooting-intelligence-anal/before-mosque-attacks-new-zealand-failed-to-record-hate-crimes-for-years-idUKKCN1RB0PT) to do so from the Human Rights Commission, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the U.N. Human Rights Council. Spy agencies haven’t been interested either: **there’s not a single mention of right-wing extremism in[ten years of public documents](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/385173/no-mention-of-right-wing-extremist-threats-in-10-years-of-gcsb-and-sis-public-docs).**[…]  




Of course, it never occurs to them that that might be because there are no genuine right-wing extremist groups operating in New Zealand. The terrorist was an Australian after all and even Paparoa thinks that he was a “lone wolf”!



 **Whilst directly targeting Muslims in New Zealand, the Christchurch attack was distinctly international – the killer attempted to garner an international audience, was inspired by far-right ideas from around the globe, and was in contact with the international far right. How do you think groups across the world fighting back against hate can work better to beat this far-right internationalisation?**



[…] I think the answer to your question is data. Large amounts of data. Data drawn from **antifa organisations** and NGOs and amassed to the point where it becomes information. Then more, and better, to the point where it becomes insight and action.



 **The Paparoa site says “Given the current climate in Aotearoa/NZ, most racist groups have disbanded. This means there are a lot of lone wolves out there”. Assuming this is reference to the fallout from Christchurch, could you explain for people unfamiliar with the New Zealand far right how this disbandment occurred?**



There’s not a single white supremacist group still operating in public. They’ve either dissolved, disbanded, or gone totally underground. Websites and social media sites are gone, thousands of shitposts have been deleted, and **members are being monitored and publicly exposed** (we’re proud to be helping in every way we can). **Their guns have been taken off them and many are losing their jobs.  
**  
Every time one of them pokes their head up now, the media and police are all over them. We’re not naive – we know this season is just an anomaly – but when they finally re-emerge under new names there will be a **whole new infrastructure in place to deal with them.**



 **How can people help Paparoa to build this infrastructure?**



Data! If anybody knows of any links between a New Zealander and an international far-right organisation, we need to know about it. Links, references, leads, audio, video, stories, screenshots, photos… we want anything and everything that helps identify these people. You can get info and files to us here: <https://paparoa.org/secure/send-information/>.



In closing, we want to acknowledge all the researchers and activists out there who have worked so hard in this area with so little reward. Respect! Ka kitea he mahi tino pakeke rawa te mahi nei, te whaikorero, ehara i te mahi kai paraoa, he mahi ma te tangata matau _._

"The world’s most ambitious reforestation project, the Great Green Wall of Africa, has covered only 4% of its target area but is more than halfway towards its 2030 completion date, according to a status report. More funds, greater technical support and tighter oversight will be needed if the plan to plant 100m hectares of trees and other vegetation is to be realised, say the authors of the study, which was unveiled on Monday at a meeting of regional ministers. The Great Green Wall was conceived in 2007 by the African Union as a 7,000km (4,350-mile) cross-continental barrier stretching from Senegal to Djibouti that would hold back the deserts of the Sahara and Sahel. Its supporters said it would improve livelihoods in one of the world’s poorest regions, capture carbon dioxide and reduce conflict, terrorism and migration. At the launch of the report, ministers and United Nations officials highlighted the achievements so far: more than 350,000 new jobs, $90m (£70m) in revenues and 18m hectares of land restoration in participating countries. “The Great Green Wall is a new world wonder in the making,” said the UN deputy secretary general, Amina Mohammed. “It shows that if we work with nature, rather than against it, we can build a more sustainable and equitable future.” In terms of the target area, however, progress was far less impressive. After an investment of more than $200m, only 4m hectares have been planted in the past decade. To achieve the 2030 target, more than twice that area will need to be restored every year at an annual cost of $4.3bn. “The time for business as usual is over,” said the African Union’s commissioner for rural economy and agriculture, Josefa Sacko, in a call for more sustainable agriculture, clean energy and water management to deal with the drylands of Africa. The results varied enormously from country to country. Ethiopia, which started reforesting earlier than other nations in the region, is a frontrunner, having reportedly planted 5.5bn seedlings on 151,000 hectares of new forest and 792,000 of new terraces. Other countries have lagged due to different geographies, levels of governance and economic development. Burkina Faso planted 16.6m plants and seedlings and Chad 1.1m, though both nations received more financial support for the project. A major problem is monitoring. Individual nations provide their own estimates, but there are doubts as to how many of the 12m trees planted in Senegal, for example, have survived. “One of the main problems we had was to try to track the project because there is not a good monitoring and evaluation system in place,” said Salwa Bahbah, a research analyst with Climatekos, the firm hired to draw up the report. “We don’t know where the money goes exactly and how it is used.” Some scientists have expressed scepticism about creating walls of trees when grasslands can be more effective in certain regions. Shifting climate patterns have also slowed or reversed the expansion of some deserts. There is also greater political support for investing in soil restoration and water management of productive areas rather than planting trees in remote, sparsely inhabited areas. This has affected the objectives, if not the enthusiasm and effectiveness, of the project. Chris Reij of the World Resources Institute said the modest results until now showed the need for more focus on what has and has not worked. “I’m a fan of the GGW. It’s a very useful initiative, which shows the political will of governments to fight land degradation,” he said. “At the same time I’m quite critical. The original idea of planting a green wall in areas of less than 400mm [of rainfall] to stop the advance of the Sahara has largely been abandoned, although not in the rhetoric.  “It is now much more about creating great green and productive landscapes, even though they don’t express it in these terms. There is a ton of good experience across the Sahel upon which it is possible to build. There are many more smaller and bigger successes than often assumed, which can be scaled.”"
"NEW DELHI  —   At least 36 passengers were killed in a train derailment in southern India on Saturday night, the latest disaster on India’s old and overburdened railway system. Government and medical authorities said that at least 40 additional passengers were injured, several critically, and admitted to hospitals. Rescue workers struggled into the early morning to pull the injured passengers and dead bodies from the engine and nine coaches, the authorities said. The accident took place in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh state in southern India, when the engine and coaches of the Hirakhand Express from Jagdalpur to Bhubaneshwar derailed at 11:15 p. m. according to a statement issued by Indian Railways, the   firm that runs India’s trains. The authorities said the cause was not clear, and Indian Railways announced an investigation. India’s railways, which transport 23 million people a day over more than 70, 000 miles of track, have been neglected for years. In 2014, there were more than 27, 000   deaths in India. In 2012, a committee appointed to review the safety of the rail network cited “a grim picture of inadequate performance largely due to poor infrastructure and resources. ” It recommended many urgent measures, including upgrading tracks, repairing bridges, eliminating level crossings and replacing old coaches with safer ones that would better protect passengers in case of an accident. These remedies came with a hefty price tag: The committee said it would cost some $14 billion over five years to put the railways on safer footing. Still, it advised that the work should proceed “in a   manner with required resources mobilized. ” This was never done. Enku Swamy, the district fire officer for Vizianagaram, said in a telephone interview that rescue agencies took about 40 minutes to reach the accident site, in a remote area close to the border of Odisha state. “Some people died because of a stampede inside the derailed coaches,” Mr. Swamy said. Madan Mohal Nial, 21, a passenger, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he was making the journey to take an exam for a government job when the derailment happened. “We heard a loud noise suddenly, and the train coaches turned upside down,” he said. “Many passengers fell down on me. My left hand got trapped in the window rods and got injured. ” Despite the injury to his arm, he searched the coach twice for his luggage because it contained his educational certificates, he said. He said he was not able to find his luggage and finally had to leave to be hospitalized.   injured passengers were admitted to the nearby Government Area Hospital in Parvatipuram. “Most of the injured suffered abdominal and chest crush injuries, and multiple bone fractures on upper and lower limbs,” Dr. G. Nagabhusana Rao, medical superintendent of the hospital, said in a telephone interview. Indian Railways announced compensation of 200, 000 rupees, about $2, 937, to the families of the dead, and 50, 000 rupees, or about $734, to injured passengers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his grief on Twitter, calling the accident a tragedy. Passenger safety, or the lack of it, has come under scrutiny in India in recent months. In November, more than 140 passengers died in the derailment of passenger coaches near the city of Kanpur. In the weeks after that accident, two more people died in another derailment of passenger coaches in the same stretch of track."
"**A former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who alleged he was tortured in China has been granted political asylum in Britain.**
Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, was detained on a business trip to mainland China for 15 days last August.
Beijing accused Mr Cheng of inciting political unrest amid anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
He denied the charges, telling the BBC he had been beaten and forced to sign false confessions while in custody.
UK government sources said at the time they believed his claims were credible.
Mr Cheng, a supporter of the pro-democracy movement, says he believes it is too dangerous for him to return to Hong Kong, fearing he may be arrested and taken to mainland China once more.
In June, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China had still not provided ""an adequate response"" to the UK's questions over the incident.
Mr Cheng was granted asylum on 26 June. In a press conference on Wednesday, he said he believed he was the first Hong Kong holder of the British National (Overseas) passport, known as a BNO, to receive political asylum.
""I am grateful for the determination and courage shown by the UK government to rescue British nationals,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I also hope my case can be a precedent for other HongKongers to seek for protection.
""Leaving means not an end but a beginning. We will continue the fight against the expanding totalitarianism, and be back to our hometown with true democracy and freedom.""
The UK government confirmed on Wednesday that up to three million Hong Kong residents would be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship in the wake of Beijing imposing a controversial new national security law.
Critics say the law, brought in on Tuesday, will erode the added freedoms granted to the region under the ""one country, two systems"" policy agreed after the UK handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
Mr Cheng was working for the UK embassy in Hong Kong, charged with generating interest in investing in Scotland among the Chinese business community.
But as the 2019 protests began to grow, he also volunteered to collect information on the status of the protests for the consulate - for the purposes of observation.
He went missing on 8 August after being detained at the border on the way back from the Chinese city of Shenzhen.
Mr Cheng says he was held for 15 days during which time he was ""shackled, blindfolded and hooded"", held in stress positions and beaten if he moved.
The questioning focused on his role in the protests. He also said he saw other Hong Kong protesters during his time in custody.
Later, after he had been released, China's state-run broadcaster ran a video showing Mr Cheng confessing to soliciting prostitutes. Mr Cheng says he was forced into making the confession."
"Scientists have hammered home once again the message that climate change is very real and very important. Climate scientists have been saying this for decades, yet carbon emissions worldwide continue to soar. It’s easy to blame governments for not taking stronger action, but this is unfair: many want to go further, but are deterred by political obstacles. The most obvious is political obstruction in national legislatures. The US government has been completely shutdown for two weeks now due to Republican opposition to Barack Obama’s budget. Similarly, in the past Republican opposition in Congress blocked Bill Clinton’s carbon tax, and continues to block Obama’s emissions trading legislation today. This obstacle does not exist everywhere, but where it does governments are powerless. There is also a fear of voter retaliation for higher energy prices. Almost all forms of low carbon energy – renewables and nuclear – are more expensive than energy derived from fossil fuels, at least at present. This means that an increase in the proportion of energy from low carbon sources must lead either to an increase in energy prices or, if subsidies are used to prevent this, to steadily increasing public spending and ultimately higher taxes. Neither are popular. Opposition within government stems in large part from claims that strong climate measures increase costs for business and therefore threaten national competitiveness and economic growth and development. Industries might even relocate to countries that are not increasing business costs in this way. Fostering economic growth is everywhere central to what governments and citizens think governments should do. Governments that fail to keep growth on track are generally punished at the polls by voters concerned about their jobs and living standards. An obstacle in developing countries in particular is a sense of injustice: developed countries have already reaped the economic benefits of using fossil fuels, they point out, and are responsible for most of the greenhouse gases emitted so far, but still refuse to make deep cuts in emissions unless developing countries do too. Other political obstacles are of lesser importance. Climate sceptics, for example, have little real influence despite the attention they are given in the media. It is not belief or otherwise in climate change that can be an election issue, but rather the effects of policies designed to reduce emissions. And in any case, most people believe that climate change is real - even in the US where parties are polarised on the issue. Action may also be discouraged by the knowledge that, China and the US aside, no single country can make a difference. So what can be done?  Political strategies for activist governments that enable them to take more effective action against climate change without incurring significant political damage. We should not expect governments in either developed or developing countries to implement policies that might endanger their prospects of staying in office. Many of these strategies are already widely known. Obama’s use of existing legislation to strengthen national emissions standards after Congress rejected emissions trading, for example, shows how legislative blocks may be circumvented. Factual information on climate change is complemented by moral appeals and glowing descriptions of the opportunities that decarbonising the economy will create. In countries such as Britain the policy path has been smoothed by combining energy and climate policy in a single ministry. One underused strategy is to pursue global, industry-level agreements on climate policy. The idea here is to eliminate the possibility that key industries will abandon countries with strong climate policies by ensuring that all countries have these policies. The strategic advantage is that industry-specific agreements should be easier to reach than global agreements of broader scope. New, more vivid, engaging and plausible stories with more arresting images and metaphors are needed to strengthen the portrayal of climate policies as positive, necessary, attractive and inevitable. A case in point is the effort in the US to liken the required action to the Apollo moon program of the 1960s in order to reframe climate policy as a heroic effort that draws on what is best about America to achieve something that has never been done before. And progress on equipping fossil fuel-fired power stations with the capacity to capture and store the carbon dioxide they produce, which is stymied at the moment by the failure of energy companies to invest, could be facilitated by governments buying stakes in these companies and installing managements committed to building this type of power station. This may seem politically risky, but opinion polls show that in at least some countries voters support public ownership of electricity utilities - which is hardly surprising in view of popular anger over rising energy bills."
"Malcolm Roberts examines the “science” promoted by the UN IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). He comes to these conclusions:

It is clear that IPCC reports are not scientifically prepared and contradict science.
The IPCC ignores natural causes of global warming.
Very few scientists support the IPCC’s core claim and a huge number world-wide oppose the IPCC’s core claim.
There is no evidence human production of CO2 caused global warming.
Many IPCC claims are unscientific.
Many claims of the IPCC are false.
The lack of an effective peer review process and the unjustified dismissal of well-founded comments demonstrates that IPCC reports were written to a predetermined aim to ensure a predetermined outcome.
The science is indeed settled – CO2 is NOT causing global warming!

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
German text translated by P. Gosselin)
We would like to take a look at the oceanic warming of the Atlantic. From the latest Climate4You Newsletter (pdf her) We look at the heat content curve of the last 60 years for the upper most 100 meters of the Atlantic:

Fig. 1: Atlantic heat content curve for the past 60 years (upper 100 meters of the Atlantic water mass). Chart: Climate4You.
Clear to see: Over the past 13 years the Atlantic has not warmed further. The chart shows a large plateau. There was a plateau 1955-1985, followed by a rise, then another plateau starting in 2004.
The current missing warming of the upper layer of the Atlantic was also the subject of publication by Somavilla et al, which appeared in March 2016 in the Geophysical Research Letters. It claims that the heat simply moved from the upper levels to the lower layers of the Atlantic:
Mid-2000s North Atlantic shift: Heat budget and circulation changes
Prior to the 2000s, the North Atlantic was the basin showing the greatest warming. However, since the mid-2000s during the so-called global warming hiatus, large amounts of heat were transferred in this basin from upper to deeper levels while the dominance in terms of atmospheric heat capture moved into the Indo-Pacific. Here we show that a large transformation of modal waters in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) played a crucial role in such contrasting behavior. First, strong winter mixing in 2005 transformed ENA modal waters into a much saltier, warmer, and denser variety, transferring upper ocean heat and salt gained slowly over time to deeper layers. The new denser waters also altered the zonal dynamic height gradient reversing the southward regional flow and enhancing the access of saltier southern waters to higher latitudes. Then, the excess salinity in northern regions favored additional heat injection through deep convection events in later years.”

And if you take a look at the temperature anomaly chart in the paper’s supplement (Fig. S1), you can see how heterogeneous this trend really is. We’ll have to keep an eye on it.
Heat distribution had been already the topic in a paper by Desbruyères et al 2014 in the Geophysical Research Letters:
Full-depth temperature trends in the northeastern Atlantic through the early 21st century
The vertical structure of temperature trends in the northeastern Atlantic (NEA) is investigated using a blend of Argo and hydrography data. The representativeness of sparse hydrography sampling in the basin mean is assessed using a numerical model. Between 2003 and 2013, the NEA underwent a strong surface cooling (0–450 m) and a significant warming at intermediate and deep levels (1000 m to 3000 m) that followed a strong cooling trend observed between 1988 and 2003. During 2003–2013, gyre-specific changes are found in the upper 1000 m (warming and cooling of the subtropical and subpolar gyres, respectively), while the intermediate and deep warming primarily occurred in the subpolar gyre, with important contributions from isopycnal heave and water mass property changes. The full-depth temperature change requires a local downward heat flux of 0.53 ± 0.06 W m−2 through the sea surface, and its vertical distribution highlights the likely important role of the NEA in the recent global warming hiatus.”
We wish to take another look at the mentioned North Atlantic cooling in an up-to-date chart from Climate4You:

This week is not exactly a true open thread… I do have one topic that I’d like to discuss. I’m considering doing a weekly radio show with the same name “Watts Up With That” and I’m interested to hear opinions on the topic.
The idea would be to have a show that would cover topics that we might not cover on the blog and allow interactivity including Callins via Skype, e-mailed questions, and questions submitted in advance.
A few years ago I had done a 24-hour television program to counter Al Gore’s 24 hours of climate reality. While that effort was reasonably successful it required a huge amount of effort to produce. Radio type programs however require far less effort and can be just as effective at communications and equally entertaining if not more. It would be streamed live so that people around the world could listen in, and would be recorded also as a podcast.
While not a sure thing that I will do this, I thought I’d ask readers to see what they thought about it and I welcome any ideas that you might have.
Of course, any other topics within our normal purview are open on this open thread as well.
Thanks for your input and thanks to everyone who commented on my personal note earlier this week. It was very heartfelt and uplifting that I have so many friends around the world.

"On the face of it the British royal family’s commitment to wildlife conservation is unmistakable. Perhaps the most well-known work is that of Prince Charles, who in May co-hosted a meeting on illegal wildlife trade, just one of many of his endeavours that include high level activities on rainforests and considerable work in Britain. Both his father Prince Philip, who co-founded the WWF, and his son Prince William (now the Duke of Cambridge), are actively involved in global conservation. Indeed Prince William recently retired from his role as a RAF helicopter pilot to focus on his charity work, launching the United for Wildlife conservation alliance. Less well known is that Princess Michael of Kent is a patron of the George Adamson Wildlife Preservation Trust, Mark Shand (the brother of Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles’ wife) set up the charity Elephant Family, and Prince Andrew has visited game reservation areas in Tanzania. But their work is far more than just supporting and establishing charitable activities. What the royal family has done historically and continues to do for conservation in Britain is to drive a particular vision of what conservation should be, an influence that continues to this day. We need to be careful. Any conservation vision is also inherently a social vision. Any battle for wildlife is a battle fought between people, which means people as well as animals will be among the casualties. The royal family is no stranger to these dilemmas and has found itself embroiled in controversy in the past. For example, when a WWF helicopter donated by Prince Philip was used in a shoot-to-kill anti-poaching operation in Sapi safari area in Zimbabwe in the 1980s. The helicopter was quickly withdrawn, but left a PR disaster for the WWF and its royal benefactors. This is one of the problems of conservation visions, particularly in those overseas issues with which the royal family is associated. On the one hand, it can gloss over the power relations and responsibilities entailed when Britons take an interest in overseas conservation. For example, as patron of the Tusk Trust Prince William said last year, “Africa’s natural heritage is the world’s natural heritage. We have to preserve places like this… not just for us, but for future generations.” Preserving African landscapes for “us” essentially meant wealthy Britons, for they were the audience. But whose lands are they? If they are part of the world’s heritage, then who in the world gave the Prince William the responsibility to lead conservation efforts? This is the sort of thinking which raises hackles and leads to phrases like “new imperialism”. On the other hand it can promote particular ideas of what Africa should look like, and where wilderness should be, that obscures the complex, messy politics behind the practicalities of conservation.  


The future King Edward VIII at a tiger shoot in Nepal during his Indian tour of 1921.

 Work with wildlife charities is a mark of respectability, like working with children’s charities or supporting a hospital. It seems apolitical and is unlikely to ruffle any government feathers. Who could argue with wanting to save the elephants or tigers? Well, the national park in Tanzania that Princess Michael of Kent’s charity supports was cleared of several thousand residents by an illegally conducted eviction – but you would be hard put to find details of that from the organisation involved. And the reserve that Prince Andrew visited (a hunting preserve) has since been at the centre of an only recently resolved dispute over evicting thousands more pastoralists. Let us not forget the royal family is privileged. It moves in privileged circles - indeed, it sits among the pinnacle of the global elite. And ever since William the Conqueror set aside one third of England as personal hunting preserves, conservation has been deeply implicated in the defence of privilege. While the British monarchy and others have been central to the spread of conservation, it is based on elite privilege, exclusion, dispossession and separation of humans from their environment. Our point here is not that the elite’s interactions with nature are somehow unsavoury, even though it may involve a certain amount of hunting. But while the British public were upset that Prince Philip shot a tiger shortly after founding the WWF, and while the Spanish public were furious that their king went hunting elephants as they struggled with economic woes, there was very little adverse impact to wildlife (besides the trophy victims). The point is rather that royalty more often draws attention, bringing a certain amount of glamour and excitement to particular experiences of nature. In the 1920s, the East African safaris of the future kings Edward VIII and George VI helped mould the expectations of what such trips should be like. Royal support causes Britons to notice and listen, and many will do so less critically than they might otherwise. Fortunately, our royal family is, at its core, public-spirited. By this we mean that one of its goals is undoubtedly a society which is more alive to conservation issues. And this ultimately will entail moving away from elitist, white, wealthy people that engage in external interventions in countries and communities far distant from their headquarters. It means a move to more local and grassroots conservation organisations instead, and a recognition that this a fight to shape and determine the terms of the debate, a war of position as the Italian intellectual Gramsci would put it, as much as a battle. Following the launch of Prince William’s new conservation charity United for Wildlife, BBC Nature examines which animals already receive a degree of royal protection"

"Agreeing on their fifth assessment report two weeks ago, the 195 member governments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change accepted that to meet their goal of limiting global warming to 2°C, the planetary carbon budget - total carbon emissions released from the dawn of the industrial age - must be limited to one trillion tonnes. But today’s latest report from the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute suggests the governments did not comprehend what this really entails. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects are struggling, with five cancelled and seven put on hold in the past year alone. As the IPCC gathered in Stockholm, neighbouring Norway announced the cancellation of their flagship Mongstad CCS project, which would have stripped CO2 from a petrochemical and power plant and injected it into geological formations below the North Sea. We have already burned through more than half of those trillion tonnes of carbon, with at least double the remainder lying in economically viable reserves of fossil fuels, and an energy industry that keeps finding more. Don’t blame the industry. The value of our pensions is based on the assumption that these reserves will be sold and burnt. So limiting carbon emissions to a trillion tonnes means either we accept global warming beyond 2°C, or we develop CCS to use fossil fuels without releasing CO2, or the value of our pensions takes a hit. CCS is often seen as “one of a suite of options” in combating climate change. But once we accept that the world’s fossil energy stores will be used someday (and what right have we to tell the citizens of India in 2080 no to burn their coal?) then the only question that really matters is what fraction of remaining reserves will be captured and stored. If we are to meet the 2°C goal, that fraction needs to be at 50% by mid-century and heading for 100% by 2100. We might even need to “go negative” - pulling CO2 out of the air in order to stabilise the climate. That’s not something that can be done with low-energy lightbulbs. The maths are simple: to limit remaining carbon emissions to 450 billion tonnes, the fraction of extracted carbon we sequester must increase by 1/450th, or 0.22%, for every billion tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere. That’s not a policy, that’s a fact. Many environmentalists find this fact uncomfortable, and complain that CCS is “unproven technology” - this isn’t true, the industry has been doing it for decades - or worry the reservoirs may leak. With the right geology, nature herself has demonstrated that CCS works: ancient CO2 is often found in oil and gas fields. But finding the right formations, and learning to avoid less reliable ones, is indeed one of the biggest challenges facing the CCS industry. All the more reason to roll out CCS progressively - and why a global carbon tax or cap-and-trade regime won’t work. The price of CCS is relatively inelastic, so we cannot afford to wait until the carbon price is high enough for CCS to be viable and then expect to deploy it overnight. The only aspect of CCS that can truly be called “unproven” is this price. When the Mongstad CSS project was launched, the then Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg called the plant “Norway’s moon landing.” The analogy proved all too apt: as a tax-payer-funded demonstration project, costs predictably spiraled out of control. Compare the Gorgon gas project in Australia, where a US$2 billion CO2 reinjection facility is coming on stream, despite the change of government, with less then 3% of the cost paid by the taxpayer. How? Because the Western Australian state government made it a condition for granting a licence to extract natural gas that the CO2 be buried back underground. The gas was so valuable that, as one industry insider put it to me, “We thought about it for five minutes and said yes”. This is how to solve climate change without squandering taxpayers’ money or restricting economic development. Anyone wishing to extract or import fossil fuel should be required to demonstrate that an increasing fraction of the carbon content of that fuel has been verifiably sequestered.   This is not asking the impossible of either politicians or industry. Imposing a regulation on a few major companies is far simpler than negotiating a global carbon tax or emissions trading regime. Provided the sequestered fraction is increased gradually, and the cost borne at the point of extraction, the effect on energy prices would be manageable. To be fair and effective, the rules should apply to all fossil fuels - the effects of carbon on the climate is the same whether from coal, oil or gas. Needless to say, many in industry prefer the idea of a modest carbon tax, but that will achieve nothing except making climate policy unpopular. Climate change sceptics claim CCS is unnecessary, but even they accept we are unlikely to be able to dump one-and-a-half trillion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere without negative consequences. And given how profitable this practice is today, why should we expect tomorrow’s taxpayers to clean up the mess? Environmentalists hate the idea most of all: it won’t work, will cost too much, would be cheaper to put up more windmills. But all that renewables, nuclear and energy efficiency can do is slow the rate at which we carbonise the atmosphere. The bottom line on the IPCC’s carbon budget is if we still blow the budget in the end, it doesn’t matter if we blow it slower. Once we recognise this inescapable fact, there really is no alternative. The fossil fuel industry is getting on for 10% of the world economy. If ensuring CCS is made reliable and affordable was the price of staying in this remarkably profitable business, I’m happy to bet my pension they would make it happen. I wonder whether the environmentalists’ real fear is not that the industry will fail, but that it might succeed."
"The Editor,
Someone should tell your gloating Prime Minister that just because some part of Oz is experiencing record high temperatures it does NOT mean that the ‘planet’ (as we now call it because it sounds profound) is warming.  For example, NZ has had two of the coldest months on record.  Places all around the world are often colder or warmer than ‘normal’.  But the averages have not changed since the days of Ned Kelly’s grandfather – and before.  It would be remarkable, indeed, if that were not the case.
Obviously  Mr Rudd paid more attention to Mandarin than meteorology.
Keep trucking!

From DOE/OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY and the “calculate the uncertainty of chaos” department
ORNL-led study analyzes electric grid vulnerabilities in extreme weather areas
A new ORNL-developed method pinpoints electrical service areas across the southern United States most vulnerable to climate change and predicted population growth, which could inform decision makers about future substation needs. CREDIT ORNL
OAK RIDGE, Tenn., July 29, 2016 – Climate and energy scientists at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a new method to pinpoint which electrical service areas will be most vulnerable as populations grow and temperatures rise.
“For the first time, we were able to apply data at a high enough resolution to be relevant,” said ORNL’s Melissa Allen, co-author of “Impacts of Climate Change on Sub-regional Electricity Demand and Distribution in the Southern United States,” published in Nature Energy.
Allen and her team developed new algorithms that combine ORNL’s unique infrastructure and population datasets with high-resolution climate simulations run on the lab’s Titan supercomputer. The integrated approach identifies substations at the neighborhood level and determines their ability to handle additional demand based on predicted changes in climate and population.
The new, high-resolution capability can explore the interconnections in complex systems such as critical infrastructure and weather and determine potential pathways to adapt to future global change.
“These results can affect how future service areas are defined and where new substation capacity within the national grid may need to be located,” Allen said.
The authors note the study could inform city leaders and utilities when planning for adjustments or upgrades to existing infrastructure. The analysis also helps decision makers prepare resources needed for population movement in response to future extreme weather events, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. After a natural disaster, such as a high intensity hurricane, tens of thousands could be displaced to areas ill-equipped to handle the sudden influx of people for an unknown period of time.
For this analysis, the research team examined impacts of population and temperature changes through 2050 in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, but Allen said that the method could be applied to other regions.
###
Co-authors of the study were ORNL’s Mohammed Olama and Joshua Fu and Steven Fernandez from the University of Tennessee. Fu has a joint appointment at ORNL. This research was supported by DOE’s Office of Science. Additional power data for this project was provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
The Titan supercomputer is part of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility.

Impacts of climate change on sub-regional electricity demand and distribution in the southern United States
Abstract:
High average temperatures lead to high regional electricity demand for cooling buildings, and large populations generally require more aggregate electricity than smaller ones do. Thus, future global climate and population changes will present regional infrastructure challenges regarding changing electricity demand. However, without spatially explicit representation of this demand or the ways in which it might change at the neighbourhood scale, it is difficult to determine which electricity service areas are most vulnerable and will be most affected by these changes. Here we show that detailed projections of changing local electricity demand patterns are viable and important for adaptation planning at the urban level in a changing climate. Employing high-resolution and spatially explicit tools, we find that electricity demand increases caused by temperature rise have the greatest impact over the next 40 years in areas serving small populations, and that large population influx stresses any affected service area, especially during peak demand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThough Vince Ebert makes his living as a prominent cabaret artist in Germany, he is in fact a trained physicist who has a good understanding of science and is thus quite able to see it when someone is trying to pull the wool over our eyes.

Prominent cabaret artist, physicist Vince Ebert says electric cars nowhere near what they are portrayed to be. Image cropped from Facebook here. 
One example is Germany’s “Energiewende” (transition to renewable energies) where Germany is attempting to wean itself off fossil fuels and to supply its energy needs almost completely with green energies such as wind and sun.
One aim Germany has is to convert all its motor vehicles on the street over the electric vehicles. In fact some green politicians have even called for banning the registration of fossil fuel cars by 2030.
So just how feasible (or absurd) is the proposal? Ebert points out in an opinion piece here, that is a lot easier said than done. Clearly the whole idea is in fact quite absurd.
First he notes that electric cars are a long way from having the over 700+ kilometer range of fossil fuel cars and that electric cars reaching that range are “dreams of the future“.
Quarter million wind turbines
Another major obstacle is the lack of charging stations. Even if Germany managed to put merely 1 million electric cars on its streets, Ebert calculates that this would necessitate the construction of 35,000 wind turbines.

However in Germany there are in fact some 6o million vehicles on the road, and “if every driver charged his car for 30 minutes every second day” and did so evenly distributed over a smart grid, “we would need 140 new power plants or 220,000 wind turbines“…which is almost 10 times more than what is already installed.
This is an enormous number — and it would only be enough for the electric cars and not even include the tens of millions of households, businesses and industry that together need even more power than Germany’s transportation sector.
Worse than fossil fuels
Another problem, Ebert points out, is the enormous size of the batteries. In order to replace the 30 liters of petrol of a conventional car, an electric vehicle needs a modern lithium battery weighing some 900 kilograms. Supplying the hundreds of millions of cars in operation worldwide with the lithium and neodymium would be nowhere near sustainable, Ebert writes. He also cites findings by Germany’s renowned Fraunhofer Institute: 
Moreover the Fraunhofer-Institute for Structural Physics concluded that the manufacture and recycling of modern batteries has a negative impact on the ecological budget when compared to the fossil fuel engines.”
In a nutshell, electric cars would only make the environment much worse.
Then there are the organizational aspects of using electric car batteries, Ebert reminds us, asking readers to imagine millions of Germans all leaving at once for summer holidays on the autobahns and then all of them trying to charge their vehicles all at once along the motorway after a just couple of hours of driving. Huge traffic jams would form as cars charge up at stations at the rest areas. While a fossil fuel car can fill up in a matter of minutes, electric cars would be blocking the charging stations for an hour or more. It would be total chaos and mayhem.
Ebert summarizes his opinion on the rush to electric cars by quoting biologist Thomas Huxley:
The great tragedy of science – the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.”

Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in _American Electric Power v. Connecticut_ , the massive greenhouse‐​gas suit. Like the other “big” global warming/​climate change suits, this one suffers from a basic and incurable defect: it seeks to undermine the separation of powers established under the U.S. Constitution by inviting the courts to address “political questions” of a sort properly resolved by other branches of government. As Cato’s amicus brief by Ilya Shapiro and Evan Turgeon explained in the case of _Comer v. Murphy Oil_ :   




“[W]hile it executes firmly all the judicial powers intrusted to it, the court will carefully abstain from exercising any power that is not strictly judicial in its character, and which is not clearly confided to it by the Constitution.” _Muskrat v. United States_ , 219 U.S. 346, 355 (1911). A dispute is not “judicial in its character” when, among other reasons, the plaintiff does not have “standing” or the claim raises a “political question.” … And the political question doctrine, for which “the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations,” _Coleman v. Miller_ , 307 U.S. 433, 454–55 (1939), isolates the judiciary from policy disputes the Constitution assigns to the democratic process. 



By its nature, global warming is exactly the sort of policy question traditionally entrusted to the political branches: it is wholly unsuited to individualized justice based on links between particularized emissions and particularized effects, its proposed remedies are much disputed and likely to be the result of inevitably arbitrary compromise, sovereign negotiations with foreign actors play a crucial role, and so forth. As the courts have long recognized, one does not generate a case for judicial action simply by piling atop each other the propositions “something needs to be done” and “the political branches have not done it.” Indeed, the Obama administration itself has more or less invited the Supreme Court to dismiss the action on political‐​question grounds.   
  
  
The Cato Institute filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to review the American Electric Power case and then filed another amicus brief on the merits. Anyone interested in how the complexities of the Court’s “political question” doctrine apply in this case should read — in addition to Ilya Shapiro’s blog posts here and here — this new article in the Federalist Society’s publication Engage by Megan L. Brown of Wiley Rein LLP, who has served as Counsel of Record to the Cato Institute in its amicus briefs in this area. Brown provides a thorough explanation of why all three of the major warming suits fail the justiciability test, why Justices Kennedy and Breyer may be worth watching as “swing” votes in _AEP_ , and how the new case affords the court a chance to revisit its problematic pro‐​regulatory holding in _Massachusetts v. EPA_ (2007). (More from Brown in this _Christian Science Monitor_ op‐​ed.)   
  
  
Also worth reading on this subject: Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, by no means known as a general skeptic of environmental regulation, who has assisted the defense side in this litigation and explains some of the reasons in a new _Boston Globe_ op‐​ed.

Soon after the election, Clinton administration officials will journey to Buenos Aires to buy American votes for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. This is the agreement negotiated last 1 December that would effectively require us to reduce our energy use an astounding 30 to 40 percent below where we would use by the year 2010 if we just continued on our merry, prosperous way. 



Sixteen months ago, the Senate voted 95–0 for a resolution declaring that it would not even consider a climate treaty that would cause economic damage or failed to include the world’s developing nations. The Kyoto Protocol requires only the United States, Canada, the European Community and a few others to actually reduce their emissions. China, India, Mexico and just about every up‐​and‐​coming economic competitor don’t have to do a thing except burn fossil fuel in manufacturing operations, while we export jobs to them. At least Kyoto kills the Asian contagion. 



But unless the administration can somehow demonstrate that what it calls “key developing nations” are playing ball, the Senate simply will reject the treaty if it’s ever formally offered. Hence November’s junket to Buenos Aires, for a gathering officially called the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. 



Clinton and Argentine president Menem have already negotiated the deal. It’s not very novel and it works like this: First, we give them money. Then, we give them technology bought by U.S. taxpayers, like gas turbine electrical generators. In turn, they plant a few trees on Patagonian hillsides that have been so overgrazed as to be useless for raising cattle. Next, Clinton claims a “joint” credit at the United Nations for reducing their emissions with our turbines and soaking up our globally distributed carbon dioxide with the trees they plant. The U.S. suppliers of the turbines and the gas that runs them ask for a subsidy because of their planetary responsibility, as they did in a letter to Clinton last month. Hardly novel.



[A]s the chief of staff of a key [Argentine] senator told me, “Look, the science doesn’t matter. I don’t care if it’s cooling or warming. You have money, and we need it, and we’ll do what you say.” 



Big old Brazil can’t take the idea that its rival across the Platte gets all this dough, so the Brazilians go along, too. They agree to stop trying to raise cattle in what used to be the tropical rainforest. That’s no sacrifice because the land there is too poor in nutrients ever to have been considered much of a pasture anyway. Beef and tropical rainforests just don’t mix. Maybe someone should have noticed, before this whole silly enterprise started, that the Yanomanis, who have lived there for centuries, aren’t cowboys and can barely feed enough children to replace their parents. 



Brazil + Argentina = a lot of South America, and South America is a pretty respectable chunk of the developing world. So what do you think of that, senator? Now that we’ve cleared away your major objection to the Kyoto Protocol, what is to keep it from being ratified? 



Forget the notion that scientific truth has anything to do with this. Everyone now knows that the computer models that served as the basis for the original climate treaty grossly overestimated global warming. And more and more people are beginning to realize that the new, improved versions are making such fundamental errors as to make us wonder what scientists really do all day. 



The problems are this bad: All of the computer models calculate that a rapid warming of the bottom 50,000 feet of the atmosphere should have been going on for the last 20 years. In fact, that zone’s temperature hasn’t changed a lick during that period. The warming that has occurred is mainly confined to the dead of winter in the coldest air masses. It hasn’t spread into the atmosphere like the computer models indicate it should have. And all of the warming in the free atmosphere over the last 40 years occurred in one gulp 22 years ago. That hiccup was so slight that no one noticed it until two decades later. 



When these facts were put before the senior staff of the Argentine Senate, they conceded that the science against global gloom and doom was pretty darned convincing. But, as the chief of staff of a key senator told me, “Look, the science doesn’t matter. I don’t care if it’s cooling or warming. You have money, and we need it, and we’ll do what you say.” 



All this from urbane Buenos Aires, capital of a not exactly poor, rapidly developing economy. Every other developing nation must be for sale at an even better price. How long before the administration buys up the support of just about everyone, so that the United States Senate no longer can argue, as the ads say, that “it isn’t global”?

"Lloyd’s of London, the world’s biggest insurance market, has said it expects up to £5bn to be paid out in claims related to the coronavirus pandemic. The insurers that operate in the Lloyd’s market are paying out Covid-19 claims in 16 different insurance areas, mostly related to event cancellations but also medical malpractice, travel cancellations and business interruption. John Neal, the chief executive of Lloyd’s of London, said the first half of the year had been exceptionally challenging. “The pandemic has inflicted catastrophic societal and economic damage calling for unparalleled measures to stifle the spread of the virus, and to get businesses and economies back on their feet,” he said. Lloyd’s said claims related to the pandemic totalled £2.4bn in the first six months of 2020, after reinsurance recoveries, leading to a £400m loss for the period. This compared with a £2.3bn profit in the first half of 2019. Insurance premiums had already started to rise before the pandemic, after a period of falling prices, and increased by 8.7% in the first half. The trend is likely to continue, said Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman of Lloyd’s. He returned to the Lloyd’s building in London three weeks ago. Hundreds of brokers and underwriters have also come back to work in the underwriting room, which reopened on 1 September after being closed since March. The 334-year-old institution has installed perspex screens between the insurance syndicates’ boxes and introduced regular “fogging” to kill viruses and bacteria. Before the pandemic, it hosted about 6,000 of its 45,000 workers on any given day. Lloyd’s has come under renewed pressure from the climate campaign group Insure Our Future to pull entirely out of coal and tar sands insurance and investments. Lloyd’s has eliminated thermal coal investments from its own investment portfolio, but has not extended this to guidance to the 90-plus syndicates that make up the market. Carnegie-Brown said Lloyd’s was working on an environmental, social, and corporate governance report, which would be published before the end of the year. He added that decisions would be made based on that report. “We may get there,” he said. “We want to look at the facts.” In October, Lloyd’s will carry out its second annual survey of harassment and bullying in the market and publish the results in November. Last year it found that nearly 500 people working in the market had either suffered or observed sexual harassment in the previous 12 months. It set up a bullying and harassment helpline after Bloomberg reported evidence from 18 women that suggested sexual harassment was rife in the market."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPolar snow and ice cover rarely cooperates, no matter what side of the warming issue you may be on. It changes so fast.
When ice cover climbs, skeptics like to claim that it shows global warming isn’t what it is often hyped up to be. And when ice cover drops to satellite era record lows, the alarmists start screaming and hollering, forgetting that low ice levels were not uncommon in the past 100 years. They freaked out just some months ago when the yearly autumn Arctic sea ice recovery faltered and fell to “record” lows. Immediately they began predicting near ice-free conditions for the coming summer.
Just as the weather does, polar ice and snow cover also acts unpredictably, and now just a few months later Northern Hemisphere snow and ice cover is back within the normal range.
Winter snow and ice cover trend for the Northern Hemisphere has in fact been trending upwards since statistics started.

And when one applies the 30-year weather mean used to define climate, the winter trend since 1987 is strongly upwards. So is the autumn trend. This 2017 winter was well above average, ranking in the top 10.
The Greenland snow and ice surface mass balance is currently also near record levels:

As meteorologist Joe Bastardi, said, it’s going to take a fair amount of warmth to make the added ice go away again. The following chart shows the changes since Sept. 1, 2016.

The big development in recent Arctic news is the “recovery” of Arctic sea ice extent, which now is back in the normal range. Quoting in part Mark Twain, reports of its death “have been greatly exaggerated”. Just months ago, alarmists were claiming an irreversible death spiral.

Depending on Arctic weather conditions later this year, anything is possible as to what the Arctic does over the coming months. One thing is sure: Its death has long been exaggerated.

"BEIJING  —   It seemed that China’s censors had finally muzzled Yang Jisheng, the famed chronicler of the Mao era. Last year, he had finished writing a widely anticipated history of the Cultural Revolution. But officials warned him against publishing it and barred him from traveling to the United States, he has said, and he stayed muted through the 50th anniversary of the start of that bloody upheaval. Now Mr. Yang has broken that silence with the publication of his history of the Cultural Revolution, “The World Turned Upside Down,” a sequel to “Tombstone,” his landmark study of the famine spawned by Mao’s policies in the late 1950s. The   book is the latest shot fired in China’s war over remembering, or forgetting, the dark side of its Communist past, a struggle that has widened under the   president, Xi Jinping. “I wrote this book to expose lies and restore the truth,” Mr. Yang writes in the book, which has been quietly published in Hong Kong, beyond the direct reach of Chinese censors. “This is an area that is extremely complicated and risky, but as soon as I entered it, I was filled with passion. ” Since Mr. Xi took power in 2012, the Communist Party authorities have denounced historians who question the party’s lionization of its past and exhume grim events like the Cultural Revolution, which Mao started in 1966, opening a decade of purges and bloodshed. Tens of millions were persecuted and perhaps a million or more people were killed in that convulsive time. But officials say dwelling on such events is subversive “historical nihilism” aimed at corroding the party’s authority. In a sign of how Chinese politics has chilled, Mr. Yang has said little publicly about the book. “Since the book was published, I’ve been told not to discuss it with foreign media,” he said in a brief telephone conversation. He would not say whether he had authorized “The World Turned Upside Down” to be published in Hong Kong. “There’s quite a lot of pressure,” Mr. Yang said. “I just wanted to restore this big story and the facts behind it, to recover the history. ” Mr. Yang, 76, was a university student in Beijing when the Cultural Revolution erupted. He threw himself into the early phase, when Mao unleashed student radicals to purge school leaders and Communist Party cadres. Mr. Yang later worked as a journalist for Xinhua, the state news agency, watching as the fervor of the Cultural Revolution fractured into disarray and disillusionment. After a career in journalism, he turned to writing histories of contemporary China. Up until several years ago, Chinese newspapers and magazines still published laudatory profiles of Mr. Yang. But now he is often denounced by Maoists emboldened by the   pronouncements. Party journals have attacked his conclusion that up to 36 million people died in a famine from 1958 caused by the Great Leap Forward, Mao’s reckless attempt to leap into a communist utopia, which Mr. Yang chronicled in “Tombstone. ” That book was published in Chinese in Hong Kong in 2008. “Yang Jisheng is not a historian,” an editorial in Global Times, an ardently   Chinese newspaper, said last year. “He leaves the impression that he’s not interested in history, and virtually all his later works display strong political tendencies. ” Last year, Yanhuang Chunqiu, a   Chinese history magazine where Mr. Yang was long a chief editor, was taken over by editors much more willing to toe the party line. The changed atmosphere was also evident when a court in Beijing ordered a historian to apologize for questioning the party’s heroic account of a 1941 battle in the war against Japan. Last year, too, Chinese media mostly stayed silent about the 50th anniversary of the start of the Cultural Revolution. An exception was an editorial in the party’s main newspaper, People’s Daily, which urged citizens to look to the future. “Chinese political culture, both past and present, insists that the legitimacy of rulers depends on an immaculate record of what they have done,” said Perry Link, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has written widely about Chinese culture and politics. “They’re afraid that telling the truth about those events pulls the rug on their right to rule,” he said. “They want to be damn well sure that history stays inside its box. ” Now that “The World Turned Upside Down” has appeared in stores, the next battle will be over whether people get to read it in China, where such books are banned. The book began appearing in late December in Hong Kong, which keeps its own system of law, including much greater freedom than is found in mainland China. That freedom has shrunk in recent years. Publishers there have been spooked by the 2015 abduction to China of five Hong Kong booksellers who peddled lurid, poorly sourced potboilers about China’s leaders. Even so, Hong Kong remains an enclave for books banned in mainland China. Piles of Mr. Yang’s book in bookstores there suggest that mainland readers have been buying copies to sneak across the border, despite customs checks. “Mr. Yang’s work is quite influential inside China,” said Jian Guo, who together with Stacy Mosher translated “Tombstone” into English and is translating “The World Turned Upside Down” with Ms. Mosher. “Yes, some of his books, including ‘Tombstone,’ are banned on the mainland,” Mr. Guo said. “But an electronic version of ‘Tombstone’ has been floating around since 2008, and an enormous amount of pirated copies has been distributed by small book vendors. ” Mr. Guo, a professor at the University of   said the abridged translation of Mr. Yang’s latest book would include about   of its original content. “We expect to publish in 2019,” Eric Chinski, the editor in chief of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, said in an email. The company also published an abridged translation of “Tombstone” in 2012. Mr. Yang’s book is by no means the first history of the Cultural Revolution several were published under official auspices in mainland China in earlier decades as the Chinese government tried to confront the ordeal of the era. But in recent years, the party has become much more wary about allowing such research. Many younger people have only a sketchy idea of what happened when Mao started the Cultural Revolution to purge China of what he saw as threats to the purity and survival of his revolution. Mr. Yang “wanted his readers to remember the tragedy of the past, whether it was the Great Famine or the Cultural Revolution, to reflect on it, to make sense of it, so that the tragedy would not repeat itself,” said Mr. Guo, the translator. “He considered this task of a conscientious rememberer to be all the more urgent now in the face of the officially enforced historical amnesia in China,” Mr. Guo added. Mr. Yang did not have extensive access to archives for his new book, as he did when he wrote “Tombstone. ” Instead, he drew on hundreds of memoirs, histories and studies, many published in Hong Kong or available online, and there are fewer revelations than in his previous book. As in other recent scholarship, Mr. Yang emphasizes that much of the worst bloodshed came later in the Cultural Revolution, when Mao brought back the military and party apparatus to brutally enforce order. “It’s fair to say this is a work by an eminent journalist, rather than a product by an academic historian,” said Warren Sun, a historian of the Chinese Communist Party at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He said he had read some draft chapters of Mr. Yang’s book, and found a few debatable claims. But Mr. Yang “was working under very difficult conditions, and thus deserved great respect for his moral courage,” Mr. Sun said."

Solar image today, from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
The sun has been completely spotless on 21 days in 2016 and it is currently featuring just one lonely sunspot region.
In fact, on June 4th of this year, the sun went completely spotless for the first time since 2011 and that quiet spell lasted for about four days.  Sunspot regions then reappeared for the next few weeks on a sporadic basis, but that was followed by several more completely spotless days on the surface of the sun.
The increasingly frequent blank sun is a sign that the next solar minimum is approaching and there will be an even greater number of spotless days over the next few years.  At first, the blankness will stretch for just a few days at a time, then it’ll continue for weeks at a time, and finally it should last for months at a time when the sunspot cycle reaches its nadir.  The next solar minimum phase is expected to take place around 2019 or 2020. The current solar cycle is the 24th since 1755 when extensive recording of solar sunspot activity began and is the weakest in more than a century with the fewest sunspots since cycle 14 peaked in February 1906.
One other note, the weak solar cycle and the expectation for continued low solar activity this upcoming winter is an important factor in this year’s colder-than-normal Winter Outlook for the Mid-Atlantic region.

"Boris Johnson has defended proposals to appoint Tony Abbott as a UK trade envoy despite claims that his misogynistic and homophobic comments, as well as his denial of the climate crisis, make him unfit to represent the UK on the world stage. The prime minister addressed the issue on Friday after days of mounting pressure to drop the planned appointment. He dismissed the concerns of a wide range of campaigners who have insisted there are better candidates than the former Australian prime minister for the Board of Trade role. “I don’t, obviously, don’t agree with those sentiments at all. But then I don’t agree with everyone who serves the government in an unpaid capacity on hundreds of boards across the country – and I can’t be expected to do so,” said the prime minister during a visit to Solihull. “What I would say about Tony Abbott is this is a guy who was elected by the people of the great liberal democratic nation of Australia. It’s an amazing country, it’s a freedom-loving country, it’s a liberal country. There you go, I think that speaks for itself.” Campaigners have suggested Abbott’s appointment would send out a damaging message to the world about the UK’s position on various issues. They have also claimed his views meant that in any trade deals he struck, Abbot would be unlikely to secure safeguards to protect the people he has disparaged. An open letter, signed by the actor Sir Ian McKellen, the Doctor Who screenwriter Russell T Davies and almost two dozen others, said on Friday that ministers should not appoint Abbott to the board. “This is a man who described abortion as ‘the easy way out’, and suggested that men may be ‘by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command’,” the letter says. “This is a man who described himself as ‘threatened by homosexuality’, and vigorously campaigned against the ultimately successful referendum in Australia to allow same-sex couples to marry. This is a man who has suggested that climate change is ‘probably doing good’, and who downplayed the link between extreme weather and bushfires at the height of this year’s Australian bushfire crisis.” While Abbott’s appointment had previously been assumed to be imminent, Downing Street insisted on Thursday that “no decisions” had been made, prompting speculation about another U-turn. Asked about the issue on Friday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, stressed Abbott did not yet have a confirmed role. “I hate to bring us back to reality but he hasn’t been appointed to anything and as far as I know there haven’t been any appointments made,” he told Sky News. “There are lots of people with whom their comments I vehemently disagree but I’m not into defending people who are not actually carrying out any role for the British government.” The hints of a change of mind come after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, raised serious concerns about Abbott’s suitability for the role, misgivings echoed by the human rights groups Amnesty International and Liberty, the Trades Union Congress, the Fawcett Society for women’s equality, and the environmental group Greenpeace. The Board of Trade is a historical body revived by Theresa May’s government to advise on Britain’s post-Brexit trade policy around the world. It is understood Abbott’s name was on a list of potential candidates approved by No 10 several weeks ago, but a final announcement has since been delayed. The post is unpaid. The shadow women and equalities minister, Marsha de Cordova, has written to her government counterpart, Liz Truss, who is also the international trade secretary, to express her alarm at Abbott’s “offensive and outdated views”. De Cordova said she was “disappointed” at Truss’s own refusal in parliament on Thursday to answer questions about Abbott’s views, action for which Truss was reprimanded by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. Separately, the Guardian has learned that Emily Thornberry, the shadow international trade secretary, also wrote to Truss. In a letter copied to the cabinet secretary, Thornberry asked 25 questions, including whether the post was advertised in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, and whether the job was discussed when Truss appeared alongside Abbott at recent public events."

The _Financial Times_ has a bunch of COVID-19 graphs in an [article](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest). Here is one.



Note the blue, ‘Washington state’, now recording 50 daily deaths.



What does the Washington state government [site say](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus)?



Well, that is curious. Washington state has never had a daily death count above 20. Is the data FT is relying on coming from a dodgy source? 



How are the model predictions going? When will Washington state expect the peak number of deaths? Maybe 50 is just around the corner? Here is the answer from an [article](https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/coronavirus-peak-apex-statebystate/2020/04/07/id/961754/) titled ‘ _Pandemic’s Peak – Here’s The Date for Your State_ ‘.



Well, that’s encouraging; the peak has passed. The worst day, according to the models was 27 March.



Oops! In true climate science reporting-speak, “The lowest since records began.”

"**China has passed a wide-ranging new security law for Hong Kong which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the city's autonomy.**
Critics have called it ""the end of Hong Kong"" - so what do we know, and what do people fear the most?
Hong Kong was always meant to have a security law, but could never pass one because it was so unpopular. So this is about China stepping in to ensure the city has a legal framework to deal with what it sees as serious challenges to its authority.
The details of the law's 66 articles were kept secret until after it was passed. It criminalises any act of:
The law came into effect at 23:00 local time on 30 June, an hour before the 23rd anniversary of the city's handover to China from British rule.
It gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech - China has said it will return stability.
The new law's key provisions include that:
Only a handful of people had seen the full text of the law before it was enacted, a source of considerable controversy in Hong Kong. They did not include the territory's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam.
She told the UN Human Rights Council hours before it came into force that it would fill a ""gaping hole"" and not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy or its independent judiciary. She also promised it would not be retroactive.
Beijing has said Hong Kong should respect and protect rights and liberties while safeguarding national security - but many still fear the loss of Hong Kong's freedoms with this law.
""It is clear that the law will have a severe impact on freedom of expression, if not personal security, on the people of Hong Kong,"" Professor Johannes Chan, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC before the passage of the law.
There are reports of people deleting Facebook posts, and concerns that candidates opposing the national security law will be disqualified from running in elections.
Many are also afraid Hong Kong's judicial independence will be eroded and its judicial system will look increasingly similar to mainland China's. The city is the only common law jurisdiction in China.
""Effectively, they are imposing the People's Republic of China's criminal system onto the Hong Kong common law system, leaving them with complete discretion to decide who should fall into which system,"" says Professor Chan.
Some pro-democracy activists - such as Joshua Wong - have been lobbying foreign governments to help their cause. Such campaigning could become a crime in the future. He has now quit his Demosisto party.
People also worry that a threat to Hong Kong's liberties could affect its attractiveness as a leading global business hub and economic powerhouse.
Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle.
They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has.
Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact is own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law - but it never happened because of its unpopularity.
Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.
China doesn't want to see that happen again.
Many might ask how China can do this if the city was supposed to have freedoms guaranteed under the handover agreement.
The Basic Law says Chinese laws can't be applied in Hong Kong unless they are listed in a section called Annex III - there are already a few listed there, mostly uncontroversial and around foreign policy.
These laws can be introduced by decree - which means they bypass the city's parliament.
If you want to find out more about China-Hong Kong tensions read more here:
Critics say the introduction of the law this way amounts to a breach of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which is so important to Hong Kong - but clearly it is technically possible to do this.

"“The farming sector will still pay more for inputs such as fertilizer,electricity,fuel and transport and because they have always been price takers you can guarantee ETS charges levied on food processors will end up being paid by the farmer.
“Exempting agriculture is like being thrown from a 10th floor window instead of a 20th floor window – the result is the same.”

New Zealand’s border restrictions will come with significant job and business losses in the tourism sector, both at home and in the Pacific. But the new travel rules are absolutely necessary to protect the health of New Zealanders and people right across Pacific Islands, because New Zealand is a gateway country for many travellers entering the region. 



Health systems in Pacific Island countries are [under-resourced](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/activities/strengthening-pacific-health-systems) and people often live communally, putting them at greater risk of transmission. New Zealanders have good reason to be particularly aware of this because of the [Samoan measles outbreak](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/406802/two-more-deaths-from-measles-in-samoa-over-new-year-period) in late 2019, which claimed 83 lives. It is likely that the disease came into Samoa from someone travelling from Auckland.



Speaking at the University of the South Pacific in Suva last month, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern [promised New Zealand would assist](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/410430/new-zealand-to-give-2m-to-fiji-climate-change-relocation-fund) with issues such as climate change and infectious diseases because they are “borderless challenges and they demand a collective response”.



Drawing from the experience of the measles outbreak, Samoa announced in January that visitors would only be allowed into the country if they had [medical clearance](https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/408478/coronavirus-samoa-s-preventative-measures-hitting-travellers) within three days before travelling. 



This weekend, Samoa’s rules [became even stricter](http://www.samoagovt.ws/2020/03/updated-travel-advisory-novel-coronavirus-covid-2019/). Travellers from 33 countries where COVID-19 has been spreading – including Australia – now have to self-quarantine for 14 days before arrival and show evidence of a clear COVID-19 test no older than five days.



Tourism is New Zealand’s [biggest export earner](https://www.tourismnewzealand.com/about/about-the-tourism-industry/), contributing 21% of foreign exchange earnings and 5.8% of GDP. The industry has thrived in recent years and employs [229,566 people](https://tia.org.nz/about-the-industry/quick-facts-and-figures/). 



Within a day of the [new border rules](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/major-steps-taken-protect-new-zealanders-covid-19), Air New Zealand announced cuts to services to the US, Canada, Argentina, Japan and the UK and confirmed it is looking to reduce staff by up to 30%, with 3750 people affected. 



Ardern’s border control announcement is [devastating news](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/411788/queenstown-bracing-for-devastating-loss-of-visitors) for many tourism businesses. Some are already struggling because [Chinese tourists were barred](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-zealand-restrict-travel-china-protect-against-coronavirus) from entering New Zealand at the start of February. Now most tourists will be cancelling or postponing travel plans, and some [tourism businesses may go under](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/411753/travellers-self-isolation-warning-tens-of-thousands-of-tourism-jobs-in-jeopardy).



Tourism Industry Aotearoa chief executive Chris Roberts has called on the government to support the mental health needs of both tourism employers and employees during this “[incredibly stressful time](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/tourism-boss-pleads-mental-health-support-industry-buckles-under-coronavirus-outbreak)”. 



Tourism is also vital to small economies in the Pacific – it delivers between [10% and 70% of GDP in eight South Pacific Island states](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337854342_Development_and_change_Reflections_on_tourism_in_the_South_Pacific). 



New Zealanders and Australians are the major international markets for tourism in Fiji, the Cook Islands and Samoa, and currently both governments have warned against any non-essential international travel. In addition, many Pacific countries [closed their doors to China](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/anticipating-covid-19-pacific) some weeks ago, and the impacts from that are already evident.



In particular, Samoa is suffering. It has been dealt a double blow with the measles outbreak a few months ago and now this pandemic. The chief executive of the Samoa Tourism Authority, Fa’amatuainu Lenata’i Suifua, predicts earnings from tourism this calendar year will be half of their usual level. 



He told me he fears for the 5,000 people employed in the sector, and for some businesses which are struggling to service their loans. But he believes the travel restrictions are necessary. 



The common talk here is that we can always get money back, but once there’s a loss of life you’ll never have that back again, especially in a culture that values its elders.



For now, New Zealanders and Australians should take the government’s advice not to travel internationally for non-essential reasons. Instead, they can support tourism businesses at home. 



Exploring our own backyards and reconnecting with nature and culture could be a great way of getting through the challenging times ahead. 



In the medium term, tourist dollars from Australia and New Zealand could help in the recovery from this health crisis. If possible, people should postpone rather than cancel travel plans for the Pacific. 



The well-established rule is that tourists should avoid places during the immediate period of a crisis or disaster but return to support the recovery phase to rebuild economies and lift the population through bringing back a sense of normalcy.



In the wake of COVID-19, people from around the world will still want to travel – and if New Zealand and Pacific countries manage to contain COVID-19 relatively well, this might add to our value globally as safe places to travel.

"
"**One year ago, black-clad youth of Hong Kong gathered outside parliament. Bricks and projectiles met rubber bullets and tear gas. Many protests and one pandemic later, the territory is facing another existential challenge. Will it survive?**
In the past 12 months, almost everyone in Hong Kong has worn a mask for one reason or another.
For the protesters who fought pitched battles against police, it was a gas mask. For the peaceful demonstrators, it was a black face covering, to make a statement. For everyone else, it was a mask to protect against the pandemic sweeping the globe.
Scarred by the memories of the 2003 Sars epidemic in the city, almost every Hong Konger donned a mask, and somehow the city came through relatively unscathed - even as the rest of the world was plunged into sickness and crisis.
Then China made an announcement.
It planned to impose a national security law - one that would make crimes of what it called ""subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference"". The law is being drafted and is likely to be approved this month.
For the many critics of the proposed law, it is tantamount to making a crime of free speech, protest and dissent - and could mean the end of the unique freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong when it was handed over to China in 1997.
""Hong Kong has entered a new stage. After what happened in the past year, Hong Kong could become totally different in the future,"" said Alice Cheung, a former student leader.
It has been a year of disbelief and mental exhaustion for Ms Cheung. She could not have imagined what her hometown would go through - and the many masks she would have to wear. Like many in the city - on all sides of the argument - her fear for the future is real and raw.
Beijing sees this as a necessary crackdown on an unruly city. Hong Kong was always meant to introduce its own national security law, but never could because the prospect was so unpopular to its people. Now, after a wave of defiance, unleashed in response to China's attempt to impose a new extradition law, Beijing is doubling down.
For Ms Cheung and others like her the proposed national security law strikes at the heart of Hong Kong's civic political identity, its success as an international hub. But most of all it strikes at people's sense of belonging.
Yet some local opponents of the law say they welcome it, even though it could spell disaster for Hong Kong economically. To describe this sentiment, Ms Cheung uses the term ""laam chau"", Cantonese slang which means ""mutual destruction"". The theory goes, if Beijing cracks down on Hong Kong, the West will have to sanction China by revoking special treatment for Hong Kong, damaging China's economy in turn.
The US laid down the gauntlet last month by threatening to remove special privileges for Hong Kong and impose sanctions on Chinese officials who undermined the city's autonomy.
Once upon a time, colonial flag-waving protesters who wanted the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs earned ridicule. Now, the UK has vowed, if Beijing goes ahead with its proposed law, to give greater rights to the three million Hong Kongers eligible for a British National (Overseas) passport, which was issued to residents born during the colonial era.
The implications of the UK's pledge are not small. Beijing has warned it will retaliate for any intervention in its internal affairs, and Hong Kong could become caught in the middle of a much bigger global dispute.
Ms Cheung was a peaceful protester, but she does not want to distance herself from the violent frontliners - partly because she has taken on the profound mistrust of the police that became a rallying cry of the protesters.
She saw people like her arrested and it changed her view of who she was and what belonging to the city meaned to her. ""I have become somewhat numb,"" she said. ""I don't have a lot of feelings when I watch the newsâ¦ I don't know if I am suppressing my feelings or what.""
Nearly 9,000 people have been arrested - 40% of them students. The youngest was just 11 years old. More than 1,800 have been charged and about one-third of them now face a charge of rioting - an offence which carries a maximum sentence of a decade in jail.
Ms Cheung worries what will come of this protest generation if China's law is passed.
When the coronavirus came it filled her with dread. She grew up at Amoy Gardens, the housing complex which was the deadly centre of the Sars outbreak in 2003. More than 300 residents were infected.
Ms Cheung was just six at that time. ""I remember how residents living at Block E had to board a bus to be quarantined at a government camp,"" she recalled. ""I remember watching on television that the number of infections jumped every day.""
Ms Cheung began wearing a face mask in early January, soon after she first heard news of a ""mysterious pneumonia"" in Wuhan.
""It reminded me of what happened during Sars,"" she said. ""There would definitely be cover-ups, and I assumed things would fare worse than what was being reported.""
Like Ms Cheung, many Hong Kongers sprang into action soon after mainland authorities confirmed human-to-human transmission. According to a study by the University of Hong Kong, nearly 75% of respondents said they used face masks when going out and about 61% said they avoided crowded places in late January. The figures jumped to 99% and 85% respectively in mid-March.
For a moment, the pandemic provided a lull from the months of protest and a unifying point for the city. Hong Kong has always taken pride in its can-do spirit. To many, surviving the pandemic was yet another example of what happens when people pull together.
The authorities had taken action, but the idea took hold among many that it had been primarily a triumph of the people.
Dr King-wa Fu, who teaches journalism at the University of Hong Kong, says that the city government reacted slowly in the early stages, cementing the perception that the community deserved credit, not the government.
""Hong Kongers have the Sars experience, and that's why people know what to do very quickly. Wear a mask, wash your hands frequently, and keep a social distance from people. We didn't really need the government to promote these messages,"" he said.
But whether or not it gets credit, experts acknowledge that the government has shown technocratic skill in managing the pandemic. Hong Kong has seen just four deaths, and no lockdown.
The announcement of China's proposed national security law relegated the successes of the virus response to a blip. The narrative of a people pulling together in a communal triumph simply evaporated.
Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam has said the proposed law must be enacted ""because national sovereignty has been undermined by ""the advocacy of independence and even violence verging on terrorist activities"".
Pro-democrats believe Beijing has been biding its time for years.
""China has always found it difficult to accept the kind of freedom and restraint to power that Hong Kong has under a separate system,"" said former lawmaker Margaret Ng.
""Now, they have chosen this way of imposing this law at the excuse of the protests last year. It gave them an opening, but they always wanted to do it.""
There are many fears about what the law could mean for Hong Kong, apart from a squeezing of civil liberties. Hong Kong's security chief, John Lee Ka-chiu, said on Wednesday police were establishing dedicated unit to enforce the new law, hinting that it would work closely with Beijing. There are fears China will set up more dedicated security organisations in the city.
Ms Ng, who is 72, said she feared speech itself could become a crime. In mid-April, she was arrested for the first time in her life, alongside 14 high-profile democracy activists.
Then there are fears for Hong Kong's cherished protest culture, which pre-dates the events of last year. It is a culture shaped in part by China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, when a million Hong Kong residents marched in support of the student protests in Beijing.
""People waited for four hours at Chater Garden before they could start marching. Back then, it was unprecedented and it was the biggest march,"" said Lam Wing-kong, who has worked for 31 years as a volunteer for the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China.
Until this year, Hong Kong authorities had always allowed the vigil and it was seen as a yardstick of the city's civil liberties - such commemorations are not allowed in mainland China. This year, it fell under a ban on public gatherings which the government said was driven by public health concerns.
Still, tens of thousands came out to commemorate those killed during the Tiananmen Square crackdown, defying the ban.
Mr Lam worries that there will be no more candlelight vigils after the national security law takes effect.
Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC she believed the city was edging towards extreme levels of protest that needed to be dealt with. ""Apart from the violence we see on the streets, you will have seen reports where bombs, petrol bombs, guns have been seized through the searches conducted by the police,"" she said.
She defended the proposed law, saying the autonomy of Hong Kong would ""not in any way affected by this decision and the legislation that is going to come"".
Many wonder if it is wise for China to go down this path, eroding Hong Kong's unique position as a part of China that enjoys the rule of law, an independent judiciary and certain freedoms.
But China has become a very different country than it was in the days before Hong Kong was handed over by the British. The advent of Xi Jinping, China's most assertive leader in decades has seen China embrace ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over Hong Kong.
The risks are not inconsiderable. Brian Fong, a Hong Kong-based comparative political scientist, described the latest development as ""a fundamental change in China's policy toward Hong Kong"" - Beijing could risk losing access to foreign capital and technology through Hong Kong.
But the economic realities have changed too. In 1997, Hong Kong's economy was equivalent to 18% of China's economy. By 2018, it had fallen to less than 3%.
And after the announcement from China, offshore accounts, exchanging US dollars, and emigration have become hot topics among Hong Kongers.
Charles Chan (not his real name), a 40-year-old lawyer who makes between HK$1 million and $2 million a year, has made changes to his personal finances. ""I will hold less Hong Kong dollars. I am also making preparations to move my money to offshore accounts,"" he said. Mr Chan is considering opening accounts in Singapore or Jersey.
No economic apocalypse has materialised so far: the Hang Seng index has recovered from an immediate sharp drop; the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to USD, remains strong; there has not been capital outflow.
But analysts predict the political storm could mean that Hong Kong will gradually lose its attractiveness as a base of regional headquarters for foreign multinationals - and the city's economy has already been battered by the protests and the virus.
""A lot of the foundations of Hong Kong's success is now at risk,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""It's not just the Hong Kong national security law, even prior to this there were concerns. It just continues this trendâ¦ Even if the law itself turns out to not directly affect Hong Kong's legal system that much, just the perception of imposing it on Hong Kong has already deepened the concerns of the business community both within Hong Kong and internationally.""
In the 1980s and early 1990s, Hong Kong experienced a wave of emigration. Tens of thousands of people left the city in fear of Communist rule. Mr Chan was among them, but he came back to build his career and start a family of his own.
""I have always planned to move once my children finish their primary education."" he said. ""If the situation in Hong Kong becomes really bad, the whole family will move.""
He did not join the protests last year but felt sympathetic to the cause, he said. ""Under China's system, there is only one voice. It clashes with Hong Kong's original system because people have different opinions and they can co-existâ¦ I don't want my children to grow up under such totalitarian values.""
There has not been a mass exodus yet, but there have been signs of growing interest in emigrating. ""The BNO has been widely publicised and there is a jump in the number of Hong Kong residents renewing those passports,"" said Mr Evans-Pritchard.
Ms Cheung is a BNO passport holder. But she has no plans to leave Hong Kong, even after this year of tumult.
""You thought you relied on your own power and made the sacrifice to meet one goal, but Beijing now tells you the bill was withdrawn because I have a tougher solution to deal with you people,"" she said.
The next significant moment in the city will be the legislative council elections in September. Everyone will be watching, after the pro-democrat successes in last year's district polls.
Ms Cheung looks forward in hope, she said, not despair, despite the political and economic uncertainty, despite the fear that Hong Kongers may decide to opt out of territory, or stay and fight to the bitter end.
""The world has entered an uncertain stage,"" she said. ""At this moment, you can only be stronger mentally to make it through."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Karl Tack is a managing director of a family-owned business that manufactures grinding tools. The company has been in operation over 7 generations and is just one of many that operate all across Germany.
According to Blick aktuell here, family-owned businesses make up 90% of the country’s number of privately owned companies. These German family-run businesses are often innovative, are export powerhouses over a broad range of niche sectors, and not surprisingly they are a major part of the German economic back bone. They are a critical pillar of Germany’s 3-trillion-euro economy.
Tack is also a board member of the industry association Die Familienunternehmer — family business owners — which represents 6000 family operated businesses in Germany with combined annual sales of 460 billion euros, reports the online Blick aktuell here. He is also the Chairman of the association’s energy policy commission.
The Association of Family Business Owners stands by the values of freedom, property, competition  and responsibility.
The success of family-run companies is not only dependent on world-class innovation, but also on a business-friendly environment. Lately, however, Germany’s energy supply has gone from being an asset to one that is now a burden for many. And as a member of the board of family-owned companies, Tack wishes “to shift his focus on energy policy“, Blick writes.
Climate and energy policy failed spectacularly
Blick quotes Tack:
The Energiewende [transition to green energies] ushered in by the German government has resulted in electricity becoming massively more expensive. The long-term consequence: Jobs are being lost, investments being moved to foreign countries and the industrial base is slowly being destroyed. Policymaking has also failed with its climate-political goals. The high-wire act of climate protection targets and efficient support programs has failed spectacularly“.
These are strong words coming from a leader of small companies, and thus a critical part of German industry, and so they need to be heeded by policymakers soon. Germany can ill-afford to see this economic locomotive weaken, let alone die off.

Because imposing tighter international financial regulations may slow global recovery from the current crisis, the new international economic order will take some time to emerge.



The overt change following a severe financial sector collapse and the recession‐​induced decline in trade volumes has been the emergence of the G-20 group of nations as the steward of the global economy.



However, the emergent order may remain quite similar to the pre‐​crisis economic order if the United States is successful in containing potential inflationary pressures from continued loose monetary policy and the dollar’s exchange value holds firm. That will eventually require a timely withdrawal of extraordinary monetary infusions being undertaken to aid economic recovery in the United States and the rest of the world.



In addition, reforms to eliminate massive fiscal imbalances in developed countries will be necessary to prevent taxes from escalating and maintain the younger generations’ incentives to continue investing in human and physical capital.



Maintaining tax rates as low as possible is clearly a prerequisite for maintaining future productivity growth and meeting emergent challenges on many fronts: population, aging, energy conservation, climate change, rising healthcare costs and so on. However, skepticism is growing about whether all of the daunting economic policy challenges can be met in a timely manner.



At the microeconomic level as well, the post‐​crisis economic order is unlikely to stop the erosion of economic security for workers in developed nations — indeed, quite the opposite. If the new regulatory framework being debated successfully preserves the process of global economic integration, workers in the developed world will continue to experience heightened job insecurity and competition from foreign workers.



They would be forced to adapt by acquiring new skills and being more mobile. Thus, policymakers in developed nations will face increasing political pressures to reduce these uncertainties via expanded social protections.



The economic crisis of 2007-09 has provoked different responses from different countries. Most have introduced economic stimulus packages to extend unemployment assistance, expanded public projects, supported investment and provided assistance to financial institutions to enable resumption of lending activities.



Although these supports should be removed as economies recover, they may not be fully reversed as the abovementioned economic pressures from globalization become more intense and unemployment rates remain high.



The new economic order appears likely to focus on subjecting private financial institutions to more stringent regulations so as to reduce their risk exposures. But that would constrain global capital flows, whereas the need is to expand them — and not just in the short‐​term to hasten recovery from the current recession.



The key for expanding capital flows, especially toward “South” countries, is reforming emerging countries’ financial systems with better corporate governance, less corruption, and growth‐​oriented macro‐​economic policies. These reforms are in the interests of both developed and developing economies, as the gains would flow to both.



Overall, forces that would interrupt globalization and those that would promote it are both present. The recent financial crisis has weakened the developed world economies, promoted “beggar‐​thy‐​neighbor” policies that benefited some nations at the expense of others and eroded support for continued globalization.



But regional interests may promote globalization in a fragmented form as countries seek to maximize the advantages of international trade and integration without any global power to enforce international laws, norms and institutions. However, such a world economic order involves considerable uncertainty and could ultimately turn out to be unstable.



Distaste for the consequences of a breakdown of the international economic order — what transpired after 1914 in terms of economic and physical destruction from two world wars — may provide sufficient momentum to allow the U.S.-led order to continue for a few more decades.



However, no nation appears capable of stepping into the U.S. role as the United States did when Great Britain was economically spent after World War II. The only candidates are Europe, China and India — but they are each either not interested or economically and militarily not capable of successfully assuming the role of global hegemon.

"Like millions of people in the western United States this week, I woke up to deep red, sunless skies, layers of ash coating the streets, gardens, and cars, and the smell of burning forests, lives, homes, and dreams. Not to be too hyperbolic, but on top of the political chaos, the economic collapse, and the worst pandemic in modern times, it seemed more than a little apocalyptic. Too much of the western United States is on fire, and many areas not suffering directly from fire are enveloped in choking, acrid smoke. While fires in the west are not unusual or unexpected, these fires are different: they’re earlier, bigger, and hotter than usual. They are expanding explosively, overwhelming towns and firefighting resources. And there’s no getting away from them. As of Thursday evening, five of the ten largest wildfires in California’s history are burning. Seven of the 10 largest fires have occurred in the last four years. This isn’t normal. What’s different now? Human-caused climate change. We’re reaping the consequences of more than a century of using the thin, delicate layer of atmosphere that surrounds the planet as a dumping ground for the major waste product of burning fossil fuels – carbon dioxide. For more than half a century, scientists have been warning of the growing threat of climate change. My own work on climate and water 35 years ago found that rising temperatures would alter California’s snowpack, water availability, and soil moisture in ways we’re now seeing in our mountains and rivers. In the early 1990s, scientists such as Margaret Torn, Jeremy Fried, Kevin Ryan, Colin Price, and others were evaluating the risks of increases in western wildfire areas and intensity under scenarios of climate change. The National Climate Assessments required by federal law have regularly warned that worsening fires were a likely future consequence of accelerating climate change. Projections have turned to reality. The future has arrived. What we’re seeing now, with massive wildfires, worsening storms, unprecedented heat, and record droughts and floods is just the beginning of the climate changes to come. On top of rising oceans, the accelerating destruction of the Arctic ice cap, expanding water crises, and new health disasters, these climate impacts are something no human society has ever experienced and for which we remain woefully unprepared. I’m not arguing any individual disaster has been caused by climate change, though the science is strengthening on that as well. I’m saying we are now seeing the unambiguous influence of climate change on these disasters. What used to be considered acts of God are now also acts of humans. Hurricanes such as Harvey in 2017 are stronger and they’re delivering more devastating floods. Heat waves are happening earlier and they’re longer and hotter than they used to be. California just experienced its hottest August on record including what may have been the hottest temperature ever recorded, in Death Valley. The wildfires, as we’ve seen, are turning into fierce, fearsome, monsters. What we’re seeing now is just the beginning of the climate changes to come The influence of climate change on wildfires is easy to see. Global warming is diminishing our mountain snowpack, leading to hotter and drier summers. Eighty percent of California, 95% of Oregon, and all of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico are currently in drought. Severe droughts over the past decade have killed hundreds of millions of trees in our forests, adding to the fuels available to burn. Higher temperatures further dry out forest and rangeland soils. Unusual lightning storms are igniting multiple fires at a time, overwhelming our ability to squelch them early. We’re not alone. The wildfire signal of climate change is being seen around the world, in southern Europe, Canada, Australia, South America, and Africa, and other climate-change impacts are accelerating too, in the form of storms, melting glaciers, rising seas, and more. More and more scientists are speaking out about the connections between these disasters and climate change. The media is slowly getting better at reporting these links, though too many stories still fail to do so. It is also time for our politicians to lead or get out of the way. For decades both major political parties in the US ignored the climate problem, putting off decisions for the next generation and permitting the rich and powerful fossil fuel interests to hide, misrepresent, and deny the science and the threat. And the claim that the cost of tackling climate change is too high is complete crap. The reality is the cost of failing to address the problem is so much higher. We have no more time to twiddle our collective thumbs. The bad news is that the long delay in tackling climate change means that some severe impacts, like the fires we’re seeing now, are no longer avoidable and we must begin the process of adapting to them. We must, at the same time, accelerate the complete elimination of fossil-fuel combustion to slow the rate of future climate changes and prevent even worse, potentially catastrophic impacts from occurring. The good news is that we know how to do both things. Adaptation options include changing zoning laws, forest management, construction practices and building materials, insurance policies, and public health strategies. And the amazingly fast growth in renewable energy options and the dramatic plunge in their costs means that it makes economic as well as well as environmental sense to get rid of fossil fuels. The links between human-caused climate change and extreme events are real, dangerous, and worsening. But now that we’re beginning to accept and acknowledge those links, now that the public is increasingly aware of the problem, now that at least one political party has embraced the need to act, we have a chance to break these links. There is no time to waste. Peter Gleick is a hydroclimatologist, member of the US National Academy of Sciences, MacArthur Fellow, and choking, gasping Californian"
"**Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China's passing of a controversial national security law in Hong Kong is ""a grave step"".**
He said China had ignored international obligations by taking new powers which could curb civil liberties.
Hong Kong's last British governor, Lord Patten, said the move had breached agreements made with the UK before the city was handed over in 1997.
Those agreements guaranteed certain rights for 50 years.
""Despite the urging of the international community, Beijing has chosen not to step back from imposing this legislation. China has ignored its international obligations regarding Hong Kong. This is a grave step, which is deeply troubling,"" said Mr Raab.
The foreign secretary said the UK would decide what action to take when it sees the full legislation, which has not yet been published.
Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told Mr Raab in the House of Commons that he ""must not waver"" over his responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong.
Mr Raab said that ""we fully intend to see through"" plans to change visa rules to offer millions of people in Hong Kong a way to acquire UK citizenship.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the law, but added he would not be drawn into ""sinophobia"" over other issues, such as the decision to allow Huawei equipment to be used in Britain's 5G mobile data network.
Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam said the new law would fill gaps in the territory's national security legislation and would only affect a small number of people.
But with the city having seen increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement, there are fears the law criminalising secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces could mark the end of its freedoms.
Civil liberties, including the right to protest, freedom of speech and the independence of the judiciary, were enshrined in the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution that came into effect with the end of British control in 1997.
The 50-year agreement is said to implement a ""one country, two systems"" principle, because it offers Hong Kong rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China.
Lord Patten, who oversaw the handover as governor, said the security law put an end to this principle and was a flagrant breach of the agreement between Britain and China.
The UK has previously said it will change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong a way of acquiring UK citizenship if the law is passed.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would give extra rights to British National (Overseas) passport holders. Around 350,000 people in Hong Kong have this passport and a further 2.6m are eligible.
They would be allowed visa-free travel to the UK for 12 months, along with the right to work, which ""could place them on a route to citizenship,"" Mr Johnson said."

Today is a **FREE taste** of an _Insight Politics_ article by[ ](https://thebfd.co.nz/author/olivia-pierson/)**[Olivia Pierson](https://thebfd.co.nz/author/olivia-pierson/) **that was first published 13 February 2020. 



Has anyone else noticed how silent PM Ardern and Justice Minister Little have fallen over the much-touted [“fast-track review of NZ’s current hate speech laws”?](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/385955/little-plans-fast-track-review-of-hate-speech-laws)



There’s a reason for this: it’s an unpopular issue with NZ citizens and we happen to be in an election year.



NZ political commentator, **Chris Trotter** , spoke about this last week on [the Leighton Smith Podcast](https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/podcasts/the-leighton-smith-podcast/). Trotter said:



 _“One of the very few things which could derail this government is Andrew Little persisting with his determination to replicate the laws of the United Kingdom on hate speech here in NZ […] if he did that, if he’s allowed to do that […] if it were to happen, if Labour and the Greens made that the ditch to die in… David Seymour would reap a very large harvest in votes. He has put himself at the forefront of the free speech debate and I think libertarians across the country would move out of their lethargy and fight very vociferously any attempt to give us the sort of laws they have in the UK.”_



Trotter obviously has a higher view of NZ Libertarians than I do; their lethargy happens to be their most essential feature.



But Trotter makes an excellent point about Labour.



If Little goes ahead because Labour wins a second term in this upcoming election he most certainly will rely heavily on the new model of hate speech provisions that the United Kingdom have adopted. 



What exactly have the UK adopted that our Labour government seeks to implement here?



The Crown Prosecutors Services (CPS) revised its guidelines to prosecutors as to what the definition of a “hate crime” is:



 _Any criminal offence which is_ ** _perceived_** _by the victim or_ ** _any other person_** _, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice, based on a person’s disability or perceived disability; race or perceived race; or religion or perceived religion; or sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation or a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender._



This subjective perception law applies to “offences” committed online as well as face-to-face and doesn’t have to be reported by the “victim” but by any sticky-beak bystander who takes issue with it.



I have already written about the open [persecution of Renaud Camus](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/french-author-renaud-camus-convicted-for-inciting-racial-hatred/) by these laws as they apply in France (and most of Europe), who received a fine and a prison sentence for criticising immigration. 



We know that **Jacinda Ardern** and French President **Emmanuel Macron** already have many silly, but abiding crusades in common, such as prioritising ongoing trade with the failing E.U (instead of America, the most powerful economy on Earth), the _Paris Accord_ climate change hoax and the _Christchurch Call_ initiative against online “violent extremist content.” 



We also now know that violent extremist content means the politically-damned viewpoints of decent, honest intellectuals like **Renaud Camus** , rather than evil be-headers and murderers like ISIS, [whose online hate-filled, violent magazine ](https://www.oliviapierson.org/blog/jacinda-ardern-the-womans-weekly-prime-minister)_Dabiq_ is still available for free download in NZ (and probably France).



This is the Orwellian standard we all better get used to if Labour win a second term. They’re only remaining silent about it because they know in an election year, this issue will not win them votes, but be warned NZ! If Labour win, our free speech laws will be downgraded to those befitting a Banana Republic shithole.

"ASTANA, Kazakhstan  —   The first    meeting between Syrian rebel fighters and government officials in nearly six years of civil war ended abruptly on Monday when diplomatic talks quickly devolved into harsh words and competing accusations. The new round of talks arranged by Russia and Turkey in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, was meant to showcase Moscow’s increasingly dominant role in the diplomacy and its new understanding with the Turkish government, a leading sponsor of the rebels. But the Syrian delegations almost immediately began arguing and refused to negotiate directly. Mohammad   of the Army of Islam, in his opening statement, labeled the government “a bloody despotic regime” backed by “vengeful sectarian militias,” and called for it to release what he said were 13, 000 women being held as political prisoners and to end starvation sieges. That led to a heated exchange around a large circular table that forced Kazakh officials to call for calm, several participants said. The lead government negotiator, Bashar   speaking to reporters after the opening session, responded by calling the opposition delegation “armed terrorist groups,” and accused them of “impertinent” and “provocative” behavior. The tension demonstrated the challenges that remain for Russia, the Syrian government’s most powerful backer, as the Russian government tries to show its approach can accomplish more than the largely fruitless efforts led in past years by the United States and the United Nations. Expectations for progress had been low. Many diplomats and analysts say the more meaningful talks are those that have been held in recent months, largely in secret, among Russia, Turkey and Iran. The meeting in Astana, meant to send the message that Russia would seek to resolve the conflict in its sphere of influence, was markedly different from the United   talks that have taken place  in recent winters in Geneva. Delegates crisscrossed the towering atrium of the Rixos Hotel in the remote Kazakh capital built 20 years ago on the orders of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former Communist boss who has been the country’s president since it became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He has a reputation as a pragmatic strongman and enjoys good relations with Russia and Turkey. Palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside, as a    duo wearing evening gowns played “Strangers in the Night” and the theme from “Titanic. ” Western diplomats, largely sidelined, huddled in the hotel’s Irish pub, and the United States ambassador to Kazakhstan, who was invited over Iran’s objections and attended only as an observer, avoided reporters. When the Americans had participated in previous rounds of talks in Geneva, the meetings took place at the Palace of Nations, one of the stolid lakeside edifices built in the first half of the 20th century that have housed the United Nations since it was formed after World War II. Those buildings symbolized a postwar order that tried to institutionalize human rights and the laws of war, an order associated with American leadership  —   or domination  —   amid the tensions of the Cold War. Now, the role of the United States in Syria and across the Middle East is widely seen as having receded under former President Barack Obama, and its future remains uncertain. Mr. Obama, while backing some rebel groups, resisted deeper American involvement in the Syrian conflict, ceding the leading role to Russia. His successor, President Trump, has signaled broad approval of Russian leadership and policies and sent mixed messages on Syria. Officially, all sides in the Syrian conflict describe the goal of the talks in Astana as reaffirming a tenuous   in order to revive the Geneva talks. The   started in December and known formally as a cessation of hostilities, is largely ignored in many parts of the country and excludes jihadist groups, including the Levant Conquest Front and the Islamic State. A strengthening of the cessation across Syria, the United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday, could pave the way for discussion of more substantive political issues at talks scheduled for February in Geneva. The United Nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role in the talks in Astana, but Mr. de Mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator and was shuttling between the delegations who were in separate rooms. Western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in Astana could be a Russian effort to ultimately replace the Geneva discussions, which the Russian government has criticized. The Syrian government and the Russians have long argued that the Geneva framework, calling for a transitional body with full governing powers, does not require President Bashar   to step down, while the opposition has insisted that it does. But as a practical matter, an increasing number of Western countries, including the United States, and even some of the rebels’ backers in the Middle East, like Turkey, have moved toward the Russian position. With Turkey mainly concerned about checking Kurdish militants within its borders and in Syria, and the United States focused on battling Islamic State militants, they have stopped pushing loudly for Mr. Assad to step down ahead of a settlement, instead signaling that they could accept some role for him in a transitional political arrangement. There were signs on Monday of Russian willingness to apply pressure on the Syrian government to keep the talks on track. The tense exchanges in Astana were followed by a Russian statement unusually critical of the Syrian government: The   news agency RIA Novosti said monitors of a   in Syria were “particularly concerned about sporadic violations of truce by the Syrian government forces”  —   echoing a complaint of rebels. Russia’s   air campaign, which began in the fall of 2015, helped forces loyal to Mr. Assad drive rebels from their foothold late last year in half of the important city of Aleppo, an offensive criticized by the opposition for indiscriminate air and artillery attacks on civilians. Some rebel groups also shelled civilians in   areas. Now one of the main battles is over Wadi Barada, a besieged   area in the watershed that provides most of the drinking water for Damascus, the Syrian capital. Water supplies have been cut off for weeks, with the government blaming rebels and rebels blaming the government. Mr. Jaafari, the chief Syrian government negotiator and his country’s envoy to the United Nations, was incensed that Mr. Alloush, the rebel representative, had sounded the alarm over the plight of people in Wadi Barada. He said raising concerns about government attacks on Wadi Barada was tantamount to defending the Nusra Front, the former name of the Levant Conquest Front, which is excluded from the  . Residents and rebel fighters in Wadi Barada say that some Nusra fighters are present, but they are a minority among other rebel groups and civilians. Mr. Jaafari said that rebel groups had “misunderstood” the terms of the   adding, “We had guarantees from their guarantors that they would behave, but they did not behave. ” Fares Bayoush, a negotiator from an   rebel group who defected from the Syrian Army, said, “He is the one who misunderstood. ”"

"LOS ANGELES  —   Michael Govan stood in a   gallery scattered with paintings and crates at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, his arms gesturing at blank white walls, his face furled in thought. Mr. Govan is the director of the museum, but on this bright morning, he was focused on one single project: the installation of an exhibition of paintings by Agnes Martin. No detail was too small for Mr. Govan as he squinted his eyes and directed two workers, hoisting a framed canvas against a wall. “Two inches higher,” Mr. Govan said. Still not right. “A little to the left. ” Finally, Mr. Govan nodded his approval as the work was positioned into place. “Awesome. ’’ Mr. Govan could not have been more intricately involved in the details of this retrospective, as he is with pretty much everything that happens on the museum campus on Wilshire Boulevard. He knew Ms. Martin before her death in 2004 and has long adored her work. He spent months visiting collectors at their homes, explaining why they should lend their Martins to this public exhibition  —   fixating on such details as his insistence that paintings not be put under glass, which, he is quick to tell you, obscures the fine lines of her art. (“Agnes Martin would be horrified to see her work under glass,” he said. “Horrified. ”) Mr. Govan curated the exhibition, which closed after a successful run in the fall, right down to the last caption and light fixture. Mr. Govan needed the diversion. As this new year begins, he is consumed with an even more urgent and consequential campaign, one that could help define not only Los Angeles’s position on the world’s art stage but Mr. Govan’s standing in his adopted city: a $600 million reconstruction of Lacma. It is as ambitious in its architectural aspirations as in its cost. The project, a decidedly disruptive and not entirely admired design by the architect Peter Zumthor, is testing all the social, political and   skills that Mr. Govan has acquired after 10 years of maneuvering in a West Coast caldron of art collectors, wealthy patrons, celebrities and government officials. Los Angeles can be a tough place to rally civic and philanthropic support. Walt Disney Concert Hall, the glistening, now acclaimed Frank Gehry building, was almost never built. Mr. Govan was reminded of that when, days before he triumphantly unveiled $75 million in donations to his project last spring, one of this city’s most wealthy benefactors, David Geffen, announced he had given $100 million to the Museum of Modern Art  —   in New York City. (Mr. Geffen, who has not given any money to Mr. Govan’s project, declined a request to comment for this article.) Still, Mr. Govan has gathered about $300 million in commitments, with more on the way. He said he needs to raise another $150 million by the end of 2017 for the project to continue. “It’s a big project for L. A. and there’s been a little lack of confidence that the money will be raised,” Mr. Govan said last month. “But I think just getting close to the halfway point, I’ve sensed a change in my trustees and supporters. There’s this strong sense with them that this is likely to happen. ” “I will tell you just that it is going to happen,” he said. At 53, Mr. Govan is the kind of arts executive who could probably exist only in Los Angeles. He is a celebrity in a world of celebrities, with the looks of a movie star a regular at the Tower Bar on Sunset Boulevard, its tables crowded with agents and actors and someone who, naturally enough, was a guest at last year’s Academy Awards. Mr. Govan seems as comfortable describing, with the air of a senior faculty member at a fine arts college, the latest catalog of acquisitions before an audience of donors as he is posing for the    paparazzi at Lacma   attended by Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese and Kanye West. Mr. Govan breaks rules and celebrates the unconventional in a way that, if nothing else, draws attention to the museum and its director. What other museum director would orchestrate the   spectacle of moving a   boulder through the streets of Los Angeles at night before installing it on the museum grounds as “Levitated Mass,” a work by Michael Heizer? He has had exhibitions devoted to Tim Burton, Mr. Gehry and Robert Mapplethorpe. Average attendance has doubled since 2007, to 1. 6 million people. “I’m a provocateur,” Mr. Govan said. Sheila Kuehl, a member of the county Board of Supervisors, said Mr. Govan had changed the way people viewed this museum and the city. “People like to be part of something that looks to be new and the place to be,” she said. “And that’s what he has done with Lacma and L. A. He brings  —   the way Gustavo Dudamel does  —   excitement with him. ” Mr. Govan’s reputation is such that in the gossipy world of   museums and galleries, his name circulates as someone who might be summoned back to New York one day, where he served for 11 years as director of the Dia Art Foundation, perhaps to run the Museum of Modern Art, should that position ever open. Mr. Govan scrunched up his face at the suggestion as he sat on a gallery bench last month at the press preview of an exhibition devoted to the works of Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera. “Why would you leave this?” Mr. Govan said, pointing first toward the bustling exhibition and then through glass doors revealing the glorious sunshine and crisp blue skies of a typical December day in Los Angeles. “To go back to Trump Tower traffic? What exactly would be the incentive? The point of this project is to make my successor feel that this is the prestigious job. ” And there may be no better example of    than the Zumthor building. Next to the La Brea Tar Pits, it has been likened to a blob, a smoky gray, elevated   swirl of galleries resting on eight pillars that would cross over Wilshire Boulevard. Joseph Giovannini, an architecture critic, has repeatedly belittled it as Lacma’s “folly” in The Los Angeles Review of Books, a barrage of particularly stinging criticism that certainly has not made Mr. Govan’s   task any easier. “Why are we even seriously considering this misguided proposition?” Mr. Giovannini demanded in one essay, adding: “This ain’t no Rialto Bridge. It’s recycled,     pumped up to monumental scale. ” It is, as Mr. Govan is quick to acknowledge, a controversial design by Mr. Zumthor, a widely admired architect. It involves tearing down three buildings from the ’60s and one from the ’80s that critics say could be rehabilitated. Mr. Govan rejects that idea, saying they are beyond repair and exults over the ambition and imagination of the design. Other people are coming around to Mr. Zumthor’s vision as it goes through its various iterations. “I didn’t like it at first, but it grew on me,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former member of the Board of Supervisors who was instrumental in getting the county to contribute $125 million to the building. “It’s an architectural statement whether he wants it to be or not. There are some people who don’t like Zumthor or his design. It’s going to be talked about. It’s controversial. Most great buildings are controversial. ” These kinds of ambitious projects, with their attendant   campaigns and architectural debates, may be familiar in more established cities like New York or San Francisco. (The expanded San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, which opened last spring, raised $610 million in its capital campaign, easily covering the $305 million cost of its building expansion.) But for all the growing vibrancy of its arts scene, Los Angeles still suffers a bit of a reputation as a place where there is more interest in Hollywood than Hockney, whose wealthy citizens can be stingy, and where great works of art are hidden in mansions in Malibu and Bel Air. “L. A. is a place where everything is somewhat discounted and diffuse: To get the energy to come together, to make something kind of happen for the entire city and the entire community is not so easy,” said Nicolas Berggruen, a trustee of the museum who is building a new think tank, the Berggruen Institute. For Mr. Govan’s project, an environmental quality study is underway, and plans are for demolition to begin at the end of 2018. The new museum would open in 2023, coinciding with the completion of an extension of a subway line that runs under Wilshire Boulevard, which will have a stop for the museum. All that is contingent on   continuing apace. “If we stall next year, and we don’t continue to raise money, we would be in bad shape,” Mr. Govan said in December. But, he added: “Failure is not an option. The old buildings are literally coming to the end of their natural life. ” From the start, Mr. Govan has been persistent and uncompromisingly confident. “I can’t say it strongly enough: It’s not a question of whether there’s money in L. A for such a project: There is,” Mr. Govan said, sitting in his expansive   office with a view of Wilshire Boulevard, where workers were cutting down palm trees to make way for the subway line. “The question is, will people decide that’s what they want to do with it. ” “If they do this”  —   at this, Mr. Govan paused to amend his remarks  —   “when they do this, not if  —    it will be a new   mark for collective action, for achievement in the cultural space and in the philanthropic space of Los Angeles. It is not a large goal. We’re going to do it. They are going to write the checks. And they are going to be happy to do it. ” There is a sort of cautious optimism here that Mr. Govan will be able to wrangle his money, all the more so since he announced the latest $75 million, including $50 million from Elaine Wynn, an art collector who is the   of the museum, and $25 million from A. Jerrold Perenchio, a former Univision chairman who has bequeathed the bulk of his art estate to the new museum. “I think the old days of the claim that perhaps L. A. was not  —   and more specifically, Lacma was not  —   a target of sustained contribution are increasingly behind us,” said Mark   a member of the county Board of Supervisors. The optimism reflects a growing   about this city’s cultural status, but also the skills and personal force that Mr. Govan  —   with an intensity belied by an easygoing smile  —   has brought with him from New York. “It’s going to take a couple of very significant donors to get this over the hump,” said David C. Bohnett, a wealthy philanthropist and board trustee. He added, “It would be much harder if there wasn’t the enthusiasm and the unanimous support of the board. ” A conversation with Mr. Govan can be an exhausting torrent of ideas and provocations, from his proclamation that the city’s homeless crisis could be solved, given the wealth and intellectual capital here, to what seemed an almost offhand idea of building a Frank Gehry skyscraper across from the museum, which would tower over a charming,   neighborhood of mission revival homes. “There’s not a city in America that will look as different in 30 years as L. A. will look,” Mr. Govan said. “They are tearing down whole city blocks as we are speaking. I love it. ” “It’s changing,” he said. “Don’t you see it before your eyes? Out your window? Since it’s going to change, what’s it going to change into? I’m not sure I know. I am certainly drawn to the fact that each of us is going to have a little impact on it. ” Members of his Board of Trustees say meetings with Mr. Govan veer into tutorials on the history of art. “Whenever we are together, it’s like after we finish doing our Lacma business, he gets this drug dealer look in his eyes and is like, ‘You want to go so see some art? ’” Ms. Wynn said. “I think what’s driving him is this sense of history and timing. Michael accurately perceives that the pulse of newness and creativity is happening in L. A. now. ” Mr. Govan is clearly an admirer of Los Angeles, even as he acknowledges its challenges. “When I moved here, people in New York said to me, ‘L. A. is   and everybody does their own thing it’s not a good place to do a public big museum,’” he said. “There was this rap on L. A.  —   and I think some of this is true  —   that it is a wonderful place to be a creative individual. You have tremendous freedom to work on your own, you can be anonymous, and you can be eccentric. But what L. A. has not done well is the collective of people working together for public goals. The museum world is just a reflection of that. It’s mostly been people doing things on their own. ” Mr. Govan’s campaign comes as the Los Angeles art world is churning. The Broad Museum, exhibiting Eli and Edythe Broad’s collection of modern art, opened downtown in 2015, and on the other side of the cultural tracks, Hauser  Wirth took over a sprawling old flour mill in the Arts District, turning it into a   gallery that is already crowded on weekends. This city is awaiting the April opening of a private art museum from Maurice and Paul Marciano, Guess   in a renovated Masonic Temple in Koreatown. The Santa Monica Museum of Art is moving to the downtown Arts District this fall, with a new name: the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. And George Lucas, the filmmaker, after years of “site wars,” recently announced he would bring his Museum of Narrative Art to Exposition Park and fund the project  —   about $1 billion  —   himself. “There’s no question that the art scene in Los Angeles has become dramatically elevated on the global stage,” said Casey Wasserman, an entertainment executive and museum trustee. “It’s our time. ” Mr. Govan said that Los Angeles stood out today as a city where art is being made  —   as artists flock here to take advantage of the light and the space  —   rather than a place where it is being shared with the public. “You could argue that there is no city that is more vibrant,” he said. “You may argue there are cities as vibrant  —   Berlin is very vibrant New York City outside of Manhattan is very vibrant. ” But he said that alone does not make Los Angeles the cultural capital it aspires to be. “I say this to my board: ‘You can’t just be boastful and say L. A. is going to be one of the greatest cultural cities on earth. That’s not a forgone conclusion. Even with all the artists. You can’t sit back and watch. That’s why the museum is important. ’” There are few people who would quarrel with his record so far. “His vision has been to turn the Lacma campus into a center for L. A. and it’s working,” Mr. Yaroslavsky said. “It has indeed become L. A.’s living room, a magnet. And when the Zumthor museum opens, it will exponentially increase the power of that magnet. ” Mr. Bohnett said that Mr. Govan has “deep and established East Coast roots” but that no matter the temptation of working in a place like New York, he could not see him leaving. “Where is the place he can make his biggest mark?” Mr. Bohnett said. “It’s Los Angeles. ”"

Climate change prosecutors suffer defeat as attorney general pulls Exxon subpoena
Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude E. Walker agreed Wednesday to withdraw his climate-related subpoena of ExxonMobil, a stunning reversal that delivered a blow to the Democratic-led effort to prosecute climate change dissent.
Claude E. Walker, Attorney General, Virgin Islands
In the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal, Mr. Walker said he would pull his March 15 subpoena of the world’s largest energy company, which had challenged the subpoena as unconstitutional.
“After conferring on this matter, the parties mutually agreed that Attorney General Walker will withdraw the subpoena and ExxonMobil will stipulate to the dismissal without prejudice of this action,” said the four-page document filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
The decision indicates a dramatic scaling back of Mr. Walker’s climate change investigation, coming just five weeks after he withdrew his subpoena of the free market Competitive Enterprise Institute.
The retreat also comes as an ominous sign for AGs United for Clean Power, a coalition of 17 attorneys general, including Mr. Walker, formed in March to pursue the fossil fuel industry and others that challenge the catastrophic climate change narrative for “fraud.”
Mr. Walker’s subpoena had demanded that Exxon produce a decade’s worth of communications with more than 100 academics, think tanks and universities, including Arizona State University, George Mason University, Lindenwood University, the Weidenbaum Center at Washington University in St. Louis and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
Democrats and environmentalists have cheered the probe of whether fossil fuel companies and skeptics have misled the public on climate change, while Republicans and First Amendment advocates have denounced the effort as an attempt to chill free speech and scientific inquiry.
Mr. Walker’s aggressive decision to issue the Exxon and CEI subpoenas put him at the forefront of the effort, but his impassioned climate change advocacy also raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation.
“It could be David and Goliath, the Virgin Islands against a huge corporation, but we will not stop until we get to the bottom of this and make it clear to our residents, as well as the American people, that we have to do something transformational,” Mr. Walker said at the March 29 press conference. “We cannot continue to rely on fossil fuel.”
Of the roughly 100 academic institutions and free market groups listed on the Virgin Islands’ Exxon subpoena, 69 were listed on Greenpeace’s #ExxonSecrets website, and in almost the same order.
Pacific Legal Foundation litigation director James S. Burling called the overlap between the Virgin Islands subpoena and the Greenpeace list a “remarkable coincidence.”
Critics have also accused Mr. Walker of attempting to squeeze Exxon in order to score a windfall along the lines of the multibillion-dollar 2006 tobacco settlement. His office had paired with prominent plaintiffs’ lawyer Linda Singer of Cohen Milstein, the former D.C. attorney general.
…
New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, who leads the coalition, has denied that the coordinated prosecutorial campaign threatens free speech, arguing that the First Amendment does not protect fraud, and comparing fossil fuel companies to the tobacco industry.
Still active are at least two subpoenas filed against Exxon, one issued by Mr. Schneiderman and another by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who has demanded documents and communications with a dozen universities and nonprofits going back 40 years.

"First the banks lost the public’s trust, then the tax activities of some large corporations were brought under scrutiny. So perhaps taking on the “big six” UK energy companies as household fuel bills incessantly rise is a natural next step for Ed Miliband to make headlines and try to win over voters. In fact in his open letter to the energy companies today he wrote that the public have “lost faith in this market”, and that there is “a crisis of confidence”. But his proposal to freeze energy bills for 20 months while the energy market undergoes reform may be more a sticking plaster on a policy, rather than a market, that isn’t working. Household energy policy has changed significantly over the past 10 years. The coalition government scrapped treasury-funded schemes to support those most vulnerable to fuel poverty (defined until last month as a household needing to spend more than 10% of income on heating). Under schemes such as Warm Front, eligible households - usually those with poor energy efficiency and low incomes - received improvements like free insulation or a new boiler. This was aimed at reducing energy bills and working towards climate change commitments by reducing carbon emissions. At the same time the energy companies had a number of social and environmental commitments, such as providing household insulation for free, and in some cases supporting the retrofit of entire houses. Since the 2010 election, energy companies have been under greater financial pressure to support those households in fuel poverty, and those in particularly inefficient, un-insulated homes that are hard to tackle and therefore costly to live in. The cost to do so is now met from energy bills rather than general taxation.  This move has been highly criticised. For example, Sir John Hills, leading the fuel poverty review, commented that: “since energy expenditure makes up a large proportion of overall spending for lower-income households, this increase in energy costs represents a relatively regressive means of funding a policy.” Fuel poverty charity National Energy Action has argued that it was “perverse” that as fuel poverty and carbon emissions rise, those households struggling most pay a disproportionate amount through fuel bills, rather than a more proportional rate via progressive taxation. The UK has legally binding obligations to both reduce fuel poverty and address climate change. At a glance these two aspects of energy policy might appear to be in conflict with each other. An increase in household energy use may reduce fuel poverty but lead to increased carbon emissions, whereas climate change policies aimed at reducing energy use by increasing bills may increase fuel poverty. But improving the insulation and energy efficiency of Britain’s notoriously leaky housing stock is seen as the most effective way of meeting these goals simultaneously. Miliband’s proposed price freeze, on the other hand, is a short-term measure that ignores the issues of poor quality housing. Without addressing these, it will be hard to meet the carbon reduction climate goals, jeopardising the chance to improve housing and help lower energy bills in the future. The “big six” energy companies cannot be held solely responsible for rising household energy bills. Given the legal commitments to reducing fuel poverty and carbon emissions perhaps Ed Miliband should reconsider what role the government should play in delivering social and environmental policies, instead of offloading the responsibilities to the private sector. Improvements to the housing stock and targeted support for those in most need are perhaps more effective ways of addressing these legal commitments, rather than a short-term freeze in prices."
"The EU banned the use of neonicotinoid pesticides for two years in April, after a sustained campaign by beekeepers, green groups and environmental organisations across Europe. These groups are convinced that the neonicotinoid class of insecticides are the main cause of the collapse of honeybee numbers seen across much of the world, dating back to at least the 1990s, but accelerating since 2006. The UK government was among the minority of states that voted against the ban, having issued briefs against it throughout the debate. While the ban was a significant victory for the beekeepers and their allies, it’s only for two years and the scientific evidence on both sides is fiercely contested. This is by no means the end of the story. Among those researching the field of science, technology and society, it is argued that scientific knowledge is never just about facts, but also about power. Facts are not simply discovered by science as absolute truths, but are instead constructed in social contexts that are riddled with power relations. As the old adage suggests, knowledge and power are always intertwined. What becomes a fact and what does not is a social and political issue that is concerned with what kind of knowledge - and importantly whose knowledge - acquires legitimacy and therefore authority. Thinking about the debate over neonicotinoids in these terms is revealing: many French beekeepers became convinced more than a decade ago that the worsening trend of honeybee losses was linked to the introduction of Gaucho, a brand of products from the German agro-chemical company Bayer that contains Imidacloprid, a widely used neonicotinoid. Their campaign against these products went international in 2007 after researchers at Pennsylvania State University looking into the causes of particularly dramatic bee losses in the US the previous autumn, produced a report in which they named the condition Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). This new term was picked up and quickly became ubiquitous in media reports worldwide. Its apocalyptic overtones caught the public imagination, so that CCD came to be perceived as an unprecedented and urgent crisis not only of honeybees but of pollination, threatening agriculture and food production. This helped to create the conditions in which the anti-neonicotinoid campaign was able to enlist many more allies, until it was strong enough to achieve the considerable coup of out-lobbying the big pesticide companies within the EU legislative process, if not within all member states. The relationship between the politics and science of CCD is complex. Despite ongoing research, neonicotinoids have not yet been shown to be a convincing, sole cause of CCD. Instead the emerging scientific view is that the problem is a complex, multi-causal phenomenon. The interaction of various pesticides with each other and other factors serve to ratchet up the existing threats posed to honeybees from parasites and viruses. In the absence of a smoking gun, two political approaches have emerged. One is to insist that more research is needed, as a toxin must be shown to be specifically responsible before it can be withdrawn. This is the UK and US government stance. The other is to adopt the precautionary principle, which argues that if there is good reason to suspect a toxin then it should be withdrawn while further research is carried out. This is the position that underpins the EU’s recent decision. Some science studies scholars have argued that the first of these positions ignores and de-legitimises the practical expertise and knowledge of beekeepers in favour of a narrow conception of scientific authority. Whereas the precautionary principle acknowledges that in complex cases those practitioners working “on the ground” may sometimes have the edge over laboratory scientists. Ruling out other forms of knowledge as “unscientific” is typical of what James Scott has called “seeing like a state”, whereby techno-bureaucracies impose top-down schemes rooted in “expert” ways of knowing and doing that are divorced from the real intricacies of practical experience. This can often lead to huge waste and inefficiency, abject failure, and sometimes even disaster. Yet the UK government is not averse to dismissing scientific expertise in favour of practical wisdom when it suits, as illustrated by its recent insistence on culling badgers to appease disgruntled farmers in spite of expert advice that this will do very little to reduce bovine TB. So there is more to this than a preference for science over other forms of knowledge, and sociologist Ulrich Beck’s theory of risk society provides a further way to understand what may be going on. Beck argues that in contemporary societies the social mechanisms for managing the risks of industrial technologies have broken down. Once risks were managed by the institutions of insurance, precautionary after-care and the polluter-pays principle. But in the nuclear, chemical and biotechnological age, risks have become so pervasive and so great in magnitude that they are effectively incalculable, individual polluters often unidentifiable, and precautionary after-care rendered meaningless. Society is essentially uninsured. The vacuum is filled by the dogma of technological infallibility, and by the denial or normalisation of risk. Consequently every accident corrodes public confidence in scientific authority and political integrity. It becomes much easier then to see why the anti-pesticide campaign has grown much faster than the specific evidence against neonicotinoids, and it is not just an anthropomorphic response to lovable, stripey little bees. It draws upon a much deeper public anxiety concerning the risks to human, animal and ecological health associated with techno-scientific progress, and the willingness of politicians and regulatory institutions to manage such risks in the interests of the public, rather than those of powerful corporations and lobbyists. As honeybee losses continue at an unsustainable rate, the US and UK governments’ rejection of the precautionary principle suggests such anxiety is by no means unwarranted.

By drip-feeding information and up-grading our Covid-19 status on a weekly basis, the government is stretching out the pain for every New Zealander.



Each announcement has resulted in a mad rush for the supermarkets from that same old panic buying group that has to get in ahead of everybody else – just in case. You know, the selfish ones who have no consideration for anybody else, least of all for the vulnerable among us who are already struggling.



The government really does need to show some courage and act quickly in the best interests of all New Zealanders. That means going for Level 4 right **NOW**.



What do we have to lose? What does the government have to lose?



At this stage, the facts are clear, far clearer than they are for the climate change nonsense which they’ve already signed up to, yet they seem reluctant to do the one thing that will save New Zealand from a whole domino effect of crises that the world experience says will happen sometime in the next week to ten days.



The question is whether we do it in the easiest and most effective way by striking right now, or do we wait and see what happens and react when it happens?



Business is grinding to a standstill and many New Zealanders are at risk of losing their livelihoods. By acting **NOW,** government can be proactive and nip the cursed thing in the bud. Within a matter of weeks or a month or two, we will be back on the road to economic and health recovery.



If we leave it, we could end up like Italy. The process could take months or even years and people will die. Not just people who catch the Covid-19 virus, but others who will be unable to access our health system because it will be swamped.



I note in a newspaper that **Dr Kelvin Ward** , a front line medic, has authored a petition asking the Government to raise the alert level to the highest possible **NOW**



Almost 3,000 people, including front-line health workers, are petitioning the Government to activate Covid-19 Alert Level Four immediately. 



The petition’s author, Dr Kelvin Ward, said raising the alert to the highest possible level was the only way for New Zealand to ensure it survives the virus with minimal impact. 



As of 3pm, 2,900 had signed the petition calling for: 



Quarantine, not self-isolation, of all Covid-19 positive patients



Extensive testing and contact tracing 



Self-isolation of all asymptomatic contacts



Mandatory social lockdown 



“If we want to prevent this epidemic becoming exponential, we have to take some drastic measures,” Ward said. 



“We know that there is a burden of disease in the community which hasn’t been detected and we will not know that burden until days, or weeks, later.” 



Just what I and several others have been saying all along.



 **Let’s get on with it. Show some leadership government.** **It’s been too little too late for too long!**

Pair was allegedly pocketing the money given by NASA for their startup instead of paying graduate students to do the work
From AP and web reports:

Professor, Wife Sentenced After Defrauding NASA
The duo told NASA that their startup company would develop a cutting-edge sensor used to track climate change. Instead, prosecutors alleged, they used the company to funnel money to themselves.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A university professor in Pennsylvania has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison on a conviction of defrauding NASA by letting graduate students and researchers do all the work on a $700,000 project.
U.S. District Court Judge Harvey Bartle III also ordered Yujie Ding on Wednesday to pay a fine of $3,000 and restitution of $72,000. His wife, Yuliya Zotova, was sentenced to three months in prison.
Authorities said the Lehigh University engineering professor and his wife told NASA that their startup company ArkLight would develop a cutting-edge sensor used to track climate change. Instead, prosecutors alleged, they used the company “as a front to funnel federal grant money to themselves for research performed by students and others.”
Jurors convicting the couple of six of 10 fraud counts.
http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a827b865066d491b8095605e6f5ee0ea/professor-wife-sentenced-convictions-defrauding-nasa

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, from August 2009 through July 2010, the pair submitted proposals to NASA seeking research funding by claiming that their business, ArkLight, was doing research and subcontracting work to Lehigh University where Ding was a professor.
Instead, an investigation found that the pair used ArkLight “as a front to funnel federal grant money to themselves for research performed by students and others working under Ding’s supervision at his university lab.”
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the defendants sent invoices to NASA for research that, a jury found, ArkLight had not participated in.

The latest installment of the ongoing melodrama about global warming occurred this week with the release of the Clinton administration’s “U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change for the Nation.” 



To be sure, there will be some upsides to warming (primarily greater agricultural yields), but for the most part, the report predicts doom and gloom for the coming century. 



While the press is eating this stuff up (“End Is Near!” makes a pretty good headline), the public is showing remarkably good judgment by heavily discounting these prophesies of apocalypse. 



Let’s start by considering how hard it is to forecast the weather, even for the upcoming weekend. Then consider the hit‐​and‐​miss nature of predictions about what kind of summer or winter might be in store for us in any given year. Then ponder the difficulties of predicting weather patterns 100 years out. It boggles the mind, particularly when we reflect on all the industrial and technological changes that will heavily influence the extent of greenhouse gas emissions and our ability to mitigate them. The assessment, to its credit, frankly acknowledges the uncertainties, but they are noted in passing and not allowed to intrude on the parade of horribles that march through the report. 



Surprisingly, the report begins by postulating a 5‐​to‐​10 degree Fahrenheit warming over this century, a range far higher than that predicted by the computer models used in the report (which predicted warming between 3.6 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit). Moreover, there are two fundamental problems with the assumptions relied on by the computers. 



First, the report’s computer modelers postulated a 1 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions each year, a figure two‐​and‐​a‐​half times greater than the observed 0.4 percent annual increase in emissions over the past two decades. Even the somewhat‐​alarmist International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts only an annual 0.63 percent emissions increase over this century. That simple error alone reduces the warming predicted in the assessment by one‐​third to one‐​half. 



Second, the models assume that warming will dramatically accelerate in the future because air pollution from sulfate aerosols, which is thought to artificially cool the planet, will decrease. Yet the “sulfate‐​masking” hypothesis has been torn to shreds by scientists in the peer‐​reviewed literature, and even NASA’s James Hansen, perhaps the world’s foremost expert on climate change, no longer believes that pollution is temporarily protecting us from the full brunt of global warming. 



The report generates most of its disaster scenarios by assuming a relatively even distribution of this dramatic warming, but the data clearly show that warming has thus far been fairly modest and almost entirely concentrated in the far northern latitudes, at night and during the winter. 



There’s good reason for this: Cold, dry air masses warm faster and to a greater extent than moist air for any given increment of greenhouse gas emissions. 



Moreover, warming moist air increases cloud cover, which reduces temperatures during the day but increases them at night. Most climatologists believe that warming nighttime winter temperatures in the north would result in benign or largely positive changes in climate. 



Finally, there is the report’s dubious prediction that warmer weather will cause more extreme weather events. Even the IPCC notes that there is no evidence that extreme weather events are more likely now than they were in the past, despite the century‐​long buildup of greenhouse gases. In fact, the number of storms and other extreme weather events, along with their severity, are trending down, not up. One can find just as many peer‐​reviewed articles arguing that those downward trends will continue as articles arguing the opposite. 



It should surprise no one that the “national assessment” has political fingerprints all over it. A senior scientist involved in the project told The New York Times that the report’s conclusions are still subject to revision but that the administration was determined to release the summary now to affect the November elections. The summary itself plays up the degree of “stakeholder involvement” in the development of the report, a clear signal that politically active interest groups had a hand in the document. 



And not surprisingly, the press releases accentuate the negative, even though the report concludes that, despite these worst‐​case assumptions about warming trends, society will likely have little trouble adjusting to climate‐​induced changes. 



The assessment, in sum, sheds more heat than light on the future impact of climate change. But in an election year, what else should we really expect?

According to _The Hill_, yesterday Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer (D-CA) told reporters, “I am going to form a climate change caucus, because people are coming up to me, they really want to get into this. I think Sandy changed a lot of minds.”   
  
  
Changed a lot of minds about what? As I have pointed out, the link between “superstorm” Sandy and anthropogenic climate change is weak, and weaker still is our understanding of whether climate change strengthened or weakened Sandy. But regardless of whether or not human greenhouse gas emissions impacted Sandy in some detectable way, it is certain that Congressional attempts to drive down U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will have absolutely zero detectable impact of such storm systems, and any other type of extreme weather you can think of.   
  
  
Why? Because, as I have shown, under business‐​as‐​usual scenarios, the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are only expected to be responsible for maybe 7% of the total global human greenhouse effect impact over the course of this century. Detecting a human impact on extreme weather systems is already hard enough (due to human‐​signal to natural‐​noise ratio problems), and detecting only 7% of it is impossible (and 7% is the best case scenario if all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions forever ceased starting tomorrow, which, I can assure you, will not be the case).   
  
  
Sandy is a poor excuse to pursue even poorer legislation.

The next few weeks are crucial. Australians can choose to assist the creation of the World Carbon Rationing, Tax and Redistribution Authority, administered by the United Nations, or we can take a step on the road back to energy and climate sanity.
The first step to sanity is to ensure that the opposition votes at all times to REJECT whatever Ration-N-Tax Scheme the Rudd government tries to get on the law books before the Copenhagen Climate Conclave. We must give no encouragement whatsoever to this international cabal of levellers.
Malcolm Turnbull and the warmist wing of the Liberal Party think that they are being politically savvy and achieving something useful by negotiating with the devil on a few clauses of the ETS (Extra Tax System). In matters as crucial as this, compromise is defeat.

From San Diego State University and the “say anything to support the cause” department, comes this press release written by a fellow who obviously does not understand what it means when researchers say: “[methane and carbon dioxide release] is highest in the Arctic during the region’s cold season“. Maybe now those alarmists like Paul Beckwith and the always wrong on sea ice expert Peter Wadhams can call off their “Arctic Methane Emergency Group” who say the warming during summer is the biggest problem.
Yet here we are, actual measurements say that methane and CO2 release are contrary to what climate models predict about thawing permafrost releasing methane. Obviously some other mechanism is going on if permafrost is releasing equal or greater amounts of methane during winter as it does during summer..
Last year their press release said:
…found that far more methane is escaping from Arctic tundra during the cold months—when the soil surface is frozen (generally from September through May)—as well as from upland tundra, than prevailing assumptions and climate modelers previously believed. In fact, they found that at least half of the annual methane emissions occur in the cold months, and that drier, upland tundra can be a larger emitter of methane than wet tundra. The finding challenges critical assumptions in current global climate models.
With the new study from Kwon et al. cited in the press release below, Kwon finds the same thing for CO2 release – more in the cold season.
So if half or more of Methane and CO2 release is happening when the ground is frozen, that rather puts the damper on worries that summer warming is going to set off a runaway greenhouse effect, at least that’s how I read it. Yet here with are with that exact title from SDSU’s press release today. It seems to me that their thinking is backwards, as they seem worried that now there is more methane and carbon dioxide release in the winter than they previously knew about, that this just adds to the volume of the alarm, rather than pointing to something being wrong in model assumptions and assumptions about feedback mechanisms.

Runaway Global Warming

SDSU biologist Donatella Zona comments on a startling new finding in climate change research.
 

By Michael Price
 

The steady march of global warming over the past century has led to the thawing of permafrost—a layer of subsurface soil in the Arctic that usually remains frozen year-round. While that’s troubling for local ecosystems, it could have disastrous global impacts as well. As this permafrost melts, it sets off a biochemical chain reaction in the soil that could dramatically increase the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, accelerating further climate change. San Diego State University biologist Donatella Zona wrote about this issue in a commentary article this week in the journal Nature.
In her commentary, she provides expert perspective on recent findings published in the journal Biogeosciences by Min Jung Kwon of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. Kwon and her team report that the layer of permafrost typically acts as a barrier against moisture drainage in the soil. As this permafrost melts, the moisture drains out, leaving the top layers of the soil drier and warmer. This warming kick-starts a biochemical process within organic matter present in the soil that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading contributors to warming global temperatures.
“The authors report that the net effect of draining in their study is an increase in the amount of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere, which will ultimately magnify climate change,” Zona wrote in her commentary.
Zona published a study about the effects of drainage in permafrost earlier this year in the journal Nature Geoscience. Additionally, she and fellow SDSU ecologist Walt Oechel, along with colleagues at several other institutions, published another study last year showing that the emission of methane, another greenhouse gas, is highest in the Arctic during the region’s cold season. That was surprising, as most scientists thought little if any greenhouse gases escaped the frozen soil during the cold season.
Sure enough, Kwon’s recent study shows a similar trend for carbon dioxide.
“Importantly, Kwon and colleagues show the increase is highest during the cold season, a notoriously under-studied part of the year in tundra ecosystems,” Zona wrote.
More data is needed to better understand the long-term implications of these findings on larger climate change patterns, Zona said. But that’s difficult, as funding for such studies is scarce.
“Unfortunately, given the costs of doing research in this region, funding agencies tend to support projects of only 3–5 years—hardly long enough to provide even a first glimpse of the impact of climate change,” she wrote. “Long-term studies would be possible only through a collaboration of research groups, with several funding agencies sharing the financial burden.”

"**Hundreds of thousands of people in Hong Kong have voted in pro-democracy primaries, despite warnings that doing so may breach a new security law.**
The two-day vote will determine the opposition candidates for September's elections to the legislative council.
But it is being widely viewed as a test of opposition to the controversial new law that took effect last month.
The law, which gives the Chinese state new powers over the city, drew widespread international condemnation.
China has said the law is necessary to prevent the type of protests seen in Hong Kong during much of 2019, but its critics say it severely curtails freedoms guaranteed to Hongkongers for 50 years after British rule ended in Hong Kong in 1997.
On Sunday, thousands of voters queued for a second day at more than 250 polling stations around the city. Opposition activists had hoped for a high turnout, and early estimates suggested that it had exceeded their expectations.
Organisers set a target of 170,000 voters across the weekend, but officials said more than 500,000 people had taken part as of Sunday afternoon.
The voters turned out despite one senior Chinese official suggesting last week that participation in the primary could breach the new security law.
""Those who have organised, planned or participated in the primary election should be wary and avoid carelessly violating the law,"" Erick Tsang, the Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs, told the Sing Tao Daily newspaper.
Sunny Cheung, one of the candidates, told the Reuters news agency that a high turnout would ""send a very strong signal to the international community, that we Hong Kongers never give up"".
Eddie Chu, an opposition pro-democracy politician, called the vote a ""proxy referendum against the national security law"".
The full turnout is expected to be announced early on Monday, with results coming shortly after. But there are fears among opposition activists that the authorities will move to prevent some candidates from running in September.
""They can arrest or disqualify any candidate they don't like under the national security law without a proper reason,"" said Owen Chow, a young democratic candidate.
The new, wide ranging law:"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman wind energy protest site windwahn.com here presents a brand new paper showing that infrasound-induced changes in brain activity is made visible and proven.
The findings thus suggest that the health impacts by the low-frequency sound waves generated by industrial wind turbines in fact do adversely affect human health, a claim that has often been denied by Big Wind.

Fig. 1: The new paper by Weichenberger et al: “Altered cortical and subcortical connectivity due to infrasound administered near the hearing threshold – Evidence from fMRI”
Some lobbyists and proponents even went on to say that it was all in people’s heads. Well it turns out that this is true, but it’s real!
The groundbreaking paper by Markus Weichenberger and scientists at the Charité (Berlin), the PTB (Braunschweig) and the UKE (Hamburg) is comprehensive and was published on April 12, 2017.
The study used advanced brain imaging to compare activity for infrasound near the hearing threshold.

Fig. 2: Results of whole-brain contrast regional homogeneity (ReHo) maps acquired during near-threshold vs. no-tone condition.
The paper’s conclusion is not what the wind industry and green energy proponents want to hear:
To our knowledge, this study is the first to document changes of brain activity across several regions in response to prolonged near-threshold IS using fMRI*. ReHo analysis revealed higher local connectivity of rSTG, ACC and the rAmyg only when IS was administered near the hearing threshold and ICA showed that effects can also be found on the inter-regional level. On the one hand, these results seem to support the hypothesis that (sub-)liminal IS can exert an influence on the organism via a subconscious processing route (which supposedly involves outer hair cell-mediated signal transduction). On the other hand, though clearly audible, prolonged stimulation with IS above the hearing threshold did not lead to changes of brain activity, which could indicate that the signal processed along the conscious hearing route may have been attenuated in a top-down fashion via attentional mechanisms.
Also, since the brain’s response to prolonged near-threshold IS involves the activation of brains areas, which are known to play a crucial role in emotional and autonomic control, a potential link between IS-induced changes of brain activity and the emergence of various physiological as well as psychological health effects can be established. Transient upregulation of these brain areas in response to below- or near threshold IS may thus reflect an initial stress response of the body, eventually promoting symptom formation as stimulation occurs repeatedly and additional risk factor come into play. Nevertheless, further research, in particular longitudinal exposure research, is needed in order substantialize these findings and contribute to a better understand of IS-related health effects.
Expect the pressure to mount to make wind park setback distances from residential areas greater.

In recent months, White House science adviser John Holdren has repeatedly pushed the link between extreme weather events and human‐​caused climate change well beyond the bounds of established science. Now, veteran climate scientists are pushing back.





The White House science adviser confuses global‐​warming fact and fancy.



Mr. Holdren’s efforts started in January, as much of the nation was shivering in the midst of an excursion of arctic air into the lower 48 states.



Anyone with a passing interest in the climate of the United States knows that is hardly an unusual occurrence (“citrus freeze” anyone?), but outfit the chill with a new, scarier‐​sounding moniker and a blase‐​sounding “cold‐​air outbreak” goes viral as the “polar vortex.”



Apparently, sensing the time was ripe for a bit of global‐​warming alarmism, the White House released a video titled “The Polar Vortex Explained in 2 Minutes,” featuring Mr. Holdren describing how “a growing body of evidence suggests that the kind of extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States as we speak is a pattern that we can expect to see with increasing frequency as global warming continues.”



Although this statement is not outright false, it is, at its very best, a half‐​truth — and a stretch at that. In fact, there is an ever‐​larger and faster‐​growing body of evidence that directly disputes Mr. Holdren’s contention.



This was pointed out last month in a letter to Science magazine authored by five veteran climate scientists, who are all experts in the field of atmospheric circulation patterns.



The scientists disputed Mr. Holdren’s explanation, writing that “we do not view the theoretical arguments underlying it to be compelling” and concluded that while such research “deserves a fair hearing to make it the centerpiece of the public discourse is inappropriate and a distraction.”



One of the letter’s authors, atmospheric science professor John Wallace from the University of Washington, even wrote a guest post at the popular Capital Weather Gang blog run by _The Washington Post_ , to proclaim, “I disagree with those who argue that we need to capitalize on recent extreme weather events to raise public awareness of human‐​induced global warming.”



Such pushback didn’t stop Mr. Holdren, though.



A couple of weeks ago at a congressional hearing, Mr. Holdren attacked the views of University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. concerning the connection between anthropogenic global warming and the ongoing drought in the Southwest.



Mr. Pielke, an expert on the relationship between natural disasters and climate change, had previously testified to Congress that the best science regarding many types of extreme weather, including hurricanes, tornados, floods and droughts, indicated no detectable tie‐​in to global warming.



Mr. Holdren described Mr. Pielke’s views as being outside of “mainstream scientific opinion” and submitted a six‐​page explanation to the Senate subcommittee describing why he thought so, focusing on drought and specifically California drought (a copy of which was also posted at the White House website).



In response, Mr. Pielke defended himself, laying out a strong and overwhelming scientific case in a lengthy essay for The New Republic and accusing Mr. Holdren of “wielding his political position to delegitimize an academic whose views he finds inconvenient.”



Mr. Pielke was not alone in his defense. Recently, Martin Hoerling, lead scientist of the Interpreting Climate Conditions Team of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, expressed surprise at Mr. Holdren’s response to Mr. Pielke in the DotEarth blog hosted by _The New York Times_.



Mr. Hoerling wrote that the type of drought currently facing California “has been observed before” and that “[i]t is quite clear that the scientific evidence does not support an argument that this current California drought is appreciably, if at all, linked to human‐​induced climate change.”



In his State of the Union address, President Obama called for “more urgency” in combating climate change, and with his Climate Action Plan — his attempt to regulate carbon‐​dioxide emissions by fiat — a central theme to his legacy, we have to wonder just who is advising who?



Is the president giving orders to his science adviser to make the case that carbon‐​dioxide emissions are the cause of weather disasters in the United States despite the best science that argues otherwise? Or is his science adviser misinforming the president as to what the collection of science actually says, leading him to pursue carbon‐​dioxide regulation where it is not needed?



In either case, the situation is badly in need of repair.

"**Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody.**
Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC.
Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of unrest, with widespread looting and buildings set alight.
How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent?
Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can ""become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community,"" says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University.
Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds.
Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police.
This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise.
Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say.
""Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,"" says Prof Stott.
For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police.
However, ""police often react towards the crowd as a whole"" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their ""us versus them"" mentality.
This ""can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances.""
Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US ""ramped up their aggressiveness"" over the weekend.
""Deploying the National Guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation.""
It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent.
Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational.
Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism.
Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University.
A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so ""when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected"".
""This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace"", because ""if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable.""
This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says.
Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds.
In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend.
However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are ""irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part"".
""To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police.""
Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting ""often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies"", he says.
Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.
He says there is ""a long history of targeting, or selectivity"", in vandalism and looting. ""In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those.""
However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals.
The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others.
In Hong Kong, for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting.
Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality.
""Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,"" says Dr Ho. ""It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message.""
Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key.
""Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,"" says Prof Stott.
Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that ""one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them.""
More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation.
Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution.
Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated.
""You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,"" he says.
""The George Floyd case was not the cause - it's more like the straw that broke the camel's back. You could argue even the police killings are symptoms - the underlying cause is white supremacy, racism, and things the US has not fundamentally dealt with."""

Robbie Andrew from the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo has created an interesting animated graph showing the growth of CO2 in the atmosphere. While it has the typical “climate proponent” view attached to it, it is interesting to watch because it clearly shows how CO2 jumps faster when ENSO is strongly positive.
He writes:

Drivers of Atmospheric CO2

 

Discussion
While we measure the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere in mere parts per million (ppm), this small amount has a substantial effect on the temperature at the surface of the Earth. The amount has now increased by 40% since the industrial revolution, leading directly to increased temperatures worldwide.
There are four main drivers of the changes in the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.
The seasonal cycle
The first is the seasonal cycle, dominated by the forests of the northern hemisphere, absorbing CO2 via photosynthesis in summer and spring, and then, in autumn and winter, the decay of their fallen leaves to release some of that CO2 back into the atmosphere. This cycle can be seen here as a pulse, sometimes imagined as the planet ‘breathing’.
Emissions
The second most important driver is our emissions from burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This transfers carbon that has been stored for a very long time underground into the atmosphere in the form of CO2. Nature partially compensates for this increased level of CO2, with both forests and oceans absorbing more (the latter leading to acidification of the oceans), but this amounts to only a little over half of the new CO2, with 44% of each year’s emissions remaining in the atmosphere.
The El Niño Southern Oscillation
The third driver is often referred to as El Niño, or more correctly as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO describes a naturally occurring cycle of pressure and temperature differences across the width of the Pacific Ocean. In El Niño years there tend to be more droughts in important forested areas, and that reduces the productivity of forests, in turn reducing their absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. The drier conditions can also lead to increased wildfires, sending even more CO2 into the atmosphere. Strong El Niño conditions can be seen in here 1983, 1988, 1998, and 2015.
Volcanoes
The fourth major driver is the periodic eruption of volcanoes, the most significant of which in the last few decades was Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines in June of 1991. The enormous amount of fine debris thrown into the atmosphere – probably the largest since Krakatoa in 1883 – stayed there for many months, blocking sunlight, reducing global temperatures by about 0.6°C, but also increasing diffuse sunlight, which stimulates tree canopy growth, with the overall effect of increased natural carbon sinks. Note that it’s not about the CO2 volcanoes emit when they erupt: Pinatubo emitted about 50 MtCO2 in 1991, compared with our own emissions of about 29000 MtCO2 in the same year.
Relative effects
The relative effects of ENSO and our emissions on the growth of atmospheric CO2 can be determined by analysis of these data. The bars at the bottom of the animation above show these effects, with the effect of emissions being always positive and growing, while that of ENSO flicks between positive and negative depending on whether the planet is currently in El Niño (to the right) or La Niña (to the left). The effect of the sea-surface temperatures used to measure ENSO on measured atmospheric CO2 is delayed by several months because of the natural processes involved. The year 2015 was a particularly strong El Niño year, and, when combined with our record-high emissions, atmospheric CO2 levels rose more sharply than usual.
Sources
NOAA releases weekly average concentrations of CO2 measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii here. These data are similar to, but not the same as, estimates of global average concentration. Mauna Loa data are often used because they are the longest set of measured data.
Global emissions data are from the Global Carbon Project.
ENSO temperature data are from the Hadley Centre’s Sea Surface Temperature dataset HadSST.3.1. Note that data for October 2016 were not available at the time of writing.
For the relative effects of ENSO and emissions I have relied on the relationship found by Richard Betts and colleagues.

Anthony adds:
One thing worth noting is that Mr. Andrew’s opinion about the nature of ENSO and climate differs from the view of the NOAA ESRL author of this graph:

Klaus Wolter says:
El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most important coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on interannual time scales.
Source: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/
What is clear from his MEI graph above, is that since 1976, we’ve spent far more time in the positive (warmer) phase of ENSO than we have in the blue (colder) phase. This is backed up by a BAMS paper in 2005 by Hartmann and Wendler, who say this about the climate of Alaska:
The 1976 Pacific climate shift is examined, and its manifestations and significance in Alaskan climatology during the last half-century are demonstrated. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation index shifted in 1976 from dominantly negative values for the 25-yr time period 1951–75 to dominantly positive values for the period 1977–2001.
Mean annual and seasonal temperatures for the positive phase were up to 3.1°C higher than for the negative phase.
This shift not only translates to Pacific ocean warming and subsequent climatological effects in Alaska, but also outgassing of CO2 due to CO2 having less solubility in warmer water (think warm soda pop).
Roger Andrews noted this in 2012 in a comment left at Tallbloke’s Talkshop:
The graph compares ICOADS global SST anomalies with the Mauna Loa CO2 record, with both records 12-month smoothed to remove seasonality. The scales are adjusted so that CO2 visually tracks SST.

To illustrate the change in SST, I’ve added arrows to show the dramatic change in slope that occurred in the mid to late 70’s with SST.

The breakpoint in 1976/77 is known as the Great Pacific Climate shift, and was identified in a paper by Ebbesmeyer et. al in 1990.
In 2009, WUWT published a press release about the paper:
“Surge in global temperatures since 1977 can be attributed to a 1976 climate shift in the Pacific Ocean”
“The surge in global temperatures since 1977 can be attributed to a 1976 climate shift in the Pacific Ocean that made warming El Niño conditions more likely than they were over the previous 30 years and cooling La Niña conditions less likely” says corresponding author de Freitas.
“We have shown that internal global climate-system variability accounts for at least 80% of the observed global climate variation over the past half-century. It may even be more if the period of influence of major volcanoes can be more clearly identified and the corresponding data excluded from the analysis.”
The paper: http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JD011637.shtml
So while CO2 emissions have certainly increased globally since 1958…so has the positive effect of ENSO. One has to wonder what the climate argument would be like today had the great Pacific Climate Shift not occurred. I’m betting that Dr. James Hansen would not have testified in 1988 about global warming, or need to turn off the air conditioner in the hearing room to dramatize his point, but likely would have been more concerned about cooling.

The Greens initial party list has been released. _Stuff_ reports:



An initial list for the Green Party puts activist Teanau Tuiono ahead of several sitting MPs in the party.



The Green Party list will dictate which of their MPs enter Parliament after the next election, should they win over five per cent of the vote.



The ranking of the list is voted on by members in two different stages – first by delegates at a conference for an initial list and then by all 7000 or so Green Party members closer to the election.



The initial list, seen by _Stuff_ , puts co-leader Marama Davidson at number one, followed by co-leader and climate change minister James Shaw at number 2, switching their rankings from the last election.



Ahead of Genter and sitting MPs Chlöe Swarbrick and Golriz Ghahraman is Tuiono at five.



The list is:



This brief spread sheet shows how much the Greens are ignoring their constitution’s rules about gender balance. 



The [Green Party Rules and Constitution](https://elections.nz/assets/Party-files/gp-candidate-selection-and-list-ranking.pdf) specify a quota on gender: “Gender – a maximum of 60% of candidates shall be male; a maximum of 60% of candidates shall be female. Gender is defined on the basis of the answer to the open question on the Parliamentary Candidate Declaration and Nomination forms.”



That’s right, there is a quota determined by whether or not someone has a penis. Perhaps Some of them are going to identify as men ahead of the election. If so that is going to make some of their anti-patriarchy statements made previously look as ludicrous as their whole party.



If the Greens get 5% the top six get in. With those six there would be a gender imbalance in contravention of their rules.



If they get 6% Chloe Swarbrick gets back. But the gender imbalance is still against the rules and getting worse.



If they get 7% Golriz Ghahraman is back also. The gender imbalance would now be well outside the rules.



If they don’t rectify this then they will look like hypocrites close to the election. Yet again this will be another case of politicians and political parties thinking that the rules don’t apply to them.



Will the Greens uphold their own constitution and sail into this election like they did the last one, in complete breach of their own rules?

"So serious are the effects of air pollution on human health - the WHO recently categorised it as carcinogenic, responsible for 223,000 deaths a year worldwide - that it is easy to neglect its wider impact. Air pollution damages ecosystems, building materials, and cultural heritage. While health is and will remain the key problem to be addressed, there has been renewed concern recently about the damage to electronic circuitry, particularly in highly polluted cities in India and China.  This was noticed 40 ago when Bell Laboratories realised that telephone switchboards had a shortened service life when used in polluted areas. Acidic air pollutants react with the electrical contacts made of copper and tin, causing a build up of corrosion products which interfere with electrical current, causing switches to fail. While this is clearly a problem, the reaction of air pollutants with the solid state components found in electronics also has some uses, for example as air pollution sensors. These still suffer from drift and low sensitivity, but one can envisage a future where tiny air pollution monitors could easily fit into a mobile phone and provide local air pollutant levels. The range of air pollution impacts not related to health is very large. In 2010 the world was surprised by the natural pollutants ejected into the atmosphere when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted in Iceland. This caused the most substantial disruption of air traffic in 50 years, with the transatlantic routes affected of such importance that it cost the airline industry an estimated US$1.7 billion. A number of serious incidents in the 1980s occurred when aircraft engines shut down after airliners ran through volcanic ash clouds. In response the International Civil Aviation Organisation began to use information provided by Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres to warn of airborne ash dangers. Where volcanic eruptions are very intense and explosive they can drive gases and dust high into the stratosphere, which can lower global temperatures and extend the whole in the ozone layer. Another much smaller “ozone hole”, but one that can be just as important on a personal level, was the discovery in the 1980s that the ozone produced in photochemical smog attacked the thin latex of condoms causing them to degrade after just a few days. It forced the industry to think about production and packaging. Chemically speaking, rubber (for example natural rubber, known as polyisoprene; CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2) has many double bonds that easily react and combine with ozone (O3). In a similar way, ozone-rich smogs can attack modern building materials such as plastic fittings, polymer coatings and sealants. Some metals, most notably copper and aluminium that are widely used in modern architecture, are sensitive to these oxidising pollutants typically found in cities. Our modern atmosphere is quite different from the smoke-filled air of cities in the past. The Roman poet Horace was much concerned about the smoke-begrimed temples of his ancient city. More than a thousand years later architect Christopher Wren described sulphate crusts on Westminster Abbey that had grown four inches thick from long exposure to coal smoke in London. Today buildings rarely exhibit such thick sulphate crusts as the days of coal have largely gone. Instead damage is more subtle. In the past the sulphur-laden coal smoke had also killed off lichen that attach to buildings. Now sulphur dioxide pollution has been replaced by nitrogen oxides, which form deposits on stone facades, essentially providing a fertiliser of sorts that encourages biological growth. Air pollutants can also leak indoors, and potentially damage objects in museums, art galleries and historic houses. To some extent the problem can be alleviated in museums and art galleries, but historic houses are not well suited to modern air conditioning. Even visitors themselves can be a source of damage - their presence changes the humidity of indoor air and they shed pollutant dust and fibres from their clothes as they move among the displays. The current enthusiasm for open displays means these deposited pollutants must be regularly cleaned off. However, the aesthetic impact of air pollution is not always negative. Some of the chemical reactions taking place in the atmosphere contribute to our appreciation of landscapes. Natural chemicals given off from trees, such as pinene from coniferous forests or eucalyptol from eucalyptus trees in Australia, react to form fine particles. In the case of eucalyptol, these particles scatter blue light, making distant objects appear blue – hence the appearance of the Blue Mountains. The importance of cool tones in depicting distant objects was described long ago by Leonardo da Vinci. In its own way air pollution has had a great impact on art. Take the abstraction evident in Monet’s paintings of Westminster done more than a century ago. He particularly chose to visit London in winter to capture the vivid colours of its famous polluted fog. Victorian fog became a metaphor for confusion and lack of clarity, hence its use in Sherlock Holmes stories. Even today it can be used to wield the same symbolism: in The King’s Speech, a film about King George VI and Lionel Logue, a confused Duke of York wanders off into the fog. Clearly, the effects of air pollution in all its forms is much broader than one would think."
"**US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has told Congress that Hong Kong no longer merits special treatment under US law.**
The declaration could have major implications for Hong Kong's trade hub status and is likely to anger Beijing.
""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,"" he said in a statement.
It follows Beijing's plan to impose a controversial new security law on the territory.
The security law was ""only the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms,"" Mr Pompeo said.
""It is now clear that China is modelling Hong Kong after itself,"" he added.
Hong Kong police have arrested hundreds of people amid new anti-mainland unrest.
Until now the US has given Hong Kong - a global financial and trading hub - special status under US law. The provision dates from when the territory was a British colony and gives it favourable trading terms.
But since last year this status has been conditional on the US secretary of state regularly certifying that Hong Kong maintains sufficient autonomy from mainland China.
If the secretary of state fails to certify this, the US Congress can revoke Hong Kong's special trade status.
This would mean treating Hong Kong the same as mainland China for trade and other purposes.
It could jeopardise billions of dollars worth of trade between Hong Kong and the US and could dissuade people from investing there in the future.
It would also hurt mainland China, which uses Hong Kong as a kind of middleman for transactions with the rest of the world. Mainland companies and multinational firms use the territory as an international or regional base.
Shortly after Mr Pompeo's declaration, prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong called on US, European and Asian leaders to follow his lead and reconsider Hong Kong's special trade status if Beijing imposes the security law.
""Once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections,"" he warned.
The security law would create ""massive damage to expats and investors in Hong Kong"", he said. Maintaining the city's autonomy was the ""only way"" to protect business, he added.
**Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington**
Mr Pompeo's latest declaration serves as a warning to Beijing that the special administrative region's preferential treatment is at risk.
It has huge economic implications, but the geopolitical implications may be even greater. The move will likely meet angry reaction from Beijing and further jeopardise already fragile US-China relations, which appear to be in free fall amid tensions over trade, the pandemic and technological rivalry.
A key question to ask is how much removing Hong Kong's special trade status helps Hongkongers fighting for their autonomy and freedoms. Or does it mostly punish people in Hong Kong while adding limited strategic leverage over China?
Beijing has proposed imposing it in Hong Kong.
It would ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion and China says it is needed to combat violent protests that have grown in the territory.
The anti-mainland sentiment was fuelled last year by a proposed - and later scrapped - bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to China.
Critics say the security law is a direct attempt to curtail the freedoms given Hong Kong in the mini-constitution that was agreed when sovereignty was handed back to China in 1997.
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has denied that the law, which is set to go to a vote this week and could be in force as early as the end of June, will curtail the rights of Hong Kong residents.
A group of 200 senior politicians from around the world have issued a joint statement criticising China's plan.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the US would announce a ""very powerful"" response to the proposed legislation before the end of the week. China's plans had already been condemned by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who described them as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms.
The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern""."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s first weekend in office unfolded much the way things often did during his campaign: with angry Twitter messages, a familiar obsession with slights and a series of meandering and at times untrue statements, all eventually giving way to attempts at damage control. The problem is that what works on the way to the White House does not always work once a candidate gets there. To the extent that there was a plan to take advantage of the first days of his administration, when a president is usually at his maximum leverage, Mr. Trump threw it aside with a decision to lash out about crowd sizes at his swearing in and to rewrite the history of his dealings with intelligence agencies. The lack of discipline troubled even senior members of Mr. Trump’s circle, some of whom had urged him not to indulge his simmering resentment at what he saw as unfair news coverage. Instead, Mr. Trump chose to listen to other aides who shared his outrage and desire to punch back. By the end of the weekend, he and his team were scrambling to get back on script. New presidents typically find the adjustment from candidate to leader to be a jarring one, and Mr. Trump was not the first to get drawn into the latest flap in a way that fritters away whatever political good will comes with an inauguration. Former President Bill Clinton got off to a tough start by engaging on issues that were not central to his agenda, most notably gays in the military, and took a while to learn how to focus on his highest priorities. But Mr. Clinton showed none of the combativeness and anger of Mr. Trump. “The adjustment from private citizen to running the country is unbelievably hard,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a longtime adviser to former President Barack Obama. He said that what people, even new presidents, often fail to fully understand “is that after you stand out there in the weather and take the oath of office in front of an adoring crowd, you walk into that building and you are in charge of the free world. ” At first, at least, Mr. Trump seemed to be resisting the notion that he should adjust his approach now that he is in office. After all, his pugilistic style was a winning formula, one that got him to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the first place. Many of his supporters cheer him taking on the establishment. And some allies said any blowback would not matter long anyway. “Ultimately this is about governing,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has advised Mr. Trump. “There are two things he’s got to do between now and 2020: He has to keep America safe and create a lot of jobs. That’s what he promised in his speech. If he does those two things, everything else is noise. ” “The average American isn’t paying attention to this stuff,” he added. “They are going to look around in late 2019 and early 2020 and ask themselves if they are doing better. If the answer’s yes, they are going to say, ‘Cool, give me some more. ’” That is the long view and ultimately perhaps the most important one. The short view from many political professionals is that Mr. Trump’s debut was not a success. The president himself seemed to be trying to find a way forward as the weekend proceeded. He danced to “My Way” on Friday night and did it his way on Saturday, but by Sunday he seemed to be trying something different. A day after waves of opponents gathered in Washington and cities around the nation and world to protest his presidency, Mr. Trump began Sunday still in a mood to push back. “Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election!” he posted on Twitter in the morning. “Why didn’t these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly. ” Kellyanne Conway, his counselor, contributed to the combative mood in an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd when she described the falsehoods that the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, had told reporters Saturday night as “alternative facts”  —   an assertion that lit up Twitter. However, Mr. Trump later adopted the more    demeanor that presidents typically take. “Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy,” he wrote on Twitter. “Even if I don’t always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views. ” Mr. Trump faces a challenge few of his predecessors have confronted. Having won an Electoral College victory but not the popular vote, he entered office with less public support in the polls than any other president in recent times. After a transition in which he did relatively little to reach out to his opponents on the left and they hardly warmed to him, he found hundreds of thousands of protesters chanting just a few blocks from his new home on the first morning he woke up there. That has left the new White House feeling besieged from Day 1, fueling the president’s grievances and, in the view of some of his aides, necessitating an aggressive strategy to defend his legitimacy. “The point is not the crowd size,” Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on “Fox News Sunday” before the mood began to soften. “The point is that the attacks and the attempts to delegitimize this president in one day  —   and we’re not going to sit around and take it. ” Mr. Trump grew increasingly angry on Inauguration Day after reading a series of Twitter messages pointing out that the size of his inaugural crowd did not rival that of Mr. Obama’s in 2009. But he spent his Friday night in a whirlwind of celebration and affirmation. When he awoke on Saturday morning, after his first night in the Executive Mansion, the glow was gone, several people close to him said, and the new president was filled anew with a sense of injury. He became even more agitated after learning of a pool report by a Time magazine reporter incorrectly reporting that a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. (The reporter, Zeke Miller, did not see the bust and, after realizing the error, quickly issued a correction and apology.) While Mr. Trump was eager to counterattack, several senior advisers urged him to move on and focus on the responsibilities of office during his first full day as president. That included a   trip to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency, where he had been coached to demonstrate support of the agency and criticize Senate Democrats for delaying confirmation of his nominee to lead it, Mike Pompeo. The advisers left thinking he agreed. But Mr. Spicer, who often berated reporters for what he called biased coverage during the campaign, shares Mr. Trump’s dark view of the news media and advocated an   declaration of war. After racing through his words of reconciliation at the C. I. A. in Langley, Va. Mr. Trump launched into a rambling, unscripted discussion that drifted to the topic of crowd size, making a series of verifiably false claims. Mr. Spicer then went to the White House briefing room for his first turn at the lectern and issued a blistering attack on reporters, made his own false claims and then stormed out without taking questions. Some of the president’s supporters found the first weekend troubling. L. Lin Wood, a prominent libel lawyer who was a vocal defender of Mr. Trump’s on Twitter during the campaign, said that he considered it a dangerous debut. “To someone who believed we might have a good opportunity to change, it’s just a terrible start. Because he’s got a long way to go,” Mr. Wood said. “This is going to go downhill quickly if it’s not changed, and that’s not good for any of us. ”"

“Do not quote or cite.” Stamp that phrase on a government document on global warming that’s still in peer review and you’re guaranteed to ignite climate change hysteria. That is especially true with magnum opus reports on the environment. The last United Nations compendium on global warming was published in 1996, but New York Times environmental reporter Bill Stevens had it above the fold in September 1995. Not surprisingly, one of the U.N. paper’s 1,000-odd reviewers had put it on the Internet, just hoping for exactly what happened. Stevens obliged, saying that “it was on the Internet, and therefore I felt I had to do it.” 



Stevens wrote that the upcoming report would contain “an important shift of scientific judgment” on human effects on the earth’s climate. In fact, the report’s centerpiece phrase, “The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate,” wasn’t officially inserted into the text until 20 minutes after midnight on November 30, 1995. Someone had leaked to Stevens not only text but also an additional, profoundly important sentence the U.N. had planned to insert after the peer review process had ended. 



The U.N. remains one of a handful of entities addicted to five‐​year plans. So, right on schedule, it posted the review draft of a new climate report, called the “Third Assessment Report” (TAR), on the Internet last month. This time the Washington Post’s Curt Suplee beat out his rival Stevens, who is busy trying to retire and sell his global warming book, A Change in the Weather, at the same time.



Suplee’s story quotes from the current draft of the TAR: “The observed warming of the last 100 years is exceptional and unlikely to be solely natural in origin” (emphasis added). The fragmentary quote is certainly a bit more incendiary than the whole cloth, but its use is repeating the effects of the 1995 leaks. That time around, Bruce Callendar, a senior official involved in producing that U.N. report, said, “All knew that the sentence [about a discernible human impact] would be the most widely quoted in the report.” Callendar went on to state that “some of the media conveyed this message to the public in a corrupted form, presenting it as proof that greenhouse gas emissions … could be blamed for contemporary weather extremes, from floods to droughts.”



Two of the most frequent “corrupters” are President Clinton and Vice President Gore, who are habituated to standing in front of every weather disaster and blaming global warming, unchallenged or uncorrected by either the U.N. or the hundreds of U.S. scientists who know better. Can anyone recall an instance in which a U.N. official stood up on television or wrote in a newspaper to denounce anyone who “corrupted” the 1996 statement? 



The U.N. is standing similarly mute this time around. But what would happen if someone spun back the U.N.‘s words in full, which state that the latest scientific research is too inaccurate to say how much of, or even whether, the warming of the last 100 years is caused by human activity?



At least that’s what the words “suggest” (no certainty) and “unlikely to be solely of natural origin” (we don’t know how much) mean.



I offer a guarantee, though: If any scientist proposed that explanation in the combined presence of a television camera and a U.N. official, he would be accused of not being a member of the U.N.‘s so‐​called consensus of scientists, despite what’s really in the TAR.



A final note with regard to the designation of “exceptional” climate: In the last 1,000 years, the warming of the last third of the 20th century has been equaled only once, by a similar warming in the first third of the same century. Never mind that humans hadn’t changed the greenhouse effect very much in that first instance. But think back — beyond the arbitrary 1,000-year time frame imposed by the TAR. Approximately 15,000 years ago, half of North America was covered by thousands of feet of ice. Before that, for 97 percent of the last 300 million years (1,000 years is 1/3,000 of that), the earth’s surface temperature averaged warmer than it is today.



What’s “exceptional”? Glaciers over Chicago or a nice May day in Washington? Who now is going to write the rest of the story, given that everyone has read that the current climate is “exceptional”? Save for a few scientists and journalists, only readers of this column know that the “exceptional” climate was merely “suggested” by scientific research and that it is “unlikely” to have been “solely natural.” But the whole truth isn’t what happens when we leak the TAR.

"**Top members of the US administration have warned that Hong Kong no longer merits a special status when it comes to trade, and the territory could be treated the same way as mainland China.**
Until now, the US has given Hong Kong favourable trading terms, dating back to the territory's time as a British colony, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Beijing ""will be held accountable"" for a new security law set to be imposed on Hong Kong.
The National Economic Council Director told CNBC, ""If need be, Hong Kong now may have to be treated the same way as China is treated, and that has implications for tariffs"".
So what will it mean if that special status is revoked?
Hong Kong is well-known as one of the world's most important financial centres. With a free economy and a competitive tax regime, it's attracted many multinational companies to its shores.
It's also an important hub for trade. But all of that could be in jeopardy, if the US changes the way it deals with Hong Kong.
**So what is the US threatening?**
At the moment, Hong Kong enjoys special trade relations with the US. It operates as a separate customs territory to mainland China. It also has a free port, meaning no tariffs are charged on the import or export of goods.
Those arrangements have helped Hong Kong become a centre for global trade. But now the US is threatening to treat Hong Kong the same as mainland China. That would mean its goods would be subject to additional tariffs, including those extra charges that were introduced as part of the US-China trade war, although some of those have recently been rolled back.
""Hong Kong has had a special trading relationship with different types of tariffs and regulations that have allowed it to trade in a freer way, particularly in relation to capital markets,"" said Dr Rebecca Harding, independent trade expert and CEO of Coriolis Technologies.
""The US has treated it as an ally, if you like. But it's now saying we are going to treat you in a similar way to how we treat China,"" she said.
**Where does that leave Hong Kong?**
Hong Kong is one of the world's top trading territories. In 2018 it was ranked with the 7th highest volume of trade with a total value of nearly $1.2tn.
But much of that trade is made up of goods that pass into, or come out of, mainland China.
In 2018, 8% of mainland China's exports to the US and 6% of mainland China's imports from the US, passed through Hong Kong.
This role as a gateway between the Chinese market and the rest of the world has put Hong Kong in a unique position, but different trade arrangements could change that.
""If there's a new trade regime in place, that changes the calculation for companies,"" said Dr Tim Summers, a Senior Fellow at Chatham House, based in Hong Kong.
Companies could choose to move their goods directly through ports in mainland China instead, and higher tariffs there will mean higher price tags.
""The people who are going to get hurt are businesses and consumers,"" Dr Summers said.
**Will China be worried?**
Not so much as it might have been at the time of the Hong Kong handover. Back in 1997, Hong Kong played a much more significant role in China's economy, accounting for around 18% of China's GDP.
""But over the last 25 years China has grown massively,"" said Dr Summers. Hong Kong now contributes just 2-3% of China's GDP.
""Put that in context of the ocean of trade coming out of China, it's not so significant any more. So if President Trump were to act on trade, Hong Kong would suffer, but it's not a gamechanger for China,"" he said.
Beijing will however want to maintain Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre. Mainland Chinese companies are among those which choose to list on Hong Kong's Stock Exchange because of its access to global capital. Mainland Chinese companies also benefit from Hong Kong's large financial services sector.
""Shanghai and Shenzhen already have a vibrant financial services sector serving mainlanders,"" said David Webb, a former investment banker who's lived in Hong Kong since 1991. But so long as Beijing has capital controls on the movement of money in and out of China for investment, ""then it can't compete with Hong Kong on international capital,"" he said.
**How could this affect the US?**
Each year, billions of dollars worth of goods and services are traded between Hong Kong and the US. In 2018, the total value of that trade was almost $67bn according to the US Trade Representative, including $17bn worth of imports that Americans bought from Hong Kong.
If Hong Kong faces the same trading terms as mainland China, US consumers will pay more for those goods.
""American businesses both in the US itself and in Hong Kong are lobbying hard to try and get any action diluted,"" said Rachel Cartland, director of Cartland Consulting and a former Hong Kong civil servant.
The US Chamber of Commerce has warned that far-reaching changes to Hong Kong's status would have ""serious implications"" for Hong Kong and US businesses.
That puts Washington in a tricky position, according Dr Summers.
He says ostensibly, Secretary Pompeo's threat appears to be about recent developments in Hong Kong, and Beijing's new security law for the territory. But he said, what it's really about is US-China relations.
""If I were going to be really cynical, I would say this has provided an opportunity for some people in Washington to take measures they wanted to take anyway against China, in the context of a wider US-China rivalry,"" he said.
""That may well drive the thinking of what Trump does next more than any particular concern about the political autonomy of Hong Kong,"" he said."

Lake Nyos, a volcanic crater lake located in the Northwest Region of Cameroon
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
A study of naturally occurring CO2 reservoirs has given a boost to carbon capture projects, by concluding mild acidity of CO2 / Carbonic Acid does not significantly corrode the rocks holding it in, even on 100,000 year timescales. But this study does nothing to allay my concerns about the hideous dangers I believe are associated with this technology.
The Press Release;
Carbon dioxide can be stored underground for ten times the length needed to avoid climatic impact
Study of natural-occurring 100,000 year-old CO2 reservoirs shows no significant corroding of ‘cap rock’, suggesting the greenhouse gas hasn’t leaked back out – one of the main concerns with greenhouse gas reduction proposal of carbon capture and storage.
New research shows that natural accumulations of carbon dioxide (CO2) that have been trapped underground for around 100,000 years have not significantly corroded the rocks above, suggesting that storing CO2 in reservoirs deep underground is much safer and more predictable over long periods of time than previously thought.
These findings, published today in the journal Nature Communications, demonstrate the viability of a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a solution to reducing carbon emissions from coal and gas-fired power stations, say researchers.
CCS involves capturing the carbon dioxide produced at power stations, compressing it, and pumping it into reservoirs in the rock more than a kilometre underground.
The CO2 must remain buried for at least 10,000 years to avoid the impacts on climate. One concern is that the dilute acid, formed when the stored CO2 dissolves in water present in the reservoir rocks, might corrode the rocks above and let the CO2 escape upwards.
By studying a natural reservoir in Utah, USA, where CO2 released from deeper formations has been trapped for around 100,000 years, a Cambridge-led research team has now shown that CO2 can be securely stored underground for far longer than the 10,000 years needed to avoid climatic impacts.
Their new study shows that the critical component in geological carbon storage, the relatively impermeable layer of “cap rock” that retains the CO2, can resist corrosion from CO2-saturated water for at least 100,000 years.
“Carbon capture and storage is seen as essential technology if the UK is to meet its climate change targets,” says principle investigator Professor Mike Bickle, Director of the Cambridge Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage at the University of Cambridge.
“A major obstacle to the implementation of CCS is the uncertainty over the long-term fate of the CO2 which impacts regulation, insurance, and who assumes the responsibility for maintaining CO2 storage sites. Our study demonstrates that geological carbon storage can be safe and predictable over many hundreds of thousands of years.”
The key component in the safety of geological storage of CO2 is an impermeable cap rock over the porous reservoir in which the CO2 is stored. Although the CO2 will be injected as a dense fluid, it is still less dense than the brines originally filling the pores in the reservoir sandstones, and will rise until trapped by the relatively impermeable cap rocks.
“Some earlier studies, using computer simulations and laboratory experiments, have suggested that these cap rocks might be progressively corroded by the CO2-charged brines, formed as CO2 dissolves, creating weaker and more permeable layers of rock several metres thick and jeopardising the secure retention of the CO2,” explains lead author Dr Niko Kampman.
“However, these studies were either carried out in the laboratory over short timescales or based on theoretical models. Predicting the behaviour of CO2 stored underground is best achieved by studying natural CO2 accumulations that have been retained for periods comparable to those needed for effective storage.”
To better understand these effects, this study, funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, examined a natural reservoir where large natural pockets of CO2 have been trapped in sedimentary rocks for hundreds of thousands of years. Sponsored by Shell, the team drilled deep down below the surface into one of these natural CO2 reservoirs to recover samples of the rock layers and the fluids confined in the rock pores.
The team studied the corrosion of the minerals comprising the rock by the acidic carbonated water, and how this has affected the ability of the cap rock to act as an effective trap over geological periods of time. Their analysis studied the mineralogy and geochemistry of cap rock and included bombarding samples of the rock with neutrons at a facility in Germany to better understand any changes that may have occurred in the pore structure and permeability of the cap rock.
They found that the CO2 had very little impact on corrosion of the minerals in the cap rock, with corrosion limited to a layer only 7cm thick. This is considerably less than the amount of corrosion predicted in some earlier studies, which suggested that this layer might be many metres thick.
The researchers also used computer simulations, calibrated with data collected from the rock samples, to show that this layer took at least 100,000 years to form, an age consistent with how long the site is known to have contained CO2.
The research demonstrates that the natural resistance of the cap rock minerals to the acidic carbonated waters makes burying CO2 underground a far more predictable and secure process than previously estimated.
“With careful evaluation, burying carbon dioxide underground will prove very much safer than emitting CO2 directly to the atmosphere,” says Bickle.
The Cambridge research into the CO2 reservoirs in Utah was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (CRIUS consortium of Cambridge, Manchester and Leeds universities and the British Geological Survey) and the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
The project involved an international consortium of researchers led by Cambridge, together with Aarchen University (Germany), Utrecht University (Netherlands), Utah State University (USA), the Julich Centre for Neutron Science, (Garching, Germany), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (USA), the British Geological Survey, and Shell Global Solutions International (Netherlands).

The abstract of the study;
Observational evidence confirms modelling of the long-term integrity of CO2-reservoir caprocks
Storage of anthropogenic CO2 in geological formations relies on a caprock as the primary seal preventing buoyant super-critical CO2 escaping. Although natural CO2 reservoirs demonstrate that CO2 may be stored safely for millions of years, uncertainty remains in predicting how caprocks will react with CO2-bearing brines. This uncertainty poses a significant challenge to the risk assessment of geological carbon storage. Here we describe mineral reaction fronts in a CO2 reservoir-caprock system exposed to CO2 over a timescale comparable with that needed for geological carbon storage. The propagation of the reaction front is retarded by redox-sensitive mineral dissolution reactions and carbonate precipitation, which reduces its penetration into the caprock to ~7 cm in ~105 years. This distance is an order-of-magnitude smaller than previous predictions. The results attest to the significance of transport-limited reactions to the long-term integrity of sealing behaviour in caprocks exposed to CO2.

Given that CO2 seems stable when pumped into correctly surveyed reservoirs, why am I concerned?
My concern is the sheer volume of CO2 which would have to to be buried to make a difference. It would only take one mistake, one contractor shortcut too many, to create a loss of life on a scale comparable to the deaths which would result from a large nuclear explosion in a populated area.
Consider the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster, which occurred when a “natural” source of CO2 suddenly burped – thankfully in a sparsely populated area.
Although a sudden outgassing of CO2 had occurred at Lake Monoun in 1984, a similar threat from Lake Nyos was not anticipated.
Cattle suffocated by carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos
On August 21, 1986, a limnic eruption occurred at Lake Nyos, triggering the sudden release of about 100,000–300,000 tons (some sources state as much as 1.6 million tons) of CO2. This gas cloud rose at nearly 100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) and spilled over the northern lip of the lake into a valley running roughly east-west from Cha to Subum. It then rushed down two valleys branching off to the north, displacing all of the air and suffocating some 1,700 people within 25 kilometres (16 mi) of the lake, mostly rural villagers, as well as 3,500 livestock. The villages most affected were Cha, Nyos, and Subum. Scientists concluded from evidence that a 100 m (330 ft) fountain of water and foam formed at the surface of the lake. The huge amount of water rising suddenly caused much turbulence in the water, spawning a wave of at least 25 metres (82 ft) that would scour the shore of one side.
One survivor, Joseph Nkwain from Subum, described himself when he awoke after the gases had struck:
“I could not speak. I became unconscious. I could not open my mouth because then I smelled something terrible . . . I heard my daughter snoring in a terrible way, very abnormal . . . When crossing to my daughter’s bed . . . I collapsed and fell. I was there till nine o’clock in the (Friday) morning . . . until a friend of mine came and knocked at my door . . . I was surprised to see that my trousers were red, had some stains like honey. I saw some . . . starchy mess on my body. My arms had some wounds . . . I didn’t really know how I got these wounds . . . I opened the door . . . I wanted to speak, my breath would not come out . . . My daughter was already dead . . . I went into my daughter’s bed, thinking that she was still sleeping. I slept till it was 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon . . . on Friday. (Then) I managed to go over to my neighbors’ houses. They were all dead . . . I decided to leave . . . (because) most of my family was in Wum . . . I got my motorcycle . . . A friend whose father had died left with me (for) Wum . . . As I rode . . . through Nyos I didn’t see any sign of any living thing . . . (When I got to Wum), I was unable to walk, even to talk . . . my body was completely weak.”
Carbon dioxide, being about 1.5 times as dense as air, caused the cloud to “hug” the ground and descend down the valleys, where various villages were located. The mass was about 50 metres (160 ft) thick and it travelled downward at a rate of 20–50 kilometres per hour (12–31 mph). For roughly 23 kilometres (14 mi) the cloud remained condensed and dangerous, suffocating many of the people sleeping in Nyos, Kam, Cha, and Sebum. About 4,000 inhabitants fled the area, and many of these developed respiratory problems, lesions, and paralysis as a result of the gases.
It is not known what triggered the catastrophic outgassing. Most geologists suspect a landslide, but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake. A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn. Others still believe there was a small earthquake, but as witnesses did not report feeling any tremors on the morning of the disaster, this hypothesis is unlikely. Whatever the cause, the event resulted in the rapid mixing of the supersaturated deep water with the upper layers of the lake, where the reduced pressure allowed the stored CO2 to effervesce out of solution.[citation needed]
It is believed that about 1.2 cubic kilometres (0.29 cu mi) of gas was released.[16] The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing, due to iron-rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being oxidised by the air. The level of the lake dropped by about a metre and trees near the lake were knocked down.

The 1-300,000 tons of CO2 which was released from Lake Nyos is about the amount of CO2 produced by one medium coal power station over 6 months or so of normal operation. According to the US EPA, America produces around 5000,000,000 tons of CO2 every year.
One slip-up, one corrupt contractor, one mistake which led to the abrupt release of 0.006% of the CO2 which would have to be captured and buried to make America “carbon neutral”, could kill millions of people, if it occurred near a major population centre.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowdown: The braked warming of the last one and a half decades and its reasons
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning und Prof. Fritz Vahrenhholt
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
Stefan Rahmstorf is against the notion of a warming hiatus. In his eyes it doesn’t exist. Instead he prefers to live in his Rahmstorfian world, where every thing is the way it’s supposed to be: warming is galloping along. It’s a strange parallel world that has nothing to do with reality.
The rest of the scientific community, fortunately, see things somewhat more realistically and are busily publishing papers on the reasons for the hiatus or slowdown. The Institute for Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has even issued a press release on the subject:
New Study Reveals the Atmospheric Footprint of the Global Warming Hiatus
The increasing rate of the global mean surface temperature was reduced from 1998 to 2013, known as the global warming hiatus or pause. Great efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the cause. The proposed mechanisms include the internal variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, the ocean heat uptake and redistribution, among many others. However, the atmospheric footprint of the recent warming hiatus has been less concerned. Both the dynamical and physical processes remain unclear.
In a recent paper published in Scientific Report, LIU Bo and ZHOU Tianjun from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences have investigated the atmospheric anomalous features during the global warming hiatus period (1998-2013). They show evidences that the global mean tropospheric temperature also experienced a hiatus or pause (Fig. 1). To understand the physical processes that dominate the warming hiatus, they decomposed the total temperature trends into components due to processes related to surface albedo, water vapor, cloud, surface turbulent fluxes and atmospheric dynamics. The results demonstrated that the hiatus of near surface temperature warming trend is dominated by the decreasing surface latent heat flux compared with the preceding warming period, while the hiatus of upper tropospheric temperature is dominated by the cloud-related processes. Further analysis indicated that atmospheric dynamics are coupled with surface turbulent heat fluxes over lower troposphere and coupled with cloud processes over upper troposphere.

Figure 1. (a) Global mean temperature anomalies from 1950 to 2015 and (b) linear trends of global mean temperature for near surface (i.e. the lowest atmospheric layer), and the vertical average of the whole (surface to 100hPa), lower (surface to 500hPa), and upper troposphere (500hPa to 100hPa). Red (black) bars are for the warming period. Blue(white) bars are for the hiatus period. (Liu and Zhou, 2017)
As to why the surface latent heat flux, atmospheric dynamics and cloud-related processes showed such large differences between 1983-1998 and 1998-2013, LIU, the first author of the paper, explained, “They are dominated by the Hadley Circulation and Walker Circulation changes associated with the phase transition of Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO).” According to LIU, the IPO is a robust, recurring pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies at decadal time scale. During a positive phase of IPO, the west Pacific and the mid-latitude North Pacific becomes cooler and the tropical eastern ocean warms, while during a negative phase, the opposite pattern occurs. The IPO has shifted from the positive phase to negative phase since 1998/1999, and this transition has led to the weakening of both Hadley Circulation and Walker Circulation, which served as a hub linking the three processes mentioned above.
 “Though the heat capacity of the atmosphere is nearly negligible compared with the ocean”, said ZHOU, the corresponding author of the paper, “understanding the atmospheric footprint is essential to gain a full picture of how internal climate variability such as IPO affects the global climate from the surface to the troposphere. The new findings also provide useful observational metrics for gauging climate model experiments that are designed to understand the mechanism of global warming hiatus”.

In other words: The hiatus was triggered by ocean cycles. This by the way was already discussed in 2012 in our book “Die kalte Sonne” (The Neglected Sun). Perhaps this message will eventually reach Potsdam.
Then on 15 April 2017 yet another paper appeared on the subject. Oka and Watanabe explained in the Geophysical Research Letters how the braked warming had to do with ocean cycles in the Pacific:
The post-2002 global surface warming slowdown caused by the subtropical Southern Ocean heating acceleration
The warming rate of global mean surface temperature slowed down during 1998–2012. Previous studies pointed out role of increasing ocean heat uptake during this global warming slowdown, but its mechanism remains under discussion. Our numerical simulations, in which wind stress anomaly in the equatorial Pacific is imposed from reanalysis data, suggest that subsurface warming in the equatorial Pacific took place during initial phase of the global warming slowdown (1998–2002), as previously reported. It is newly clarified that the Ekman transport from tropics to subtropics is enhanced during the later phase of the slowdown (after 2002) and enhanced subtropical Ekman downwelling causes accelerated heat storage below depth of 700 m in the subtropical Southern Ocean, leading to the post-2002 global warming slowdown. Observational data of ocean temperature also support this scenario. This study provides clear evidence that deeper parts of the Southern Ocean play a critical role in the post-2002 warming slowdown.”

Every year, as the holidays approach, global warming hype goes ballistic. This is when the United Nations holds its annual international climate summit, known as “The Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change”, usually (but not always) in some warm place that requires tankers full of jet‐​A fuel to reach.



My activist‐​scientist friends don’t want to go back to flying in coach, nor do the “Non Governmental Organizations”, like Greenpeace and their ilk. So this is also the season when stories of death, destruction, and the end of the world from climate change appear daily. Tens of news items on Google are just a click away.



As a quintessential science example, federal climatologist Ben Santer just published a pal‐​reviewed paper in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ loudly proclaiming that the dreaded man‐​made global warming signal has emerged from our naturally chaotic climate.



That’s pretty much what he wrote in _Nature_ for the UN’s 1996 edition of this conference, 16 years ago. If at first you don’t succeed…



Speaking of incessant repetition, U.N. Secretary‐​General Ban‐​Ki Moon continues to conflate post‐​tropical cyclone Sandy with global warming. I guess he thinks that’s going to make the U.S. shell out the lion’s share of a $100 billion‐​per‐​year honeypot that is being demanded by third‐​world despots, another feature of the U.N’s annual climatefests.



Although everyone at the Doha conference can’t get enough of poor Sandy, the arguments linking her impressive damages to climate change are less than compelling.



Stories that sea levels have risen dramatically around New York City because of global warming are a bit of a stretch. The continuous record of water level at Battery Park shows a pretty steady rise of about 17 inches since 1856. About half of this was caused by the fact that the land is sinking (as shown in 2009 by S.E. Englehart in _Geology_ ). The post‐​1850 escape from the Little Ice Age of the 17th and 18th centuries is probably good for about a third of the remainder. That leaves a maximum six or seven inches of sea level rise remaining from human‐​induced warming (probably less), which is pretty small beer.



So, of the 17.34 foot record elevation of the station base sea level caused by Sandy, yes, a maximum of about six inches might be related to human activity. Obviously, if there were no Homo sapiens, Sandy would have caused pretty much the same overwash, with or without warmer seas.



Then there’s the notion that global warming pulled Sandy to the west, striking New Jersey, instead of harmlessly recurving northeastward off of Cape Cod. While this was a very popular meme on TV and is no doubt on the lips of all in Doha, it’s actually a testable hypothesis.



According to a recent paper by Francis and Vavrus in _Geophysical Research Letters_ , the preferential warming of the Arctic, with a concomitant decline in late‐​summer sea ice, results in a more meandering jet stream, which is why Sandy shifted westward, rather than being shoved out to sea by the normally strong westerlies associated with the jet.



Satellite data show that arctic late‐​summer ice has been in decline for about 25 years. The Francis and Vavrus hypothesis predicts that hurricanes will be increasingly deflected westward after they pass Cape Hatteras, instead of taking their usually benign easterly track.



Well, as the Late Casey Stengel would say, “you could look it up”. Since 1900, there have been about a dozen (give‐​or‐​take one or two because some tracks are a bit ambiguous) that have made landfall in the U.S. north of Hatteras, having acquired a westerly motion component. Some were very destructive, including the 1938 Long Island Express, which would have made Sandy look like a toddler had it made landfall 100 miles farther west. 1972’s tropical storm Agnes—which shared a lot of meteorological characteristics with Sandy—produced what is still the flood of record for much of the Northeast.



The last such system was tropical storm Danielle, over twenty years ago. The time between Danielle and Sandy was the longest interval in the record between westward‐​moving storms north of Hatteras.



So much for that hypothesis. But facts—climatological or familiar—tend not to matter in the holiday season, when climate hype is as common as fruitcake, as our friends in the United Nations party on.

Storm Brewing, Port Lincoln South Australia, 2013. By Jacqui Barker [CC BY 2.0], via Wikimedia CommonsGuest essay by Eric Worrall
A study led by ANU Professor Neville Abram, which claims climate is driving clouds south, resulting in less rain reaching Australia’s Southern Coast, has been published in the midst of massive flooding in South Australia. Greens of course blame climate change for the deluge.
The press release;
Australia’s west, south losing vital rain as climate change shifts winds, study finds
Rising greenhouse gases and ozone depletion over the Antarctic are increasingly pushing rain-bearing storm fronts away from Australia’s west and south, according to a new international study.
The research, which involved the Australian National University and 16 other institutions from around the world, has just been published in the Nature Climate Change journal.
It found Southern Ocean westerly winds and associated storms were shifting south, down towards Antarctica, and robbing southern parts of Australia of rain.
ANU Associate Professor Nerilie Abram, the lead Australian researcher, said this had contributed to a decline of more than 20 per cent in winter rainfall in southwestern Australia since the 1970s.
“That band of rainfall that comes in those westerly winds is shifting further south, so closer towards Antarctica,” Dr Abram, from the ANU’s Research School of Earth Sciences and ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, said.

The abstract of the study is rather opaque, and unfortunately the main study is paywalled. Interestingly the study seems to suggest natural variability may have been underestimated, which seems at odds with Professor Abram’s press statements.
Assessing recent trends in high-latitude Southern Hemisphere surface climate
Understanding the causes of recent climatic trends and variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere is hampered by a short instrumental record. Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.

So what about that flooding? As WUWT recently reported, South Australia is currently experiencing severe flooding and rainfall, and a statewide power blackout, thanks to their dependency on unreliable renewables backed by high voltage interconnectors from other states – above ground interconnector lines which are vulnerable to extreme weather. Greens of course are blaming climate for the intense storm.
Climate change is driving storms like South Australia’s
The storm which has ravaged South Australia is a disturbing preview of what’s likely to come if Australia fails to act on climate change.
Storms like the one which knocked out the entire South Australian electricity network yesterday are occurring in a warmer and wetter atmosphere, the Climate Council’s Professor Will Steffen said.
“These conditions, driven by climate change, are likely increasing the intensity of storms like the one in South Australia,” he said.
…
Read more: https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/climate-change-to-blame-for-south-australias-storm
I suggest that the only conclusion we can draw from statements by Tim Flannery’s climate council, and the Abram study published in Nature, is that magic CO2 molecule is both driving both an intensification of storms, and it is also driving storms away from the southern coast of Australia.

In our all-too-politically-correct world, carbon dioxide (CO2) frequently gets a bad rap, demonized for its _potential_ and _unverified_ effects on climate. However, if the truth be told, carbon dioxide is a magnificent molecule, essential to nearly all life on Earth. It is the primary raw material from which plants construct their tissues and grow during the process of photosynthesis. Perhaps it should come as no surprise, therefore, that plants perform this essential function ever better as atmospheric CO2 levels climb ever higher, a fact demonstrated in literally _thousands_ of laboratory and field studies (see, for example, the Plant Growth Database of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change). And because plants are the ultimate food source for animals and humans, we are all indebted to CO2 for its role in sustaining and promoting the growth of plants everywhere.   
  
But there are _other_ benefits to atmospheric CO2 enrichment beyond enhancing plant growth, as illustrated in the recent study of Xi _et al_. (2014). Publishing in the professional journal _Food Chemistry_ , the six-member team of Chinese horticultural and food scientists “investigated the effectiveness of CO2 enrichment for improving fruit flavor and customer acceptance of greenhouse-grown peaches.”   
  
The rationale for their study stems from the fact that peaches are widely cultivated in greenhouses throughout northern China. Under such controlled conditions, the trees are afforded protection from the natural environment, including damaging low temperatures and high winds. But this protection does not come without a price—plant photosynthesis can cause CO2 levels inside closed greenhouses to decrease during daylight hours to values below 200 parts per million, which values are _half or less than half_ the CO2 concentration of normal outside air. As a result, Xi _et al_. state these “low CO2 levels may be a limiting factor for the productivity of fruit trees cultivated in greenhouses,” and they may negatively impact the “development of fruit flavor quality” and aroma, which is not good for those in the peach growing business! Thus, the six scientists set out to explore how enriching greenhouse air with CO2 might mitigate these potential problems.   
  
For their experimental design, Xi _et al_. (2014) divided a greenhouse into two parts using a hermetic barrier wall, supplying one side with CO2-enriched air and the other with ambient air to be used as the control. The enriched side of the greenhouse was maintained at an atmospheric CO2 value of 360 ppm (approximately twice that of the control) from 12:00 to 16:00 each day during the main CO2 shortage period, while “fruit sugar, organic acids, volatile contents and consumer acceptability were investigated, focusing on the period of postharvest ripening.”   
  
With respect to their findings, the Chinese researchers report that net photosynthesis was significantly increased in the trees growing in the CO2-enchanced portion of the greenhouse despite their receiving only a mere 4 hours of CO2 enrichment per day above those growing in the ambient or control portion of the structure. Elevated CO2 also improved fruit flavor and aroma, significantly increasing dominant sugar levels (sucrose and fructose), fruity aroma compounds (lactones), and floral scent compounds (norisoprenoids), while decreasing compounds that contribute to fruit sourness and undesirable aroma volatiles (Table 1).   
  
**_Table1_** _. Percent difference of various peach fruit compounds from trees grown in CO 2 enriched air, relative to trees grown in ambient air, as measured in fruit picked on the day of harvest and five days after harvest. Data derived from Table 1 of Xi et al. (2014)._

_



  
  
As a result of their findings, the authors conclude that “CO2 enrichment can significantly improve the flavor quality of ‘Zaolupantao’ peach fruits grown in greenhouse and their consumer acceptance.” And if it can do that from a mere four hours of CO2 enrichment per day in a greenhouse, imagine what _24 hours_ of enrichment might promise for other fruiting plants growing out-of-doors, in natural environments, under present-day global atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 400 ppm and above? Hinting at the possibilities, Xi _et al_. cite the work of researchers studying other fruits, where similar CO2 benefits have been reported for tomato (Shahidul Islam _et al_., 1996; Zhang _et al_., 2014), strawberry (Wang and Bunce, 2004; Sun _et al_., 2012), and grapes (Bindi _et al_., 2001).   
  
Yes, truth be told, atmospheric CO2 is a _magnificent_ molecule, and those who continue to _demonize it_ based on potential and unproven climatic effects, should _wake up and smell the peaches_ —or they should at least _eat_ one and taste how sweet its biological benefits can be!

This is getting repetitious. Once again, the United States stands alone against a United Nations determined to impose its view of disastrous climate change. And, once again, the U.N. threatens economic annihilation if we don’t go along. They call America’s action “Unilateralism.” But let’s call it by its real name: “common sense.”



This time it concerns the insurance industry. On Oct. 7‐​not coincidentally just a few days after the American hurricane season reaches its peak‐​the U.N.‘s Climate Change Working Group released a report called “Climate Change and the Financial Services Industry.” The predictable bottom line: Climate Change has the potential to destroy the insurance industry, so, America, please get in line with our view of climate change. 



This kind of stuff comes from the top. U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan keeps criticizing our reluctance to adopt the scientifically discredited Kyoto Protocol. In a recent op‐​ed in the Washington Post that was his number one demand. 



But the U.N.‘s new report goes Annan one further. While finally admitting that Kyoto won’t do much about the planet’s climate, the report then demands more and more and more Kyotos, in agreement with scientists in the Clinton administration who estimated that we need about 19 Kyotos to stop warming. One Kyoto costs, conservatively, 2 percent of our GDP per year. Nineteen? Don’t go there, unless you’re the U.N.



Specifically, the new U.N. report projects that, as a result of climate change leading to more frequent and severe storms, along with demographic changes (read: more people able to afford more expensive beach houses) worldwide insurance losses will total an additional $150 billion in the next decade. They trot out an impressive graph showing dramatic increases in damage costs in recent years. 



What isn’t apparent, except to anyone reading the fine print, is that this figure lists damages from all “natural causes,” and that most of the recent increase is from two big earthquakes (1994 and 1995). While our greener friends like to blame many oddities on global warming, no one is crazy enough to say that it causes earthquakes.



Big European reinsurers (the people who insure the insurance companies), like Swiss Re and Munich Re, have been singing the climate change dirge for years. It forms a convincing argument for raising their rates, and their pro‐​Kyoto (read: anti U.S.) governments are only too happy to nod in agreement. 



By far, the biggest producer of weather‐​related damage is the hurricane, and the largest exposure, in terms of insured property value, is the United States east coast, where the insured value is roughly the same as our annual gross domestic product. Further, damage costs appear to be going up. So, if the U.N. is right, the number or severity of hurricanes should be increasing dramatically.



It’s not. There’s no trend at all in the number of these storms striking the United States. In fact, the 1990s appear to be especially hurricane‐​poor. It’s also well known to hurricane scientists that the average maximum recorded winds have been declining for the last half‐​century. 



The new U.N. document is so brazen that it contravenes another U.N. body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In its latest compendium on the subject, called the “Third Assessment Report,” which it likes to call the “consensus of scientists” (it’s really the “consensus of scientists picked by the U.N.”), says:



“There is little sign of long‐​term changes in tropical storm intensity and frequency,” and “[r]ecent analyses of changes in severe local weather (tornadoes, thunder days, lightning and hail) in a few selected regions provide no compelling evidence for widespread systematic long‐​term changes.” 



As for the future, the U.N. climate report says that its climate models show no systematic changes in these storms. 



While Munich Re, Swiss Re, and the U.N. Climate Change Working Group shill for a mutually interested, if falsified, climate apocalypse, who isn’t surprised that Americans have a different idea?



Let’s guess that there really is a free market here, and that U.S. insurers can choose between Munich Re, with rates artificially kited by fears of worsening climate, and some American reinsurer, whose rates are predicated on constant climate with increasing property values. Munich Re would advertise its product as more reliable, with assurance that it can survive our increasingly harsh climate. The Americans will be much less expensive. Given the facts, which would you choose?



Let’s predict that global warming hype isn’t going to put American reinsurers out of business, but that it could be very harmful to the economic well‐​being of their European competitors. Hurray for American “Unilateralism.”

"Lakes of the Hudson Bay Lowlands, in northeast Canada, are showing evidence of abrupt change in one of the last Arctic regions of the world to have experienced global warming, according to Canadian research published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal. The research team consisting of Drs Kathleen Rühland, John Smol, and Neal Michelutti from Queen’s University Ontario, Dr Andrew Paterson of Ontario’s Ministry of the Environment, and Bill Keller from the Laurentian University Ontario, retrieved sediment cores from lakes around the western shoreline of Hudson Bay and looked for changes in the microscopic algae that settle at the lake bottom after death. These algae, known as diatoms, are at the base of the food chain and are an important component of lake ecosystems. When they die and fall to the lake bed they leave behind an environmental archive in the sediment layers that continually accumulate year after year. By examining the changes through time, researchers can trace the environmental history of the region. The Hudson Bay Lowlands were one of the last holdouts against the trend of global warming in the Arctic, but has in a very short period succumbed. In contrast to most of the Arctic, the lowlands maintained relatively stable temperatures until at least the mid-1990s. The region has been an Arctic refugium from warming due to the persistence of sea ice on Hudson Bay, the largest northern inland sea, that provides natural cooling. Previous paleolimnological work (the study of lake histories) in the region found that the biological communities of lakes around Hudson Bay had remained stable for hundreds of years – unlike the dramatic shifts in aquatic biota that were observed throughout most of the Arctic in response to warming. But in only a couple of decades, air temperatures in the region have increased at a pace and magnitude that are exceptional – even by Arctic standards. Recent studies by climate researchers on Hudson Bay have been reporting reductions in sea ice that have seen the open-water period lengthen by about three weeks compared to the 1990s. The melting sea ice has accelerated the warming trend of the region, quickly creating a positive feedback response that has increased the warming yet further. We found that, for the first time in over 200 years, the lakes are showing signs of climate change. The diatom records showed relatively stable and simple assemblages consisting of benthic (bottom dwelling) species throughout the record until the last two decades. At that point there was a distinct shift to more diverse assemblages that now include open water diatoms. These diatom changes are very similar to those we have found in lakes and ponds throughout circumpolar regions in response to rising air temperatures and less ice. But despite arriving much later in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, the speed and magnitude of the warming taking place here is extraordinary. The response of freshwater ecosystems to this very rapid and pronounced warming carries many implications for the future of this Arctic ecosystem. It is home to the world’s southern-most population of polar bears, who depend upon permafrost and on sea ice on the bay for survival. In just two decades the response to warming can be detected at both ends of the food chain, among primary producers at the bottom and polar bears at the top. The effects are felt even among humans, with extreme and unpredictable weather conditions now commonplace in the region making it more difficult for First Nations people follow their traditional fishing and hunting routes. Our findings suggest that ecological tipping points have been crossed and that, sadly, we are witnessing the loss of Arctic ecosystems as we know them. The Hudson Bay Lowlands are the southern-most Arctic region in the world, and therefore on the front lines of rising temperatures. One of the world’s largest peatland areas, the lowlands are a significant reservoir of the world’s carbon. If global warming were to increase the release of that carbon into the atmosphere, the repercussions would be of world-wide importance."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother new study dampens climate alarm even more: “Summary of “Simple model for the anthropogenically forced CO2 cycle tested on measured quantities“.
A new paper by Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and Carl Otto Weiss appearing in the Journal of Geography, Environment and Earth Science International has found: “the increase of atmospheric CO2 will gradually come to an end” and that the “the ocean as well as the biosphere will be the primary sinks of future CO2 emissions of mankind“.
Try as hard as mankind may, but according to the results of this paper we may in fact never even succeed in doubling the pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentration.
The authors found that a maximum of 500-800 ppm will be reached. Today we are at just over 400 ppm. What follows is the abstract:
The carbon dioxide information analysis center (CDIAC) provides a remarkable 163 years of data on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, man-made CO2 emissions, and from 1959 onwards CO2 net-fluxes into oceans and biosphere. Currently, half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere. Predominantly the ocean and the biosphere absorb the second half in about equal parts. We describe the anthropogenically forced CO2 dynamics by a linear model of only two parameters which represent physics and biological laws. Our model reproduces the CDIAC measurements perfectly, and allows thus predictions for the future. It does not deal with the equilibrium exchanges of CO2 between atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, but treats merely the net-fluxes resulting from the perturbation of the equilibrium by the anthropogenic emissions. Details as yielded by tracer measurements or ocean chemistry are not required. We applied the model for a tentative projection of the future CO2 cycle based on prospective anthropogenic emission scenarios from the literature. As a result, the increase of atmospheric CO2 will gradually come to an end and the ocean as well as the biosphere will be the primary sinks of future CO2 emissions of mankind.
The authors devised a model that describes the net flows of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere, the oceans and the biosphere.

Integration yields the CO2 amounts taken up by these sinks. Since the CO2 content of the oceans is more than 40 times larger than that of the atmosphere, the flow into the oceans can be described by the linear mass action law. This flow is proportional to the difference of partial CO2 pressures in oceans and atmosphere with a proportionality factor. While the CO2 partial pressure in the atmosphere changes, the CO2 partial pressure of the ocean remains practically constant.
The CO2 flow from atmosphere to biosphere can equally be described linearly. It is assumed to be proportional to the CO2 flow into the atmosphere. This assumption is plausible since increased concentration of CO2 results in linearly increased plant growth.
As the authors state in the abstract, their model reproduces the CDIAC measurements perfectly, and thus allows predictions for the future. The authors summarize that assuming the strongest human emission scenario of burning all global carbon resources the main result concerning the future CO2 content of the atmosphere is that it cannot exceed about 800 ppm.
They conclude:
With regard to the actual discussion about an assumed dangerous climate change by anthropogenic CO2 emissions in future, our most important model result yields the impact of anthropogenic CO2 emission scenarios given in [20] until the year 2100 AD (completed by own tentative continuations from 2100 to 2150AD). For all scenarios, between 2080 to 2140 AD atmospheric CO2 concentrations up to at most 500 until 800 ppm occur. These future turning points of the atmospheric CO2 content take place 30 years after the pertinent emissions maxima. The maximum of 800 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration seems to be safe because the pertinent emission scenario assumes burning a twofold of the actual known coal reserves worldwide. After the apogee of atmospheric CO2 concentration predominantly the ocean and the biosphere will be the sinks of future CO2 emissions of mankind.

"On a clear day one can see North Somerset – the future site of Britain’s Hinkley Point C new nuclear power station – from Cardiff Bay, across the Severn Estuary. Deep in hilly Powys, arguments rage around where wind turbines should be located (or if they should be built at all). And although plans for the 11-mile, hydro-electric Severn Barrage have once again been kicked into the long grass, few would bet against this hardy proposal rising again. Wales faces critical decisions, as does the rest of the UK, about how to meet its future energy needs. An energy generation network that is cleaner and more resilient to shocks is slowly becoming a reality. But the question remains as to exactly what the future will hold. Rising household energy bills threaten the living standards of many families. Public anger at the “Big Six” energy companies and the government’s claims to be powerless to prevent further price hikes is growing. Fuel poverty – the choice between heating and eating – is a harsh reality for many. So it is against this tense backdrop that public views about the energy system are formed and negotiated. Studies show that people are very positive towards renewable technologies like wind, wave and solar, dubious about the health and environmental impacts of fossil fuels like coal and gas, and in two minds about the “devil’s bargain” of nuclear power. This picture changes a little on moving from the national perspective to a local one. Here specific developments are likely to be strongly challenged and contested, whether they are wind turbines, or fracking gas and oil wells. People are often accused of adopting a “not in my backyard” – nimby attitude – but research has revealed a more complex picture. People’s views about energy are comprised of more than a kneejerk yes or no answer. Often, it is the lack of public involvement at the early stages of discussion about where to site new energy infrastructure that is at the heart of opposition. So although there are some firm opponents of wind farms (as well as many enthusiastic supporters), politicians and planners should expect controversy over “fracking” to be just as heated. Recent research, conducted over four years at Cardiff University with thousands of members of the public, has produced the most comprehensive view of the public’s view of energy. The study found that although opinions on different energy technologies vary for a number of reasons, there are some core values that underpin these judgements. Whether it is wind farms or nuclear power, the public make up their minds on energy technologies according to a set of underlying principles that include fairness, avoiding wastefulness and affordability. If a technology is seen as reflecting these values, it is likely to be approved of. If it seems to violate them, it will be viewed less favourably. An important conclusion of the study was that the British public wants and expects change from the energy system - and that if change is going to happen, we have the opportunity to do it right. Although the cost of energy bills was a key consideration, people also considered that affordability was about paying a fair price, and balancing today’s needs with investing in the future. The study’s key insight, though, is that it is people’s values, more than the facts and figures constantly thrown back and forth about energy, which play the biggest role in shaping perceptions of energy and climate change. This conclusion is an important reminder that tackling climate change is at heart a human challenge, not only a technological one. How we produce and consume energy will change one way or another: ageing power stations must be replaced, and the need to move towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy system will guide these changes. But exactly what shape energy future will take is something in which we all have a stake – and so it’s a debate in which as many people as possible should be involved. Dr Adam Corner speaks at the free talk, “Mind the gap: meeting the UK energy challenge”, at Cardiff University on November 6."

Oh this is funny. I pointed out the other day on Twitter that “Global Warming is the universal boogeyman of the left”. Almost anything that seems slightly out of the ordinary in the natural world now seems to have global warming or climate change immediately slapped on it as the cause. I blame the education system and the lack of teaching critical thinking. One of the most famous knee jerk reactions aided and abetted by a graph that should have had a caveat from the “correlation is not causation” department comes from the Washington Post environmental reporter Jason Samenow:

His article: D.C.’s cherry blossoms have shifted 5 days earlier: what about global warming and the future? immediately puts warming as the blame, excluding any other possibility, because, see there’s this graph he made, and the evidence is right there:
My analysis of temperatures and blooms dates reveals Washington’s average March temperature has warmed 2.3 degrees in the last 90 years and that the cherry blossom peak bloom date has shifted a little more than 5 days earlier (based on simple linear regression).
In other words, real-world data support the overall idea that the D.C.’s March climate is warming and the blossoms’ bloom dates are shifting earlier in response.
He didn’t even consider any other possibility, he assumed warming was the cause from the start, set out to prove it while excluding all other possibilities, and then bolstered his preformed conclusion with “real world data”. Problem is, that’s not science, it’s activism. Dr. Richard Feynman once wrote:
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.
That’s what happened to Jason Samenow – he fooled himself, and in the process of publishing that article, fooled others.
But he didn’t look at other factors that affect trees and tree growth, he didn’t pay attention to Liebig’s Law of the Minimum. He’s in good company, neither did Dr. Michael Mann when he assumed that trees were only responding to temperature and nothing else.
Liebig’s Law applies to plant growth and can be summed up as this:
“The availability of the most abundant nutrient in the soil is only as good as the availability of the least abundant nutrient in the soil.” Or, to put it more plainly, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.”
For example, the growth of an organism such as a plant may be dependent on a number of factors, such as sunlight or mineral nutrients (e.g. nitrate orphosphate). The availability of these may vary, such that at any given time one is more limiting than the others. Liebig’s Law states that growth only occurs at the rate permitted by the most limiting. – Wikipedia
In the case of plants and trees, the most important basic factors in growth are:

Water
Soil nutrients
Available sunlight
Temperature

There are others, but these suffice for the point being made. We can assume that because the Washington cherry trees are curated and budding times tracked by the National Park Service that they get plenty of water and nutrients, after all we can’t have dead and dying cherry trees on the mall. That would insult Japan, who made them a gift in 1912 before they decided to surprise bomb the crap out of us at Pearl Harbor.
So we can assume water and nutrients are relatively stable in Washington where the cherry trees are – that leaves temperature and available sunlight. Samenow points out that the average temperature in Washington D.C. has gone up, citing this paper: Predicting the Timing of Cherry Blossoms in Washington, DC and Mid-Atlantic States in Response to Climate Change
That temperatures have risen in Washington D.C. is no surprise, but I argue that it is a factor of the city growth and increased local heatsinks retaining heat at night rather than global warming. For example, look at what happened in Las Vegas, another city that has grown dramatically since the 1950’s. Minimum temperatures went up, but daytime maximum temperatures have been flat.
This study just published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B says temperature alone can’t be the cause, light pollution is a major factor too, since trees also respond to increased light, be it sunlight or light pollution from a growing and glowing city. This article in Engineering and Technology Magazine summ it up well (h/t to Peter Michael Ward on Twitter).
Research by a team from the University of Exeter and independent environmental consultants Spalding Associates has combined air pollution data from satellite images with information from the public about budding trees. The comparison revealed that in areas with the highest levels of night-time light exposure, citizen scientists reported spotting emerging leaves on trees up to 7.5 days earlier.
The team focused on larger trees such as oak, ash, beech and sycamore. However, they stressed the effects would most likely be seen across the fauna and flora of affected areas.
“Our finding that the timing of bud burst of woodland tree species may be affected by light pollution suggests that smaller plants growing below the height of street lights are even more likely to be affected,” said Professor Richard Ffrench-Constant of the University of Exeter’s department of Biosciences.
…the advance in budburst across all sites is too large to be explained by increases in temperature alone.
Up to 7.5 days earlier? Gosh, that’s even worse than Samenow’s story claiming 5 days. Better yet, this data was collected by citizen scientists, according to the press release. I’ll bet some of them might even be climate skeptics.

Behavioural ecologist Peter McGregor, of the Centre for Applied Zoology at Cornwall College Newquay, said: “This study also shows that we can use citizen science in a meaningful way and that it has a real role to play in research that can have a meaningful impact.”

Have a look at the USA’s light pollution, I’ve marked Las Vegas and Washington DC for comparison:
NASA image acquired April 18 – October 23, 2012This image of the United States of America at night is a composite assembled from data acquired by the Suomi NPP satellite in April and October 2012. The image was made possible by the new satellite’s “day-night band” of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights, gas flares, auroras, wildfires, and reflected moonlight.

Washington D.C. is even larger than Las Vegas, so it would seem not only would have it have similar increases in night-time temperature, but night-time light as well. This image from a 2001 paper is instructive:

Gosh, global night brightening  seems to be growing faster than global warming. And in Washington, those cherry trees sure seem to get a lot of light at night as this photo demonstrates:

Abstract
The ecological impact of night-time lighting is of concern because of its well-demonstrated effects on animal behaviour. However, the potential of light pollution to change plant phenology and its corresponding knock-on effects on associated herbivores are less clear. Here, we test if artificial lighting can advance the timing of budburst in trees. We took a UK-wide 13 year dataset of spatially referenced budburst data from four deciduous tree species and matched it with both satellite imagery of night-time lighting and average spring temperature. We find that budburst occurs up to 7.5 days earlier in brighter areas, with the relationship being more pronounced for later-budding species. Excluding large urban areas from the analysis showed an even more pronounced advance of budburst, confirming that the urban ‘heat-island’ effect is not the sole cause of earlier urban budburst. Similarly, the advance in budburst across all sites is too large to be explained by increases in temperature alone. This dramatic advance of budburst illustrates the need for further experimental investigation into the impact of artificial night-time lighting on plant phenology and subsequent species interactions. As light pollution is a growing global phenomenon, the findings of this study are likely to be applicable to a wide range of species interactions across the world.

Discussion
The results highlight, for the first time, to our knowledge, and at a national scale, a relationship between the amount of artificial night-time light and the date of budburst in deciduous trees. This relationship is unlikely to be caused by the UHI effect, as it is robust to the exclusion of large urban areas where temperatures are known to be elevated. Similarly, this effect is unlikely to be related to an increase in temperature alone; the maximum magnitude of effect size predicted between the brightest and darkest sites (7.5 days) is roughly equivalent to that predicted due to 2°C. Specifically, it has already been shown that urban areas are both brighter (DMSP data have been used as a proxy measure of urban extent [29,30]) and warmer (UHI effect [32]) but this is, to our knowledge, the first study explicitly investigating the relationship between the amount of night-time light and budburst while controlling for the temperature increases within urban areas. In summary, similar predictions were obtained from a model fitted to budburst data points found outside of large urban areas suggesting that it is night-time lighting causing the advance in budburst as opposed to other factors which can vary owing to urbanization, such as temperature, humidity, water availability and chemical pollution levels [38–41]. In addition, for trees experiencing average spring temperatures of 4°C, the model predicts that budburst will be advanced by up to 7.5 days in the brightest areas compared to the darkest areas.
The exposure of plants to artificial light at night is highly heterogeneous at a fine scale. Skyglow, diffuse light scattered in the atmosphere from city lights, can illuminate areas of many square kilometres to levels exceeding moonlight, but effects of artificial light on phenology have to date only been recorded as a consequence of direct illumination in the vicinity of light sources, which can be several orders of magnitude brighter [13]. As the spatial data for this study was aggregated to 5 km resolution, and the DMSP data have no direct calibration, the DMSP value for each pixel cannot be easily related to an illuminance or irradiance that any individual tree is exposed to at night. Moreover, even in dark pixels, an individual tree adjacent to a street light may be exposed to bright light, while a tree in a large unlit urban park might be relatively dark despite being located in a bright pixel. However, the DMSP pixel brightness is probably a good indication of the density of outdoor light sources, and hence the probability of any tree within that pixel experiencing a relatively high level of direct illumination; observers recording the first budbreak in three trees in close proximity will therefore be considerably more likely to be recording trees exposed to artificial light in ‘bright’ than ‘dark’ pixels.
Our finding that phenology of woodland tree species may be affected by light pollution, suggests that smaller plants growing below the height of street lights are even more likely to be affected. Such results highlight the need to carry out experimental investigation into the impact of artificial night-time lighting on phenology and species interactions. It also suggests that looking at other aspects of phenology, such as leaf senescence, would be highly worthwhile. Importantly, further studies should also try and take into account differences in light quality such as the specific wavelengths of light generated by different lighting types.

"Australia’s untapped gas reservoirs could lead to three years’ worth of global greenhouse gas emissions if they were developed to their full extent, an analysis suggests. With the Morrison government proposing what it has described as a “gas-led recovery”, a report by the thinktank the Australia Institute has estimated the emissions that would be released if the fossil fuel industry were significantly expanded. Drawing on government data, it found there were 22 major gas production and export projects proposed across the country. There were also plans for unconventional gas production using fracking in the Canning basin in Western Australia and the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory. Together, the report said, these proposals could lead to about half a billion tonnes of emissions, roughly what Australia releases each year. The institute cited evidence from Geoscience Australia of two further categories of gas: “identified resources” of about 273,000 petajoules and “prospective and potentially recoverable” resources of between 500,000 and 2m petajoules. Australia now produces about 5,000 petajoules a year. It concluded if all potential gas resources were tapped it could lead to emissions equivalent to three times current annual global emissions, or twice as much as the combined historic emissions of the major industrial emitters Chevron, Exxon, BHP and Rio Tinto. The report was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation. The ACF chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said “unleashing the pollution from Australia’s full gas reserves would make it almost impossible for the world to meet Paris agreement goals”. Nobody expects all the potential gas resources will be extracted, but the Australia Institute’s climate energy director, Richie Merzian, said the analysis illustrated what could be available to the industry if it were subsidised by taxpayers. Scott Morrison’s handpicked National Covid-19 Coordinating Commission has recommended that the government underwrite new gas infrastructure and the prime minister has told parliament that expanding gas supply is critical to Australia’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. An estimate by the gas industry’s lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, suggested the country conservatively had more than 890,000 petajoules of gas, enough to power a city of 1 million people for 16,000 years. “We don’t know how much is going to be developed but the industry wants to do as much as possible and the government seems amenable to allowing and potentially subsidising as much as possible,” Merzian said. “When the scale and potential damage of the industry is fully understood it is hard for Australian policymakers to justify a so-called gas-fired recovery.” On Thursday the industry association’s chief executive, Andrew McConville, said the report was a “massive exaggeration” that substantially overestimated both the growth and emissions of the oil and gas industry. He said it overlooked the “complementary and enabling role” gas played alongside renewable energy. “This ACF and Australia Institute report is tired, discredited and intellectually vacuous activism masquerading as analysis,” McConnell said. Gas is often described as having about half the emissions of coal but studies have suggested this could be more due to leakage of methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas. In addition to being burned to create electricity, gas is used as a feedstock in some manufacturing industries. The Australian gas industry tripled in size over the past decade as the country became the world’s largest seller of liquefied natural gas. About three-quarters of the gas extracted is exported. The LNG industry is responsible for more than 10% of the country’s annual emissions, not counting what is released when the gas is burned offshore. The rise of an east coast gas export industry roughly tripled the price of gas for local consumers and businesses. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association and the government have argued the gas industry is good for the environment as it displaces coal in Asian countries and reduces global emissions. They have not produced evidence to support this claim. In at least some countries, notably Japan, gas has been forecast to compete with emissions-free nuclear and renewable energy. An analysis suggested Australia’s greenhouse gas accounting has underestimated national emissions by up to 10%, largely due to a failure to properly recognise the impact of methane released during gas production. The push for a gas expansion has broad business support, including from organisations that have argued Australia should set a target of net zero emissions by 2050. The Business Council of Australia’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, this week called for the removal of moratoriums on gas exploration in some states. But she told the ABC the federal government should “be very careful” before spending taxpayer’s money on the industry. O’Shanassy said the massive economic disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic would be dwarfed by the climate crisis “if our governments back dirty fossil fuels like gas over clean renewable energy and technology”."

As the G-8 summit to be held in Gleneagles, Scotland nears, the Bush Administration finds itself coming under increasing pressure to alter its course on climate change. A couple of weeks ago, British Prime Minister and acting G-8 head Tony Blair came to Washington to persuade President Bush to see global warming as a looming threat necessitating dramatic measures to abate it — measures that could be hammered out at the upcoming G-8 summit. All indications are that Blair was unsuccessful. Now, several leading U.S. newspapers have tried their hand at the issue by applying a different tactic — running stories which give the appearance of “exposing” an Administration conspiracy to suppress the true nature of the global warming problem.



For instance, the front page of the June 8th, 2005 _New York Times_ carried a piece by science writer Andrew Revkin that revealed edits to a government global warming reports that were made by White House Council on Environmental Quality chief of staff and former American Petroleum Institute employee Philip Cooney. An example of one such change that had Revkin concerned was “Mr. Cooney amplified the sense of uncertainty by adding the word ‘extremely’ to this sentence: ‘The attribution of the causes of biological and ecological changes to climate change or variability is extremely difficult.’ ”



Such trivialities led science and policy expert Roger Pielke Jr., to write on his weblog that the Revkin piece amounted to “Manufactured Controversy.” For instance, Pielke Jr. points out that one of the documents cited by Revkin as being altered by Cooney, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program’s Strategic Plan, later went on to be thoroughly reviewed and approved by the National Research Council. The NRC then endorsed its scientific content and recommend that it be implemented “with urgency.” Apparently Cooney’s edits weren’t found to be too objectionable by the NRC. 



Not satisfied to let the _Times_ have the monopoly on manufacturing controversy, 10 days later, on June 17th, 2005, the _Washington Post_ ran a front page article by staff writer Juliet Eilperin who claimed to have uncovered further evidence that the U. S. government was editing “scientific or policy documents to accord with its position that mandatory carbon dioxide cuts are unnecessary.” This time the guilty parties were U. S. negotiators who were involved in drafting some climate change verbiage to be discussed at the upcoming G-8 meeting. It seems that the negotiators had the audacity to be actively participating in preparing issues to be discussed at next month’s G-8 meeting (undoubtedly just like their counterparts from the other participating countries). The U.S. negotiators convinced the document preparers to replace language such as 





and





and





with the summary





There can be no doubt that this summary is accurate. Further, it is much more scientifically reasonable than the original text. For one thing, the need for “urgent action” is far from being established. Even the Joint Statement issued recently by the science academies of the G-8 countries really couldn’t come up with a compelling threat that they could agree upon.



What’s more, the drafters of the original text must have been completely unfamiliar with the earth’s climate history to write of “irreversible” changes to our planet. As the earth has spent the better part of the past 3 million years getting itself into, and even more impressively, out of ice ages, the climate shows a remarkable ability to reverse its course.



What all of this — the _Times_ article, the _Post_ article, and the Joint Statement — really amounts to is simply an all‐​out, last‐​ditch effort by global warming alarmists to find any excuse to compel the United States to take some sort of legislative action to regulate the emissions of greenhouse gases. The Bush Administration realizes that simply knowing that human activities are impacting the climate is not grounds for “urgent action” to do something about it. Especially given that the overwhelming majority of these human activities have made the world a better place and one capable of supporting a growing human population that now tops 6.5 billion people. A prudent person, or Administration, would think long and hard about scaling down such activities without compelling evidence that the results of not doing so will prove more detrimental than the active pursuit of their curtailment.

Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) have survived in Antarctica for nearly 45,000 years, adapting to glacial expansions and sea ice fluctuations driven by millennia of climatic changes. The penguins remained resilient through these changes, but new research from the University of Delaware suggests that unique 21st-century climates may pose an existential threat to many of the colonies on the Antarctic continent.


 
Published Wednesday in Scientific Reports, the study, led by oceanographer Megan Cimino, found that up to 60 percent of the current Adélie penguin habitat in Antarctica could be unfit to host colonies by the end of the century.

Believe it or not, I wrote the title of this post before reading past the second paragraph of the article or clicking the link to the Scientific Reports paper.  So, now let’s click the link to see if I have to change the title…

 
 

Abstract
The contribution of climate change to shifts in a species’ geographic distribution is a critical and often unresolved ecological question. Climate change in Antarctica is asymmetric, with cooling in parts of the continent and warming along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is a circumpolar meso-predator exposed to the full range of Antarctic climate and is undergoing dramatic population shifts coincident with climate change. We used true presence-absence data on Adélie penguin breeding colonies to estimate past and future changes in habitat suitability during the chick-rearing period based on historic satellite observations and future climate model projections. During the contemporary period, declining Adélie penguin populations experienced more years with warm sea surface temperature compared to populations that are increasing. Based on this relationship, we project that one-third of current Adélie penguin colonies, representing ~20% of their current population, may be in decline by 2060. However, climate model projections suggest refugia may exist in continental Antarctica beyond 2099, buffering species-wide declines. Climate change impacts on penguins in the Antarctic will likely be highly site specific based on regional climate trends, and a southward contraction in the range of Adélie penguins is likely over the next century.

Results
Adélie penguin CRHS models show the spatial distribution of novel climate and changes in CRHS compared to historic observations (Fig. 2). All CRHS models performed well (area under the curve (AUC) > 0.85) and confirmed the importance of SST, SIC and bare rock to penguin chick-rearing habitats (see Supplemental Results). In this study, novel climate is SST or SIC outside the range of average SST and SIC observations from 1978–1984 (−2.42 > SST > 1.55 °C, SIC > 95.41%), which corresponds to CRHS model training data (see methods). Interestingly, ~1.5 °C was roughly the warmest SST that increasing Adélie penguin populations experienced throughout the entire satellite record while many decreasing populations experienced SST warmer than this threshold (Supplemental Fig. 1). The WAP experienced the greatest number of novel climate years, with up to seven years of novel climate from 1981–2010 and over 40 years of novel climate using an ensemble of global climate model projections from 2011–2099 (Fig. 2a, see Supplemental Figs 2–9 for individual climate model output and Supplemental Fig. 10 for variability). Marguerite Bay appears to be on a slower warming trajectory compared to the WAP (Fig. 2a), which is also evident in the high-resolution GFDL-CM2.6 projections (Supplemental Fig. 9). While both the WAP and Ross Sea regions have been characterized by high CRHS in the recent past (Fig. 2b), our model projects a substantial decrease in CRHS along the WAP and an increase in CRHS in the Ross Sea over the next century (Fig. 2c). The Cape Adare region, home to the earliest known occupation and the largest Adélie colony4, had no novel climate and high CRHS in the past and future (Fig. 2a,b). CRHS in the Cape Adare region is also projected to increase in the future (Fig. 2c, Supplemental Fig. 11). At Cape Adare, SST is projected to increase from about −1 °C to 0 °C and SIC is projected to decrease from ~20% to ~10% by 2100 (Supplemental Fig. 11), with these changes in SST and SIC shifting towards peak suitability (see response curves, Supplemental Fig. 12). The northeastern Antarctic Peninsula appears to be a more favorable environment than the southwestern Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 2a,b). From 1981–2010, the South Shetland Islands and the WAP had a similar number of novel climate years and mean CRHS (Fig. 2a,b) but CRHS improved in the South Shetland Islands (Fig. 2c). During this time, the more northerly South Sandwich and South Orkney Islands experienced no years with novel climate, higher mean CRHS and improved CRHS compared to southerly islands and the WAP. Comparing two species distribution modeling approaches and two spatial subsets of the presence-absence data, we found the modeling methods (MaxEnt vs. GAMs) produced similar results but varied more when presence or absence data was incomplete. Model output was most sensitive to incomplete absence data, especially when true presence data was included, perhaps because absence data was missing within a specific environmental niche and Adélie penguins do not occupy all available habitats (Supplemental Results).

Scientific Reports
It appears that the penguins are doomed by cumulative “novel climate years.”  How did the authors calculate future “novel climate years”?
RCP 8.5, of course!  The paper even cites Deconto & Pollard.
Figure 4 from the paper…
Figure 4. Location map of Adélie penguin colonies and bare rock locations. Each line represents the mean of all colonies in that sector colored by the climate model used for the projection. Satellite observations of novel climate are in red from 1981–2010, IPCC models (RCP 8.5) from 2006–2099 and GFDL-CM2.6 from year 1–79 where atmospheric CO2 increases by 1% per year and atmospheric CO2 doubles at year 70 in the model simulation. The IPCC ensemble mean shows the average trend for all IPCC models in a sector (not including GFDL-CM2.6). See Supplemental Figs 13–20 for individual models. The map was produced in R version 3.1.3 (www.r-project.org).
From the supplemental information…


Maybe some Red State AG’s can investigate this.  Alarmist nonsense based on bad science fiction (RCP 8.5) must qualify as fraud.
Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant’s actions involved five separate elements: (1) a false statement of a material fact,(2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.

Addendum: RCP 8.5 Explained
RCP 8.5 = Relative Concentration Pathway 8.5
From RCP 8.5, Part Deux: “The stuff nightmares are made from.”
In most, if not all, catastrophic AGW papers, RCP 8.5 (or an equivalent) is invoked as a “business as usual scenario.”  A recent example can be found here.  The peer-reviewed paper said, “Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100.”  This was translated by journalists into, “Antarctic ice sheets are expected to double sea-level rise to two metres by 2100, if carbon emissions are not cut.”
There is a world of difference between “has the potential to” and “are expected to,” particularly when the “potential” is based on an insanely unrealistic scenario.
The Stuff Nightmares Are Made From
Dr. Judith Curry has a very thoughtful discussion of RCP 8.5, “the stuff nightmares are made from,” on her Climate Etc. blog…

(1) AN INTRODUCTION TO SCENARIOS ABOUT OUR FUTURE
In AR5 four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describe scenarios for future emissions, concentrations, and land-use, ending with radiative forcing levels of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100. Strong mitigation policies result in a low forcing level (RCP2.6). Two medium stabilization scenarios lead to intermediate outcomes: (RCP4.5, RCP6.0).

RCP8.5 gets the most attention. It assumes the fastest population growth (a doubling of Earth’s population to 12 billion), the lowest rate of technology development, slow GDP growth, a massive increase in world poverty, plus high energy use and emissions. For more about the RCPs see “The representative concentration pathways: an overview” by Detlef P. van Vuuren et al, Climatic Change, Nov 2011.
RCP8.5 assumes a nightmarish world even before climate impacts, resulting from substantial changes to long-standing trends. It provides AR5 with an essential worst case scenario necessary for conservative planning.
Unfortunately scientists often inaccurately describe RCP8.5 as the baseline scenario — a future without policy action: “a relatively conservative business as usual case with low income, high population and high energy demand due to only modest improvements in energy intensity” from “RCP 8.5: A scenario of comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions” by Keywan Riahi et al in Climate Change, November 2011, This is a material misrepresentation of RCP8.5. Scientists then use RCP8.5 to constructhorrific visions of the future. They seldom mention its unlikely assumptions.
“Scientists then use RCP8.5 to construct horrific visions of the future.”  Why would “scientists” feel compelled “to construct horrific visions of the future”?  Furthermore, why would they so often describe these “horrific visions of the future” as baseline, expected or “business as usual” scenarios?
Based on a real world “business as usual” emissions scenario, with natural gas displacing oil at its current pace and no carbon tax, I come up with a CO2 right about inline with RCP 6.0, “a mitigation scenario, meaning it includes explicit steps to combat greenhouse gas emissions (in this case, through a carbon tax)“.

Then I took my real world “business as usual” relative concentration pathway and applied three reasonable climate sensitivities to it: 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 °C per doubling of atmospheric CO2, starting at 280 ppmv (TCR 0.5, TCR 1.5 and TCR 2.5).  HadCRUT4, referenced to 1850-1879 is clearly tracking very close to TCR 1.5…

 
Since it is generally assumed that at least half of the warming since 1850 was natural, the actual climate sensitivity would have to be significantly lower than 1.5 °C per doubling.  Therefore, RCP 8.5 should never be described as “business as usual,” “expected” or a “baseline case.”  Since its assumptions are mind mindbogglingly unrealistic, it shouldn’t be used in any serious publication.  It is bad science fiction.

"My old university friend, the American geographer William Dyer, accepted my Skype call at a research station on the pebble shores of the Antarctic Sound. Once, it would have been too remote to receive messages and yet here I was, laughing at the Sub Pop Records baseball cap that fixed him temporally and culturally. Will had wanted to be free, free to do what he wanted to do. And he had wanted to get loaded and have a good time. But Will, a better man than I, discovered a conscience. And now he was watching ice melt. Will had been the first person to tell me about climate change, one long whiskey night in 1986, but the idea that the world was warming was absurd, just like his claim that one day we would piggyback on a worldwide military computer network to communicate face to face. And yet here we were doing just that and Will was in a shrinking southern ice field documenting exactly the kind of destruction I had doubted. I needed Will’s advice. The environmental action group Extinction Rebellion was asking minor celebrities, like me, to sign a letter in Sunday’s Observer countering the Boris Johnson government’s claims it was a criminal organisation, after it stopped the distribution of newspapers deemed hostile to its aims from Rupert Murdoch’s plants. I was interested in William’s position. “Well, Extinction Rebellion is of course right to be extremely alarmed,” he said, “but I suppose, philosophically, it might be worth your clarifying the distinction between a criminal action and a moral one.” William allowed me to answer him in one long stream-of-consciousness rant, a skill honed through 30 years of echo-chamber leftwing standup. “You’re right of course, Will,” I began. “But the verified crimes of Boris Johnson himself are many and varied and range from the irrelevant to the indefensible. He claims to have been arrested for plant-pot related restaurant vandalism while a student member of an elite restaurant vandalism society; was sacked from the Times for inventing quotes impugning the 13th-century nobleman Piers Gaveston; agreed to find his friend Darius Guppy the address of a journalist the convicted fraudster wanted to give “a couple of black eyes and a cracked rib”; used cocaine, though claims he imbibed with the lack of accuracy or care typical of his approach to politics; accrued multiple parking fines while reviewing cars for the monthly sex-gadgets journal GQ; built an ostentatious shed on his balcony without planning permission, making his Islington neighbours choke on their Fair Trade LGBTQIA hessian duffel-coat espadrille dinner-party muesli; used discreet water sprayers to suppress air pollution levels around monitoring stations in the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics, inadvertently contributing to the long-term critical health problems of thousands of vulnerable children; failed to declare a conflict of interest regarding his friendship with a pole-dancing technology instructor; lied about Turkish accession to the EU; lied on a bus about EU savings that could be transferred to the NHS; lied about an affair and so was dismissed from the post of shadow arts minister; lied about public support for a no-deal Brexit and so was censured by the Independent Press Standards Organisation in April 2019; failed nine times to declare his full earnings from the Daily Telegraph when he should have done, in breach of ministerial codes; lied about the reasons for not singing Rule, Britannia! at the Proms; lied by colluding in the distribution of undated images of al fresco long-hair dining to shore up the perceived stability of his relationship with Carrie Symonds; and lied to the Queen to unlawfully prorogue parliament. And yet here is Boris Pot-Crime Gaveston-Crime Address-Crime Cocaine-Crime Parking-Crime Shed-Crime Pollution-Crime Pole-Crime Turkish-Crime Bus-Crime Affair-Crime No-Deal-Crime Telegraph-Crime Proms-Crime Hair-Crime Queen-Crime Johnson, asking the Home Office to reclassify Extinction Rebellion as a “criminal” organisation. And Boris Johnson calling Extinction Rebellion a criminal organisation is the pot calling the kettle black. And that pot had probably been thrown through the window of an Oxford restaurant in the 1980s anyway. Or been smoked. Or something. And the kettle isn’t called “black”. It is called a “picaninny”. Yes! That’s it!! Boris Johnson is the pot that has been thrown through a restaurant window or smoked, calling the kettle a picaninny. Let’s see that sentence trending on Twitter! Could a rightwing comedian have thought of that? No! That is why I was called “The World’s Greatest Living Standup” by the reputable and honest Times newspaper in 2018. And you’re watching ice melt in a wilderness!!” “OK, Tiger, petty, personality-driven political point-scoring is too trivial a framing device for this debate. Let’s make this more of a Socratic dialogue and less of an ego trip,” said Will, harshing my buzz. “Critics will claim that Extinction Rebellion’s actions strike at the democratic notion of a free press. But from a moral perspective, when rising temperatures have destroyed our world as we know it, perhaps the cockroaches that inherit the planet will fashion from their stinking dung enormous reverential statues of the heroic Extinction Rebellion ‘criminals’ that tried to save us from ourselves.” “Yes, Will,” I agreed, sarcastically, “but the man who reviewed filth-producing cars for a filthy magazine and then left them lying around abandoned before going off to waste the Earth’s resources on illegal sheds while hiding behind the human shield of his puffin-cherishing environmentalist partner, will be rightly identified as a real “criminal” of the Anthropocene period. And slowly, the cockroaches will roll Boris Johnson’s statue off the crumbling quay, into the last dry puddle of the still boiling ocean et cetera, et cetera. Look, do I sign this letter or what?” But there was no answer. Through the window of his cabin I could see Will outside on the beach, open mouthed, head in hands. In the time we had been goofing around, arguing the point like student showoffs, another vast shelf of ice had slipped silently into the sea."
"February 2020 has brought more than its fair share of bad weather to the north of England, the Midlands and Wales. Shrewsbury, Bewdley and Telford swam in the Severn, while the Ouse invaded York. For some, the adage that it’s grim up north rang true. The recent flooding is a reminder that all parts of the UK are vulnerable to natural hazards, and the costs aren’t just economic. Flood water can enter a building in minutes, but the impact on communities can last years. Flooded homes and businesses take months to clean up and dry out, and the long-term impact on the health and relationships of those affected is often overlooked. Climate change has made some types of floods more likely, but past government policy has ensured that the ensuing crises are worse than they might otherwise have been. While there’s an urgent need for new homes, 1.8 million people currently live in areas at significant risk of flooding, and homes are still being built on floodplains. The chief executive of the Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, argued that if we must build in the floodplain, homes should be built with garages on the ground floor and living space upstairs, to ensure floods cause minimal damage. This might sound radical, but some of the oldest buildings along Britain’s rivers and coastline, such as millhouses and warehouses, have stone floors and steps up to first floor entrances. They were designed hundreds of years ago to ensure their occupants could ride out intermittent flooding.  Climate change may force countries, such as the UK, to adopt radical practices from parts of the world that flood more frequently, such as houses that are designed to float when floods come, rising on stilts as the water rises. It’s an idea that is familiar to those living in stilt houses beside the Amazon river, and it’s also found favour in the Netherlands. For those who already live on the floodplain, there are less dramatic but important adaptations that can be made. Internally reinforced, mechanically sealable flood doors can be installed to keep water out. Carpets and wooden floorboards that soak up dirty flood waters can be swapped for waterproof concrete and stone-slab floors. Electrical sockets can be raised and non-return valves can be fitted to toilets to stop sewage filling homes when it floods. Making Britain more resilient to floods is not just a task for individuals. The government now has an opportunity to prove its long-term commitment to the north of England in particular, by creating detailed plans to increase resilience to floods. Backing the HS2 railway and moving the House of Lords out of London might grab headlines, but making sure the region is resilient in the face of future flooding requires less glamorous investment. It’s equally important that money isn’t just thrown at the areas that were flooded last – or which might have voted Conservative in the last election. Every flooded community, no matter where they are in the country, deserves support, and managing flood risk is about more than just installing large flood defences or water-proofing homes. A long-term approach requires policies that link the necessary changes in land use, agriculture, housing and development. Part of this could give communities the power to take control of their own destiny by creating regional flood forums, giving residents’ groups a say in how communities prepare for and respond to floods. Too many people are left with the impression that the government, or other distant authorities, can be trusted with sole responsibility for preventing flooding, and are then left feeling powerless and abandoned when floods happen.  It’s essential that everyone who lives in or moves to an area at risk of flooding knows that the risk of flooding is real. It’s difficult to imagine that your home could be flooded if you have never seen water lapping at your front door or rising up your kitchen cabinets. This is especially true for those living in properties that don’t immediately border running water.  But the historical record tells us that even before modern climate change, big floods have always happened. And floods are like buses, sometimes nothing happens for ages and then several come, one after the other. Flood risk maps exist, but the message is not getting through to those who need them.  Perhaps flood risk should come to be seen like earthquake risk zones in other countries. It would mean public signs clearly positioned to show that you are in a flood zone and that there is danger to life, health and property. It would ensure that strong building regulations are adhered to and school lessons are specifically devoted to knowing how to keep people safe.  We certainly need new ideas for connecting people with the realities of living with climate change. Ensuring that everyone can find out about their flood risk, shape decision-making on land management, and adapt their homes accordingly could empower people to prepare for the floods that will inevitably come.

My greener friends are rejoicing over the apparent “conversion” of Richard Muller, head of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) research team, from “climate change skeptic” to believer in global warming. A closer read of his _New York Times_ op‐​ed, published on July 30, during what is climatologically the hottest week of the year, would certainly cool their enthusiasm.



In it, Muller discusses the fact that the surface temperature of the planet indeed is warmer than it was at the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. While not one climate scientist finds this at all newsworthy, his “admission” has been ballyhooed in environmental circles as a defection that will end the Hot War. Trouble is, Muller’s statements don’t come close to any sort of radical retraction — and there is evidence his conclusions are obviously flawed to begin with.



There are three philosophies in the world of global warming. Loudest are the “hotheads,” who maintain that drastic (and impossible) measures are needed to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and prevent the seas from rising dozens of feet in a hundred years. The data relied upon by this segment is suspect, but their alarmist message garners more than its share of attention.



The recognized antithesis of hotheads are the “flatliners,” who contend that there is no measurable warming caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Their bible is the lack of warming in the last 16‐​odd years, when CO2 levels have risen the most. They do have a problem explaining the rise in temperatures in the preceding decades.



In the third school, where I find myself, reside the “lukewarmers” — those who argue that carbon dioxide indeed is warming surface temperatures, but that its effect is modest and that we are inadvertently adapting. Our mantra: “It’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity.” In other words, most climate projections assume that surface temperature is overly sensitive to “forcing” from carbon dioxide. Our bible consists of observed temperature trends as CO2 increased in the last several decades.



I would like to welcome Dr. Muller to the noble fellowship of lukewarmers.



In his op‐​ed, he forecast that land surface temperatures will rise 1.5°F over the next 50 years. That’s about the same amount that they rose since 1900 — and in the intervening period, life expectancy doubled and per‐​capita income in constant dollars rose tenfold in the United States.



Muller wrote an important caveat, which is that warming would be much greater if atmospheric carbon dioxide rocketed upwards. Rapidly _declining_ emissions in the U.S., resulting in large part from the exponential substitution of natural gas (sourced from shale), instead of coal for electrical generation, suggest this is not likely. Shale is ubiquitous worldwide, and what began here is likely to spread around the planet.



Note that Dr. Muller is talking about land temperatures, which applies to about 30% of the earth’s surface. Given that the remaining 70% that is water tends to warm at about 60% of the land rate, his _global_ warming forecast is 1.1°F by 2060, which is precisely lukewarm.



For comparative purposes, the median 2010–2060 warming predicted by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is around 2.7°F. NASA’s James Hansen, the head hothead, has it at around 2.4° for his “Scenario B,” which implies some reduction in emissions from “business‐​as‐​usual” (BAU). “Scenario A,” which Hansen explicitly labels BAU, yields a whopping 5.6°, which Hansen now says is on the high side.



So what does the hothead community think of Muller?



For one thing, they can’t be happy with his science, which attributes past warming almost exclusively to carbon dioxide increases. Hansen has a whole host of other “forcings,” including black carbon (soot) that Muller simply eschews.



The hotheads are also surely upset that Muller doesn’t acknowledge that sulfate emissions from the combustion of coal and forests countervail warming.



Penn State climatologist and renowned hothead Michael Mann gave Muller’s conclusions his review in a Facebook post from last weekend: “At this rate, Muller should be caught up to the current state of climate science within a matter of a few years.”



Susan Solomon of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has to wonder how Muller could have ignored the effect of water vapor changes in the stratosphere, which she says are responsible for 15% of warming since 1980 (and are also implicated in the lack of warming since 1996).



As a result of these and other peccadilloes, the BEST team has yet to publish one peer‐​reviewed paper, despite conspicuously dominating the op‐​ed pages for a year now. Their critical paper on the “urban heat island” — which concludes there isn’t one — has been outright rejected. Apparently, the BEST team doesn’t believe that it is warmer in downtown Washington, D.C., than it is in rural Virginia, thanks in part to the waste heat from all the money changing hands, some of which funds BEST.



I am waiting for Muller to respond that his forecast was a typo, and that he meant degrees Celsius rather than Fahrenheit (the units explicitly used earlier in his op‐​ed). Even so, he would still come in far below the IPCC, which bills itself as “the consensus of scientists.” Let’s hope he wasn’t that careless.



Welcome to the lukewarm club, Dr. Muller.

"**US President Donald Trump has signed an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, after China enacted a new security law there.**
Hong Kong would be treated ""the same as mainland China"", Mr Trump said. He also signed a law to impose sanctions on officials who cracked down on rights.
China has strongly criticised the move, vowing to take retaliatory action.
The US sees the security law as a threat to the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed under a 1984 agreement.
That special status was agreed between China and Hong Kong's former colonial power, the UK, before sovereignty was returned to Beijing in 1997.
The new security law - which outlaws criticism of China's government - is the most sweeping change to the political landscape of Hong Kong since then.
Speaking in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his executive order would end preferential treatment for Hong Kong.
""No special privileges, no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies,"" said the president, who first announced in May that his administration would begin paring back the territory's special status.
He also told reporters he had signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which passed unanimously in Congress earlier this month.
""This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom,"" Mr Trump told the news conference.
After being questioned by a journalist, the president said he had no plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
He also told reporters that ""we hold China fully responsible for concealing the [coronavirus] and unleashing it upon the world"".
Mr Trump's own administration is under scrutiny for its response to the pandemic. The US has 3.4 million recorded cases, the highest in the world, and more than 136,000 deaths.
The president's policy address digressed into a lengthy political attack on his Democratic presidential challenger, Joe Biden, ranging from trade and immigration to policing and climate change.
China's foreign ministry condemned the latest US moves, saying they were a ""gross interference"" in its domestic affairs.
In a strongly-worded statement, it said the country would also impose retaliatory sanctions against US individuals and entities to ""safeguard China's legitimate interests"".
""The US attempt to obstruct the implementation of the national security law for Hong Kong will never succeed,"" the statement said.
""We urge the US side to correct its mistakes, refrain from implementing the act and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way. China will firmly respond if the US goes ahead.""
It was not a matter of if, but when. Scrapping Hong Kong's special status will mean companies based there will now have to evaluate what this means for them.
Hong Kong is a re-exporting hub, which means that goods that go through Hong Kong to the US but have come from somewhere else - like China for instance - have avoided the tariffs the US has slapped on China.
Now that Hong Kong's special status is gone - mainland Chinese companies may look for another place to send their goods - which would see Hong Kong's port and logistics businesses suffer.
And how much of an impact will this have on American and multinational companies using Hong Kong as a regional hub? Well, as one business consultant told me - the structural reasons for why a company would use Hong Kong as a hub are still there - low tax rates, good geographic location, convertibility of currency.
But perception is reality - and if the perception is that doing business in Hong Kong has become so much more onerous - why not decamp to mainland China or Singapore instead?
Washington-Beijing ties have become increasingly frayed in recent months.
With Mr Trump facing an uphill battle for re-election this November, he and Mr Biden have accused each other of being weak on China.
On Monday, the administration condemned China's military build-up in the South China Sea, accusing it of bullying neighbours.
Last Friday, Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a ""phase two"" trade deal with China was in doubt because of its handling of coronavirus, which he called the ""plague"".
The US also officially withdrew last week from the World Health Organization, which Mr Trump had accused of being beholden to China.
Last week, too, the Trump administration announced sanctions against Chinese politicians who it says are responsible for human rights violations against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis weekend Germany is getting its first summerlike weather (after having seen snow earlier in the month), with temperatures forecast to reach 30°C or more in some parts of Germany.
And already a number of media outlets and WetterOnline, for example, have announced that a “heat wave” will roll across the country over the coming days.
But as Schneefan at climate and weather site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de points out, you really have got to wonder what the media and some weather outlets are thinking here. This all borders on real comedy.
Wetter online.de wrote:
Perfect timing: Precisely during what will be for many a long holiday weekend, the first heat wave of the year is rolling in. Already on Saturday along the Rhine area temperatures of 30°C are in the works. On Saturday and Monday it’ll be around 30°C hot everywhere...“
“Around 30°C hot”…, on Saturday and Monday? This is a heat wave?
“Meteorological nonsense”
Schneefan thinks it’s ridiculous, and calls it “meteorological nonsense” when one looks at the definition of a heat wave, provided by Wetteronline no less:

It is considered a heat wave when the high temperature reaches 30°C or more over five or more consecutive days.”
“That certainly isn’t going to happen in Germany at the end of May 2017,” Schneefan comments. “Two days of heat don’t make a heat wave, but they do cause waves from the media.”
30°C temperatures in fact spotty, short-lived
Looking at major cities across Germany, we see in fact that temperatures will be 30°C or higher only over a few hours during the “heat wave”. Berlin will see only about 5 hours of 30°C. Frankfurt will see some three days with temps reaching 30°C or higher, for a total of roughly 15 hours.
Munich and Hamburg aren’t going to see the 30°C mark at all during the year’s first “heat wave”. Hanover will see one day (Monday) with 30°C – for about a whopping whole 3 hours!
The 7-day outlook for the 2m temperature shows in fact rather substantial cooling across much of Europe:

"**China has formally adopted a controversial security law, giving it new powers over Hong Kong and deepening fears for its freedoms.**
It is set to criminalise secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, but will also effectively curtail protests and freedom of speech.
The move follows increasing unrest and a widening pro-democracy movement.
Pro-democracy organisation Demosisto reacted to the news by announcing it was ceasing all operations.
Earlier Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded.
But some other veteran activists have said they will join a key march on Wednesday, despite the risk of arrest under the new law.
China's state news agency, Xinhua, confirmed that President Xi Jinping had now signed the security law. It has been added to Hong Kong's Basic Law, the 50-year mini-constitution agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned to China by the UK in 1997.
Its terms are not yet clear, meaning residents still do not know the measures they will have to abide by. The law could be implemented as early as Wednesday.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab expressed ""deep concern"" at the reports the law had been passed, saying: ""This would be a grave step.""
The law has sparked demonstrations in Hong Kong since it was announced by Beijing in May. China says it is needed to tackle unrest and instability and rejects criticism as interference in its affairs.
The law went through unanimously in a session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing.
It comes a day before the 23rd anniversary of the handover from Britain to China - a date usually marked by pro-democracy protests.
It will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism and collusion with foreign or external forces.
A new office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools.
In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser.
Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence.
Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority.
For many, the law undermines the freedoms that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China and helped define its character.
People in Hong Kong prize civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an entirely independent and robust judiciary, as permitted in the Basic Law.
In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement.
In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined.
She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion.""
Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation. Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening.
Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges.
No. Those who will be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing.
So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation?
Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly.
The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp.
But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law.
Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a police ban on Wednesday's ""handover day"" march.
He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear.""
Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby, the South China Morning Post reports.
Announcing that it would ""dissolve and stop all meetings"", the Demosisto group said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"" and on ""different fronts"".
Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"".
President of the European Council Charles Michel said on Tuesday the law risked seriously undermining Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We deplore this decision.""
Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong.
Washington on Monday began moves to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship with the US.
On Tuesday, China said it would respond to the removal with unspecified ""countermeasures"".
The UK earlier said it would change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong ""a route to citizenship"" if China went ahead with the legislation."

I’m sad to say that the woke virus has hit again. This time it has infected the Wombles. The Telegraph reports.



The Wombles of Wimbledon Common have always enjoyed a quiet life, picking up litter, recycling, and trying to make the world a greener place.



Yep, remember them well. Even had the record.



But a new revamp of the popular 1970s BBC series has come under fire from the family of their creator, who say that attempts to make them politically correct and ethnically diverse insinuate that their mother was racist, and that it insults her memory.



In January, a new CGI trailer of the show was teased on social media, showing two of the fictional creatures with different skin tones hugging, along with the caption: “Diversity is beautiful. In humans, in animals, in nature.” 



The remake has come about after businessman Craig Treharne bought a controlling stake in the franchise off Mike Batt, the composer of the show’s theme tune, leaving the family of Elisabeth Beresford, the creator of the Wombles, with just a 15 per cent share.



Marcus Robertson, Mrs Beresford’s son, said it was clear that the show was heading in a new direction and that he had been led to believe that his mother’s views had been racist when he was told the characters needed to be more relatable.



“Outdated” is usually the term used.



“Wombles have grey fur and orangey-brown faces,” [he told ](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8087251/Accusing-Wombles-racist-insult-Elisabeth-Beresfords-memory-says-son.html)[the](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8087251/Accusing-Wombles-racist-insult-Elisabeth-Beresfords-memory-says-son.html)[ Mail on Sunday.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8087251/Accusing-Wombles-racist-insult-Elisabeth-Beresfords-memory-says-son.html)



“They’re not white. They’re not black. Wombles are Wombles. If you made a children’s television series about blackbirds, you wouldn’t create whitebirds, would you?



[…]The new social media push around the series shows the wombles branching out into wider social issues. They celebrated International Women’s Day, thanking all the “women guardians of the planet”, 



advised people to “travel smarter” in an attempt to fight climate change, and also declared their love for “tree huggers” because they are the “lungs of the earth.”



In other words, a once great children’s cultural institution has now become a mouthpiece for progressivism, especially global warming.



[…]One source close to the show told the Sunday paper: “The original Wombles came from a different era and some of the things they say could come across as sexist or not politically correct for today’s audience.



Which is basically woke speech for “go away you sexist racist old fart.”



Lawyers for Mr Treharne declined to comment in detail on Mr Robertson’s claims [but told the Mail on](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8087251/Accusing-Wombles-racist-insult-Elisabeth-Beresfords-memory-says-son.html)[ ](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8087251/Accusing-Wombles-racist-insult-Elisabeth-Beresfords-memory-says-son.html)[Sunday](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8087251/Accusing-Wombles-racist-insult-Elisabeth-Beresfords-memory-says-son.html): “Mr Robertson’s views are not shared by Wombles Copyright Holdings Limited or the Wombles. WCHL and the Wombles believe in an inclusive and diverse world, where everybody should be treated equally.”



Go woke, go [broke](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/rugby-australias-slide-into-wokeness-costs-even-more-millions/). I can confidently predict that kids will hate woke Wombles.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman wind energy protest site windwahn.de (windmadness.de) tells us of a new study: “Numerical modelling of micro-seismic and infrasound noise radiated by a wind turbine” and the possible the effects on human health.
It turns out that not only infrasound have negative impacts on humans, but perhaps so do the micro-seismic waves that turbine vibrations generate in the ground. In the new study, the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT), in partnership with University Patras of Greece, examined the micro-seismic and infrasound noise radiated by a wind turbine.
Higher levels of noise inside a house
According to the study’s highlights, modeling of the operation of a wind turbine under strong winds generated micro-seismic waves that would cause annoyance for neighbors. 2D simulations were performed for a specific geometry and a structure located 500 m far from a wind turbine. The most important conclusions:
(i) the micro-seismicity creates higher levels of noise inside a house than that of the airborne noise radiated by a wind turbine and
(ii) bedrock being in low depths underneath the soil has an additional contribution to the generated acoustic noise by the induced micro-seismicity.”
The study also found that micro-seismic waves impact the measurements of seismological centers that were even 15 km away from a wind turbine farm and that the “larger disturbances occurred at a frequency range of 5-10 Hz“.
The abstract of the study:
Infrasound, low frequency noise and soil vibrations produced by large wind turbines might disturb the comfort of nearby structures and residents. In addition repowering close to urban areas produces some fears to the nearby residents that the level of disturbance may increase. Due to wind loading, the foundation of a wind turbine interacts with the soil and creates micro-seismic surface waves that propagate for long distances and they are able to influence adversely sensitive measurements conducted by laboratories located far from the excitation point. A numerical study on the creation and propagation of those waves to the surrounding area is the subject of the present work. Besides, the contribution of those waves to airborne sound generated by the soil-air interaction is also investigated. All numerical simulations are performed with the aid of the Boundary Element Method (BEM), which is ideal for solving such problems since it takes automatically into account the radiation conditions of the waves and thus only the soil-foundation interface and the free surface of the surrounding soil are needed to be discretized. Foundation and soil are considered as linearly elastic materials with interfacial bonding. The frequency domain Helmholtz equation is employed for the simulation of acoustic waves. Numerical results dealing with the airborne and soil borne noise propagation and attenuation are presented and disturbances that might be caused to nearby and far-field structures are discussed.”

Potential health risks
Windwahn.de advises of the potential health risks at their site:
The determined frequency range of the largest disturbances found in the the study of 5 – 10 Hz, according to KIT University Patras are within the natural frequencies of, for example, the following organs:
Abdomen (4-10 Hz), general poor feeling (4-9 Hz), chest (5-7 Hz), impact on breathing (4-8 Hz), shoulder area (4-5 Hz), bent knee (2 Hz), arm (5-10 Hz),
Spine: (10-12 Hz)
Dr. Amanda Harry, UK, as to G. Rasmussen, DK and the Robert Koch Institute and ISO Standards 2631
Many of the described illness symptoms influenced by acoustic noise are found in the above mentioned organs.”
So not only is infrasound a problem for human health, but also the ground vibrations produced by vibrating wind turbines are likely to impact humans as well.
So far not a single German media outlet has reported on the findings. Not exactly the thing the public should know about in these times of wind energy profiteering.

"**A leading Hong Kong university has fired its law professor, Benny Tai, due to a criminal conviction over his role in the 2014 pro-democracy protests.**
Mr Tai, 56, accused the University of Hong Kong (HKU) of bowing to pressure from Beijing and said the ruling was ""the end of academic freedom"".
Mr Tai was one of the founders of the ""umbrella protests"" that paralysed Hong Kong's business districts for weeks.
Last year, a court sentenced him to 16 months in prison for his role.
He was granted bail in August, pending an appeal.
The 2014 protests, which were largely peaceful, lasted for more than 70 days as people took to the streets to call for democracy.
The university governing council's decision to dismiss Mr Tai goes against a previous ruling by its senate, which said while Mr Tai had committed misconduct, there were insufficient grounds to dismiss him.
According to local media, 18 members of the university's committee voted for his removal, with two against.
If he wishes to appeal the decision, he would have to either go through the university's chancellor \- Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam - or a judicial review, the South China Morning Post reports.
Writing in a Facebook post, Mr Tai said: ""Academic staff in education institutions in Hong Kong are no longer free to make controversial statements to the general public about politically or socially controversial matters.""
The decision to fire him was ""made not by the University of Hong Kong but by an authority beyond the University through its agents,"" he said, adding ""I am heartbroken to witness the demise of my beloved university.""
The university said in a statement that it had ""resolved a personnel issue concerning a teaching staff member"" after a ""stringent and impartial due process"".
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-Beijing Liaison Office, which represents Beijing's government in Hong Kong, welcomed his removal, saying: ""The University of Hong Kong's decision to fire Benny Tai is a move that punishes evil and praises the virtuous.""
Chinese state media has accused him of colluding with foreign forces and described him as a ""hardcore troublemaker"".
The university's ruling comes weeks after a controversial security law was passed in the city, giving China more powers there.
The law criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, but critics say that the terms are vaguely defined and the law effectively curtails Hong Kong's freedoms.
It also comes amid local media reports that elections to Hong Kong's parliament - the Legislative Council - could be postponed by a year. News outlets HK01, Hong Kong Economic Times and TVB said the government had made the decision, which is yet to be formally announced, due to coronavirus concerns.
Mr Tai has been accused by the Hong Kong-Beijing Liaison Office of trying to launch a revolution. He had helped organise opposition primaries earlier this month, which attracted hundreds of thousands of voters."
"The first UK climate assembly made up of members of the public is calling for a tax on frequent flyers, a ban on selling SUVs and a cut in meat consumption as part of the Covid-19 economic recovery. The assembly was made up of 108 people from all walks of life, who took part in meetings to discuss reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A final report of the assembly said recovering from Covid-19 should be used as an opportunity to hit net zero carbon emissions and drive different lifestyles to tackle the climate crisis, including a frequent flyers tax and a reduction in meat and dairy consumption. A large majority, 79% of the assembly, strongly agreed, or agreed, that economic recovery after the pandemic must be designed to help drive the country to its 2050 net zero target, which was signed into law last year. These steps should include limits or conditions on investment in high carbon industries, and government encouragement for lifestyles to become more compatible with reaching net zero. The assembly, which met for 6,000 hours across six weekends over 2020, said strong and clear leadership was needed. “Leadership to forge a cross-party consensus that allows for certainty, long-term planning and a phased transition,” the report, published on Thursday, said. “This is not the time nor the issue for scoring party political points.” The assembly examined key areas which need to be addressed, with four experts guiding the members of the public in their decision-making. . It is similar to the model adopted in France by Emmanuel Macron.  Key recommendations in the report included: Frequent flyer tax for individuals who fly furthest and most often. Increased government investment in low carbon buses and trains. An early shift to electric vehicles. An urgent ban on selling heavily polluting vehicles such as SUVs. Grants for people to buy low-carbon cars. A reduction in the amount we use cars by 2–5% per decade. Making wind and solar energy a key part of how the UK reaches net zero. Greater reliance on local produce and local food production. A change in diet – driven by education – to reduce meat and dairy consumption by between 20% and 40%. Parliament agreed in June 2019, when Theresa May was prime minister, to set in law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But a recent report by the Institute for Government said the UK government had not yet confronted the scale of the task. “Meeting the commitment is a more difficult challenge than responding to the coronavirus crisis or getting Brexit done, and will require transformations in every sector of the UK economy, sustained investment over three decades and substantial changes to everyone’s lives,” the report said. In its final recommendations, the UK climate assembly said there were key themes for the country as it moved towards net zero. Education and information about climate change and the steps to tackle it was needed for individuals, businesses, government and others. And any measures taken to cut emissions needed to be applied fairly. “Fair to people with jobs in different sectors. Fair to people with different incomes, travel preferences and housing arrangements. Fair to people who live in different parts of the UK,” the assembly said. It also called for freedom and choice for individuals and local areas to be embedded in the solutions to cut emissions and said tackling climate change could be beneficial for local communities, high streets and local businesses and boost the economy, promote innovation, improve health and reduce pollution. Chairs of the six parliamentary select committees that commissioned the assembly report have written to the prime minister, urging him to ensure that the government acts on the recommendations of Climate Assembly UK by “showing leadership at the very highest level of government” ahead of the UK hosting the UN climate summit, COP26, in November 2021. Darren Jones MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “The range of voices within these pages reflect our population. The fact that assembly members have been able to arrive at clear recommendations whilst respecting each others’ values and experiences sets an example for us all. “Participants speak of their learning, how they clarified their views and their respect for each other’s perspectives, even when they didn’t agree. Their voices are front and centre, just as they should be.”"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The question might seem insane – but in a recent Fox News interview, a Democrat supporter expressed an interest, in finding out what ISIS thinks about global warming.

Original Source: http://www.wnd.com/2016/07/3543994/
Its easy to write the guy in the video off as just being an idiot, but the reality is more complex. Consider that prominent politicians like President Obama have frequently insisted that Global Warming is a greater threat than terrorism.
Imagine just for a moment that you believed those assurances.
From this perspective, wouldn’t it just maybe make sense to try to reach out to bloodthirsty Islamic terrorists, to try to find common ground, in the greater struggle to contain what you believed was an existential threat to the entire world?
I don’t know what ISIS thinks about Global Warming, but terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden certainly saw the potential of exploiting global warming fears. Towards the end of his career, Bin Laden tried to reach out to climate activists, to invite them to join his global jihad.

Share this...FacebookTwitterStrongly fluctuating snow cover in Switzerland appears to be coupled to ocean cycles
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
For those who love snow, there are supposedly dark clouds on the horizon. Snow is becoming less and less. Never in the past has snow been as seldom as it is today. In the past it was always there when we needed it. Climate change, however, is putting an end to it. It’s a sad story that everyone has been reading in the newspapers. Of course humans are to blame.
It turns out many of these stories in the press are relatively scant on facts. We’ve reported with a number of hard facts on this topic on a number of occasions, and they don’t exactly fit very well with the alarmist narrative.
Today we are taking a look at Switzerland to see how snow has been doing in the land of the Alps over the past years and what we might expect for the future. In WIREs Climate Change, Martin Beniston provided and overview in 2012 on the Swiss snow trends over the past 90 years (Figure 1).
If you look at the curves for mean snow depth for the 10 stations, we see a great amount of natural variability. Beniston sees a relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is an important ocean cycle.

Figure 1: Snow depth curves during the winter months for 10 representative stations at 500 – 2700 m elevation: Zurich, 556 m; St Gallen, 779 m; Chateau d’Oex, 985 m; Engelberg, 1035 m; Scuol, 1298 m; Montana, 1508 m; Davos, 1590 m; Segl-Maria, 1798 m; Arosa, 1840 m; Weissfluhjoch, 2690 m. running five year mean. Source: Beniston 2012.
Now let’s examine the duration of snow cover (Fig. 2). Once again we see enormous natural variability. We do not see a trend to shorter snow seasons, and the curve fluctuates wildly.

The WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research describes the Swiss trends at his website as follows:
An analysis of snow depths over many years shows that the annual snowpack is subject to large variations, both from year to year, and as regards location (northern/southern flank of the Alps, western/eastern Switzerland, prealps/Alps).
These huge natural fluctuations are the hallmark of the snowpack in wintertime. For this reason, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions concerning climate-related changes in the snowpack or avalanche activity. Most of the winters in the 1980s, for example, were accompanied by large, rather than smaller quantities of snow. In contrast, towards the end of the 20th century, many measuring stations recorded minimum snowfall. The winters of the 21st century to date have shown a slight recovery, but snow depths are generally below average.
Clear reduction in the Mitteland and prealps
The described changes are more apparent, the lower the altitude of the observation station. Especially in the Mitteland region, the last 20 years are regarded as having the least snowfall since conventional measurements began about 130 years ago – and, according to historical records, the least for 300 years or more. A more exact analysis shows that the trend towards less snowy winters for most stations below 1300 m is statistically significant.
At stations above 2000 m, there is as yet no indication of a reduction in snow depths attributable to climate change. Further investigations have made it clear, moreover, that the reduced snow depths are primarily a consequence of higher winter temperatures, rather than a reduction in precipitation. An analysis of the seasonal differences shows a slight trend towards small amounts of snow in the early winter at intermediate altitudes, and indications of amplified melting during the spring at all altitudes.”

And because of the strong variability measured in the winter, it is also valid for Christmastime. Balz Rittmeyer and Marc Fehr have closely examined snow statistics for Switzerland and come up with an amazing result, and reported it at their blog at the Tagesanzeiger:
The White Christmas myth
Also this year there wasn’t any snow in the lowlands. Whoever thinks there was snow more often during the Christmas holidays in the past, they should look at these data. Is climate change responsible for fewer white Christmases? No. A look at the statistics shows that on December 24 and 25 there was not more snow in the past. Over the measured dataset is almost 80 years long and there is no detectable trend to see. In fact the longest stretch of Christmas without snow occurred from 1941 to 1949.”
Read the whole article at the blog of the Tagesanzeiger. Also the 2016/17 winter has shown us the unpredictability of Swiss snow cover. The online SRF wrote on 28 April 2017:
Record snow at St. Gallen: Never has there been this much snow, so late
This morning the weather reporter of the City of St. reported a snow depth of 26 centimeters. Since mid April this has never happened. The data go back to 1959. The previous record was 25 centimeters in the year 2001, on April 22. Now the record value has been pushed back almost one week. The second half of spring is defined as the middle of April to the end of May. Up to now there has been a maximum of 25 centimeters, namely in January. Also interesting: For the previous record it was the same. On April 22 there was also more snow than there was in the previous winter.”
St. Gallen is 675 m elevation, and well represents a lower elevation station. So will the trend in the middle of the country mean less snow in the winter?

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Renewables in their current form are a nonsense solution to the world’s energy needs. However, there is a combination of technologies which could make solar power a significant, reliable contributor to the World’s energy needs. But I doubt any green will rush to embrace it.
How do we make solar power reliable? The problems which make solar power unreliable are mainly related to weather – clouds, rain, snow, winter, poor air quality, anything which interrupts the flow of light reaching the collector.
The solution is to put the solar panels beyond the reach of all these problems – by putting them into orbit. Launching solar panels into orbit might sound far fetched, but it is being seriously considered by a number of national space programmes.
Space-based solar power (SBSP) is the concept of collecting solar power in space (using an “SPS”, that is, a “solar-power satellite” or a “satellite power system”) for use on Earth. It has been in research since the early 1970s.
SBSP would differ from current solar collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on Earth’s surface. Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere and night time in space.
Part of the solar energy (55–60%) is lost on its way through the atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses, and the downtime (and cosine losses, for fixed flat-plate collectors) due to the Earth’s rotation.
Besides the cost of implementing such a system, SBSP also introduces several new hurdles, primarily the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth’s surface for use. Since wires extending from Earth’s surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally include the use of some manner of wireless power transmission. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter, and focus its beam toward a collector (rectenna) on Earth’s surface. Radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become concerns for SBSP.
SBSP is considered a form of sustainable or green energy, renewable energy, and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals. It is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion (such as peak oil).
SBSP is being actively pursued by the Japan and China. In 2008 Japan passed its Basic Space Law which established Space Solar Power as a national goal and JAXA has a roadmap to commercial SBSP. In 2015 the China Academy for Space Technology (CAST) briefed their roadmap at the International Space Development Conference (ISDC) where they showcased their road map to a 1 GW commercial system in 2050 and unveiled a video and description of their design. A proposal for the United States to lead in Space Solar Power has recently received high level attention after it won the D3 (Diplomacy, Development, Defense) competition sponsored by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and USAID Director. As of May 21, 2015, there was an on Change.org and a second active petition at Whitehouse website.

The obstacle to space based solar power is obviously the launch cost. If you are paying thousands of dollars per kilogram for payload delivered into Earth orbit, launching thousands of tons of solar collector equipment is a sure route to a very expensive solar space station.
So how do we bring down the launch cost? There are a number of technologies on the drawing board, but lets stick with known technology, preferably a technology which has already been tested to some extent.
There is one cheap space launch technology which stands out – simple design, high thrust, high impulse, based on well understood engineering principles, capable of economically launching thousands, even millions of tons into any orbit you want, using a single stage launch vehicle. The only problem is the fallout.
Project Orion was a study of a spacecraft intended to be directly propelled by a series of explosions of atomic bombs behind the craft (nuclear pulse propulsion). Early versions of this vehicle were proposed to take off from the ground with significant associated nuclear fallout; later versions were presented for use only in space.
The idea of rocket propulsion by combustion of explosive substance was first proposed by Russian explosives expert Nikolai Kibalchich in 1881, and in 1891 similar ideas were developed independently by German engineer Hermann Ganswindt. General proposals of nuclear propulsion were first made by Stanislaw Ulam in 1946, and preliminary calculations were made by F. Reines and Ulam in a Los Alamos memorandum dated 1947. The actual project, initiated in 1958, was led by Ted Taylor at General Atomics and physicist Freeman Dyson, who at Taylor’s request took a year away from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton to work on the project.
The Orion concept offered high thrust and high specific impulse, or propellant efficiency, at the same time. The unprecedented extreme power requirements for doing so would be met by nuclear explosions, of such power relative to the vehicle’s mass as to be survived only by using external detonations without attempting to contain them in internal structures. As a qualitative comparison, traditional chemical rockets—such as the Saturn V that took the Apollo program to the Moon—produce high thrust with low specific impulse, whereas electric ion engines produce a small amount of thrust very efficiently. Orion would have offered performance greater than the most advanced conventional or nuclear rocket engines then under consideration. Supporters of Project Orion felt that it had potential for cheap interplanetary travel, but it lost political approval over concerns with fallout from its propulsion.

I doubt greens are going to rush to embrace a renewables solution which involves the release of atmospheric nuclear fallout, even if that fallout could be constrained to safe levels. But if the future viability of the planet was really at stake, and if nuclear power was unacceptable for whatever reason, solar power satellites could realistically and reliably deliver the energy our civilisation needs, with minimal carbon emissions, other than whatever was emitted during the construction of the components.

"Russia’s overreaction in prosecuting Greenpeace protesters, including the two journalists, is set to unfold into an international scandal that will seriously damage country’s global reputation. So far the situation is that 28 Greenpeace activists and two freelance photographers (one British, one Russian) will remain in custody in Murmansk for the next two months, on charges of piracy. The international reaction was muted at first. Despite worldwide public outrage, only the governments of Argentina and Ukraine voiced their protest. Finland, for example, while still opposing the charges of piracy, unofficially agrees the Finnish activist arrested (she was one of the few who actually made it onboard the platform) could serve her sentence at home. Yet to what extent Russia is willing to yield to international pressure remains open. Domestically, public opinion is split on the matter. The state-controlled media has conducted a defensive campaign against foreign influence in Russia or any interference in the vital oil and gas sector, an industry considered sacred under the current state capitalism regime. Last week Russian President Vladimir Putin called Sergei Medvedev, a professor at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, a moron after he suggested turning the Arctic into an international nature reserve to save it from corporate and state interests.  The scholar responded in a number of interviews, emphasising the idea that Russian national interests are much wider than those of Gazprom or any territorial ambitions. But not everyone sees it this way. A recent, state-run public opinion poll claimed around two-thirds of Russians support the state’s handling of the Greenpeace activists. Even some Russian environmental activists have criticised Greenpeace for being too “pro-Western”. They argue the organisation fails to involve Russians, leaving the country to play the role of the “aggressive” country in the Wild East. Another poll suggested Greenpeace’s stunt attracted the attention of only 1% of respondents, with other issues seen as being of greater importance. In fact the government’s line of accusing environmentalists of violating Russia’s sovereignty while trying to impose its capital interests abroad is somewhat new in the country. A similar action in Russia by Greenpeace last year provoked almost no official reaction – all activists were set free. Even in the recent crackdown on NGOs operating in Russia it was seldom environmental groups that suffered; human rights organisations are always first under fire. The president and government speak of the importance of environmental issues, yet whenever they conflict with economic issues, the former stand little chance of prevailing. But it was different this time. Shortly after the Arctic Sunrise was boarded, state-controlled media (mostly television) launched blunt, anti-environmentalist campaigns that accused the ecologists of piracy, violating Russia’s territorial independence, or restricting the rights of Russia to work in the Arctic. Such patriotic, often defensive, “everyone’s against Russia” opinions are not uncommon. According to various sources, diplomats are still trying to negotiate informally with Russia on the matter, but in the second week stronger steps have been taken. The Netherlands launched legal proceedings against Russia for unlawfully detaining Arctic Sunrise, a Dutch-flagged vessel. Other international organisations have begun issuing statements in support of the Greenpeace activists, among them the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum, and the European Parliament is expect to release a statement this week. To what extent can international criticism influence domestic Russian policy? Experts claim Russian officials may well ignore international opinion and launch yet another show trial. Similar in many respects to the Pussy Riot case, it sees a minor infraction answered with the full weight of the state-controlled legal system, once its “sacred interests” are hurt. This overreaction may in turn further fracture Russia’s already very fragile reputation and relationships abroad. On the other hand, it could prompt a more open discussion inside Russia, among experts and citizens – on the balance of environmental and economic policies, short-term vs long-term priorities, openness to criticism, the role of civil society, and the future of the Arctic and other refuges -  even a more engaged dialogue within Russia on its future and what governance people want in that future.

"It is time for Australian politicians to ditch the Emissions Trading Scheme and the whole expensive Global Warming fiasco.
The scientific case has collapsed, and the political coalition has evaporated, but still the major political parties continue to serve vested interests and fish for Green preferences.
The scientific case for action on global warming is essentially this: “Man’s emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are causing dangerous global warming”. This scare has been disproved in triplicate.

What on Earth is going on in Washington? The public believes less and less that human beings are responsible for global warming, surface temperature shows no net change in over a decade, and there’s still a bill about to be debated in the House that will require the average American in 2050 to have a “carbon footprint” no larger than it was for the average American in 1867.



The politics of global warming are becoming increasingly disconnected from the people. Day after day, hour after hour, telescreens shout, “Go Green! Go Green!” Fewer and fewer people care.



On April 19, Rasmussen Reports released a new global warming poll: 48 percent of respondents believe that observed climate changes are being “caused by planetary trends,” while 34 percent believe they are a result of human influence on the atmosphere. When Obama was sworn in, the relative numbers were 44 percent and 41 percent. Just three months ago, opinion was pretty much evenly split, and now there’s a whopping 14 percent plurality in favor of “natural causes.”





The politics of global warming are becoming increasingly disconnected from the people.



This is a change from bad to worse in the eyes of environmentalists. In January, Gallup found that, out of 20 prominent issues, Americans ranked global warming _dead last_ in terms of importance. If the newer Rasmussen results are any guide, support has waned even further since then.



If the political class would have done its homework, it would have seen this coming. The incessant hype has generated a massive political backlash. It was first documented over a year ago in the refereed journal _Risk Analysis_ , by Paul Kellstedt and two colleagues, political scientists at Texas A&M University.



The standard thinking is called the “knowledge deficit” model. That’s academese for the notion that the poor blokes aren’t concerned about global warming because they’re just stupid and haven’t heard enough about it. Obviously no one watches television any more (CNBC’s peacock is green this week), walks outside in major urban downtowns (plastered with billboards and posters — from energy companies — urging their customers to use less of their products), or goes to the movies ( _The Day After Tomorrow, An Inconvenient Truth, Ice Age: The Meltdown_ , etc).



Actually, people still do go to the movies, and watch TV, and are assaulted every urban minute with global‐​warming propaganda. And, according to Kellstedt, _the more people know about global warming, the less they care:_



Contrary to the assumptions underlying the knowledge‐​deficit model, as well as the marketing of movies like Ice Age or An Inconvenient Truth, the effects of information on both concern for global warming and responsibility for it are exactly the opposite of what were expected.



Jon Gertner touched on this in last Sunday’s _New York Times Magazine_. He noted that debate as to why climate change isn’t higher up on the priority totem‐​pole usually is blamed on “the doubt‐​sowing remarks of climate‐​change skeptics,” or “the poor communication skills of good scientists.”



This prism has bent the light on global warming exactly wrong. In fact, it is the communication skills of scientists that are responsible for people’s opinions. Kellstedt found that people “with high confidence in scientists … show less concern for global warming,” as did the “more informed respondents.” Americans’ lack of alarm has less to do with “skeptics” than it does with people’s perception of mainstream science.



Interestingly, this is parallel to other issues at the science‐​political nexus. Despite years of campaigning against genetically modified (GM) food on the part of many environmentalists, the more people learn, the less concerned they are about that, too.



Maybe this has to do with the fact that Americans have been consuming, in one form or another, GM food for decades, and we obviously aren’t dead yet. Sober scientists note that GM foods are nutritionally indistinguishable from their progenitors — so when someone else loudly and angrily foretells disaster upon disaster that will befall us from the use of GM products, people say “so what?” And when they see some movie about the horrors of global warming — if they know that scientists observe that the planet’s surface has been warming episodically and modestly for a century — they likewise say, “So what? It’s a _movie_.”



Washington would be well‐​advised to pay attention to what folks are telling pollsters out beyond the Beltway.



But it’s Earth Day, so I expect the response of the political class here will likewise be, “So what?”

It isn’t just climate change where we see blunders being made daily,  the mistakes made by some of history’s greatest scientists are often useful, and they learned from them (unlike some dogmatic climate scientists we can name).
Renowned astrophysicist Mario Livio explores and analyzes major errors committed by such luminaries as Charles Darwin, Linus Pauling, Fred Hoyle and Albert Einstein. During a live public lecture webcast on June 1, 2016, astrophysicist and author Dr. Mario Livio looked at major missteps made by some of history’s greatest scientists, and explained why blunders are actually an integral part of the scientific process.

"**The UK is in talks with allies about how to handle a potential ""exodus"" of people from Hong Kong, the foreign secretary has said.**
Dominic Raab told MPs ""burden sharing"" had been raised with countries in the Five Eyes alliance if China imposes a new security law on the territory.
The Five Eyes group includes the US, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.
Mr Raab pledged certain Hong Kong residents a ""path to citizenship"" in the UK if the new law is imposed.
Under the plan, more than 300,000 holders of British National (Overseas) passports would be able to spend 12 months in the UK without a visa.
A further 2.6m eligible for BNO status - which normally confers the right to visit the UK for six months visa-free - could get the additional rights if they apply.
China is facing mounting criticism over a planned security law for Hong Kong which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority.
In a statement to MPs, Mr Raab urged China to reconsider its plans which, he said, would threaten Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity.
""The sad reality is that if China continues down this track, it will strangle what has long been the jewel in the economic crown,"" he said.
""It is clear to me that China is putting politics, as it views it, ahead of economics.""
Earlier this week, seven former UK foreign secretaries urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to form a global alliance to co-ordinate a response to the China-Hong Kong crisis.
Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997.
As part of an agreement signed at the time, the former British colony enjoys some freedoms not seen in mainland China - and these are set out in a mini-constitution called the Basic Law.
BNO passports were granted to Hong Kong citizens born before the Chinese handover in 1997 and while they allow the holder some protection from the UK foreign service they do not give the right to live or work in Britain.
The Five Eyes group is an intelligence sharing alliance formed during the Cold War."

Looking at the map below you will see that New Zealand and Australia are in a strong position food-wise as a few countries start to stockpile food in response to the pandemic.



[…] Some governments are moving to secure domestic food supplies during the conoravirus pandemic.



 **Kazakhstan** , one of the world’s biggest shippers of **wheat flour** , banned exports of that product along with others, including carrots, sugar and potatoes. **Serbia** has stopped the flow of its **sunflower oil** and other goods. Russia is leaving the door open to shipment bans and said it’s assessing the situation weekly.



To be perfectly clear, there have been just a handful of moves and no sure signs that much more is on the horizon. Still, what’s been happening has raised a question: Is this the start of a wave of **food nationalism** that will further disrupt supply chains and trade flows?



[…] Though food supplies are ample, logistical hurdles are making it harder to get products where they need to be as the coronavirus unleashes unprecedented measures, panic [buying](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-13/americans-empty-nation-s-grocery-shelves-to-hunker-down-at-home) and the threat of labor crunches.



[…] The specter of more trade restrictions is stirring memories of how protectionism can often end up causing more harm than good. That adage rings especially true now as the moves would be driven by anxiety and not made in response to crop failures or other supply problems.



As it is, many governments have employed extreme measures, setting curfews and limits on crowds or even on people venturing out for anything but to acquire essentials. 



[…] **“You could see wartime rationing, price controls and domestic stockpiling,”**



Some nations are adding to their strategic reserves. China, the biggest rice grower and consumer, pledged to buy more than ever before from its domestic harvest, even though the government already holds massive stockpiles of rice and wheat, enough for one year of consumption.



As governments take nationalistic approaches, they risk disrupting an international system that has become increasingly interconnected in recent decades.



Kazakhstan had already stopped exports of other food staples, like buckwheat and onions, before the move this week to cut off wheat-flour shipments. That latest action was a much bigger step, with the potential to affect companies around the world that rely on the supplies to make bread.



There is no need for New Zealanders to panic. The farmers who have always been the [backbone of our economy](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/dear-jacinda-and-winston/) will get us through the pandemic. The pandemic has been a life lesson for those who valued tourism over our farmers. When the going gets tough the tourism dollar disappears but our farmers are the ones who will keep us all fed. I sincerely hope that our Green MPs take note of this life lesson and that they don’t return to their [farmer bashing ways.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/a-speech-from-the-farmers-wellington-protest-stop-the-attack-on-farmers/)



We all now know what a **real emergency** looks like and their pathetic climate change emergency should be put firmly into the dustbin of history where it belongs.

"The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has called for more action to be taken to address the climate crisis, which she says has slipped dangerously off the political agenda. Thunberg appeared by video link at the Venice film festival where the film, I Am Greta, has been screened. It documents her life as one of the most famous teenagers in the world after she became the figurehead for a global climate crisis campaign. She said: “Yes, we need more science. We need to do more research, definitely. But what we need above all is to take take action to change the social landscape, political action, so maybe that’s where I can be most useful.” Thunberg said that the Covid-19 crisis had shown that world leaders were incapable of dealing with two emergencies at once, and said that climate change should be treated with urgency. “All other things have had to be put on hold. We definitely need to realise the urgency of the climate crisis, and treat it as a crisis, because otherwise we will not be able to achieve real change,” she said. She went on to criticise world leaders, saying too much responsibility was being placed on children to raise awareness of the climate crisis. “We should not be the ones having to do this. It should be up to adults and people in power in those who have caused this problem in the first place.” During the making of the film, Thunberg was followed by documentary film-maker Nathan Grossman, who recorded her everyday life after she rose to fame for her climate activism. She said at times during the year-long process she thought Grossman’s one-man setup was “unprofessional” but, ultimately, she was pleased with the way he had portrayed her as a “shy nerd”. Thunberg added: “I think [Grossman] succeeded in framing me as myself and not the angry, naive child who sits in the United Nations General Assembly screaming at world leaders. Because that’s not the person I am.” The activist said there had been too much focus on her as an individual, and she hoped the film could be a “bridge” for people who wanted to know more about the climate emergency. She hoped the film would help to “increase momentum” and spread awareness at a time when protesting and activism have been reduced because of Covid-19 restrictions around the world. Thunberg added that it was symbolic to have the film screened in Venice, a city that suffered severe flooding in 2019 that its mayor blamed on climate change. The activist signed off from the press conference to go to school in Sweden. In August, Thunberg announced she was returning to the classroom after taking a year off to protest."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSolar activity impacts Pacific weather
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In a joint US-German study, seven scientists recently tried to discredit the sun’s impact on climate. On April 19, 2017, Guoyong Wen and colleagues published a modeling study in the Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate, which suggested a maximum solar-dependent share of 0.1°C on the temperature development over the past 400 years. Here the scientists relied on the old, well-known trick of using the Little Ice Age as the starting.
However, a really convincing test would be require including the the Medieval Warm Period, a time when temperatures were similar to those of today. The atmospheric CO2 concentration was low while solar activity was high. Once again a good opportunity got passed up.
Ignored here were the strong paleo-climatological indicators that the sun had significant involvement on the climate climate. At notrickszone Kenneth Richard presented an entire series of new studies. In September 2016, Andy May presented a nice overview of the thousand-year cycles over at WUWT.
Yet another interesting paper by Kovalenko & Zherebtsov, appeared in November 2014 at Springer-Journal ‘Atmospheric and Oceanic Optics‘:

Influence of solar activity on the climate change
We discuss problems which are of main importance for understanding the nature of climate changes in the 20th century and basic physical processes responsible for these changes. A possible role of solar activity in the Earth’s climate changes in the past and future is considered. As shown, physical mechanisms which can provide for the solar variability effect on the weather and climate are reduced to the control of the energy flux from the Earth to space. A special emphasis is given on the solar activity effect on climatic characteristics of the troposphere through the atmospheric electricity. We consider peculiarities of the response of thermal and dynamic regimes of the World Ocean and atmosphere to solar activity changes and processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere. We also show and discuss results of the analysis of regularities and peculiarities of troposphere and the ocean surface temperature response to both isolated heliogeophysical disturbances and long-term changes in solar and geomagnetic activity.”

El Nino appears irregularly every 2-7 years. In between there are the cooling La Nina phases. El Nino and La Nina are Pacific weather phenomena that make up in part the so-called ENSO, which is an indicator of the Pacific climate condition. A team of scientists led by Danish Hassan presented calculations in a paper in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics in January, 2016. The paper showed a solar influence on the ENSO, and thus a related climate-parameter:
Sunspots and ENSO relationship using Markov method
The various techniques have been used to confer the existence of significant relations between the number of Sunspots and different terrestrial climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dewdrops, aerosol and ENSO etc. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can explore the information about the related variables. This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables. This study can be useful to explore the influence of ENSO related local climatic variability.”

Thirty years ago, NASA scientist James Hansen put greenhouse-effect warming on the map with his strident testimony indicating that global temperatures could then confidently be related to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Two years ago, he made another prediction: several meters of sea level rise in this century. He told _Scientific American_ :   




Consequences [of climate change] include sea level rise of several meters, which we estimate would occur this century or at latest next century, if fossil fuel emissions continue at a high level. That would mean loss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s large cities and all their history.



There’s only one way to accomplish this: melt a substantial portion of Greenland’s ice. In fact, as early as 2004 he wrote Greenland could a substantial portion of its ice in 100 years with the warming of this century, causing a total sea level rise of nearly 20 feet.   
  
Fortunately, there are ways to test the hypothesis that Greenland is about to shed like a calico cat in the summer. It turns out Greenland has experienced multiple millennia of heat at times during the last 125,000 years.   




The last two million years or so have been punctuated by (at least) four major ice ages. The reigning theory is that they are driven by slight but predictable variations in earth’s orbit around the sun, as well as the opening of the circumpolar Southern Ocean and the rise of the Himalayas. Our orbit is an ellipse in which the relation to the sun changes over time. Right now, earth is closest to the sun in Northern Hemisphere winter, and furthest away in summer. Under some conditions, that would lead to an ice age, but the seasonal distances between earth and sun also precess with time, and our orbit is right now quite circular. That makes the winter-summer difference small, preventing another ice age.   
  
At the end of each of the last two ice ages, earth and sun lined up in a position where they are closest in Northern Hemisphere summer, and the orbit was highly elliptical, which means excess sunshine in the high latitudes, warming Greenland, and northern Eurasia and North America—a lot.   
  
The Arctic tundra holds many secrets, including the fact it was once forested. It’s now too cold for trees, but we also know how warm it has to be for trees to survive. Dying trees buried in highly acidic peat are preserved remarkably intact. Here, for example is a log, radiocarbon dated at 6,000 years old that looks like new wood:   






We became interested in this years ago, with the 2000 publication by Glen MacDonald, of UCLA, and several colleagues, showing that from roughly 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, “mean July temperatures along the northern coastline of Russia may have been 2.5° to 7.0°C [3.6° to 12.6°F] warmer than modern.” This is consistent with the 2016 finding of Jason Briner (University of Buffalo) that the difference between warmest and coldest postglacial millennia is 5.4° +/- 1.8°F in Arctic Canada and Greenland. Last year, dating buried wood and cones, Leif Kullman found high latitude summer temperatures at least 3.6°C [6.5°F] warmer than today, between roughly 6,500 years to 11,200 (!) years ago.   
  
What did all this mean for Greenland? According to a very recent paper by Lisbeth Nielsen of University of Copenhagen, all that warming melted enough ice to raise sea level between ~0.15-1.2m (0.5-4.0 ft) over several thousand years. That’s a far cry from Hansen’s 20 feet in a hundred years, and it’s telling that the 2016 Briner finding and Hansen’s forecast were concurrent.   
  
It’s also noteworthy that, due to all this arctic warming, “Arctic sea ice cover was strongly reduced during most of the early Holocene and there appear to have been periods of ice free summers in the central Arctic Ocean.” And yet this creature survived:   






All this recent research is consistent with a landmark 2013 paper by Dorthe Dahl-Jensen and several colleagues from the University of Copenhagen, who drilled a core through the Greenland ice to the beginning of the _previous_ interglacial--125,000 years ago, through the millennia known as the Eemian warmperiod.   
  
If one thinks it was warm at the beginning of the current interglacial, the beginning of the last one was sweltering at high northern latitudes, given the Dahl-Jensen data. It used to be thought that a 6,000 year period, centering around 118,000 years ago, was around 3.6-5.4°F (2-3°C) warmer in summer than the 20th century average for Greenland. But data in their core showed it averaged 10.4-14.0° (6-8°C) warmer in summer _for 6,000 years_. And for all of that, they estimate that Greenland lost about 30% of its ice, which would raise sea level about about 1.38 inches per _century_ over these six millennia. Not a Hansenian 20 feet, in a hundred years, but about 6/1000’s of that.   
  
Quantitatively, here’s why Hansen’s hypothesis is wrong.   
  
Assume that the six-millenia Eemian averaged around the lower level of Dahl-Jensen’s estimate, some 6°C warmer in summer. That means the melting heat-load (Greenland’s ice melts every summer) over Dahl-Jensen’s core region (northwestern Greenland) was:   
  
6000 summers X 6°C = 36,000 degree-summers.   
  
It’s doubtful we are going to warm our atmosphere with increased carbon dioxide for anywhere near 1,000 years, and climate models project a summer warming around Greenland in the top range of around 5°C. But let’s assume these pessimistic parameters.   
  
Although this is likely a huge exaggeration of the heat that humans could possibly unload on Greenland, it is   
  
1000 summers X 5°C = 5,000 degree-summers.   
  
Therefore, in a 1000-year worst-case scenario we will only melt a small fraction of Greenland’s ice, compared to the loss in the 6000-year Eemian.   
  
That’s a far, far cry from Jim Hansen’s 20 feet in 100 years. When his alarming sea-level rise hypothesis comes up (as it will) around the 30th anniversary of his 1988 testimony on June 23, rest assured that thousands of years of ice core data—real data instead of a speculative hypothesis—show the Greenland-driven disaster scenario to be simply untrue.   
  
Finally, we just published a critique of Hansen’s 1988 overall forecast in the June 22 _Wall Street Journal_.

"“Where are you going to find experienced lithium miners? That’s like finding unicorns,” laughs James Brown, the managing director of Western Australian resources firm Altura Mining. Brown is the next best thing. Hailing from a family five generations deep in coal mining, the burly Queenslander never imagined he’d be applying his expertise to digging out a key building block of a low-carbon economy. For a man not particularly fussed about the climate crisis, it’s an unlikely sector to have ended up in. But when it comes to lithium, the two factions of Australia’s climate wars have reached an uneasy truce. On the one side, environmentalists are engaging with a resources sector they distrust to nudge it towards lithium, an element which is used in batteries for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems due to its remarkably high energy density. On the other, miners like Brown are suppressing scepticism of green causes to carve out a future in a world aiming to divest itself of fossil fuels. Brown joined Altura Mining in 2009, and set about helping the small coal miner diversify into other resources as a way of hedging against headwinds facing the fossil fuel. Lithium, hyped as the “white gold” of the 21st century, seemed a promising investment. But securing investors for Altura’s exploration tenements in the remote ochre deserts of the Pilbara proved challenging. “What I didn’t realise was how difficult it would be to fund the project while remaining a coal miner,” Brown says. “Our fund manager said: ‘you guys owning both coal mines and lithium is like a health fund owning a tobacco company.’” And so lithium evolved from Altura Mining’s backup, to its main plan. Brown concedes the company still owns undeveloped coal assets, but he claims it is only because they’ve proved difficult to sell. Despite the urgency of the climate crisis, the attachment to coal runs deep for Australians like Brown, and leaving it behind wasn’t easy. His family connection to the fossil fuel stretches back at least to his great grandfather, who left the UK for Australia in the early 1900s during the turbulence of the coal strikes, when miners were fighting for the right to a minimum wage. The family moved to Ipswich, Queensland, where Brown’s grandfather was sent to work in the mines from the age of 13. The tradition continued with his father, who laboured for 40 years with local coal operator New Hope Group. Brown’s childhood memories are of miners’ picnics, playing for the Coalstars soccer team, and dreams of joining his father in the mines when he was old enough. The union made sure family members got a look in. When the time came, however, he was soundly rejected. Brown was left handed, but the equipment was designed for right handers. “As soon as they saw my watch on my right hand, nobody wanted me as an apprentice,” he says. Brown was still able to work in the sector as a cartographer, and then as a civil engineer at New Hope. Brown’s son also went on to become a mining engineer. All that experience has held Brown in good stead, with Altura Mining one of the few to transform Australia’s much-hyped lithium potential into commercial reality, in a sector littered with failed ventures. Australia leads the world in lithium production and possesses an estimated 6.3m tons of lithium reserves. The metal is fast becoming a geopolitical bargaining chip, as China, the US and other major powers jostle to secure access to an element expected to surge in demand as the global economy rapidly ramps up production of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems, not to mention lithium-ion mobile phone batteries. Lithium is abundant and even found in seawater, but at such low densities that commercial extraction is not yet feasible. As such, a handful of countries with extractable reserves in hard rock – like Australia – and in the brine of salt lakes are growing in geopolitical importance. The most common form of extraction in Australia is by crushing a hard rock called spodumene, and from that extracting lithium concentrate using a separation method that Brown says is similar to some coal processing systems. Harry Fisher, senior consultant at business intelligence company CRU Group, believes the economic recovery from Covid-19 will be the moment the long-promised lithium rush finally gets underway. “Governments continue to promote the merits of a ‘green recovery’, with EV subsidies being increased in Germany, France, UK and many others,” he says. “Policy is likely to continue to support demand.” Australia has no formal green recovery plan, but Fisher suggests that might not matter if the rest of the world does. Fisher forecasts that demand will grow to 830 kilotonnes by 2025, up from around 330 kilotonnes this year. In particular demand, Fisher says, is the spodumene that Australia specialises in. The Covid-19 shutdown has presented challenges, and with lithium yet to hit the heights projected, the sector is doing it tough. Altura Mining is currently restructuring its debt arrangements and has suspended shares from trading as it navigates the crisis. Despite the challenges, the company shipped a record 60,950 wet metric tonnes of spodumene concentrate for the June 2020 quarter. The lithium is mined at the company’s flagship Altura Lithium Project at Pilgangoora. Brown in June signed a five-year offtake agreement with a subsidiary of Ningbo Shanshan, one of the world’s major suppliers of battery components for electric vehicles and green energy storage. Altura will be a key supplier to Shanshan’s new lithium chemical plant in China, which plans to produce 25,000 tonnes per annum. The deal came, says Brown, thanks to China’s two-year extension of state subsidies and tax breaks for electric vehicles until the end of 2022. The subsidies were also cited by Pilbara Minerals, the operator of a neighbouring Pilgangoora lithium mine, as a reason for optimism. Australia’s major competition in the global market is the “lithium triangle” of Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, which extracts the metal out of the region’s salt lakes. This form of lithium mining has attracted criticism for drawing on water supplies in the region, encouraging companies such as BMW to point to use of Australian hard rock lithium in their electric vehicles to burnish their sustainability credentials. Elsa Dominish, research principal at the Institute for Sustainable Futures, said the environmental impact of lithium mining is similar to other forms of hard rock mining. She says Australia has an opportunity to establish the world’s best practice for lithium mining by monitoring water and energy use, management of waste, and impact on sacred cultural sites. Dominish emphasises that lithium’s footprint pales in comparison to the impact of coal. “In addition to emissions … coal mining is one of the most damaging forms of mining considering health and environmental impacts, particularly respiratory impacts from exposure to coal dust,” she says. Lithium doesn’t just offer a practical solution to carbon emissions; it also represents a political solution. The Australian Labor party has twisted itself into knots trying to appeal to both working class coal miner workers and progressive inner-city voters concerned about climate change. The party is looking to make the case for a just transition for miners into work with emerging metals like lithium. The Greens have similar ideas. When Adam Bandt assumed the Greens leadership in February, he immediately went to work spruiking a Green New Deal. Bandt had even planned to visit the Greenbushes Lithium Mine in south-west WA, the largest hard rock lithium operation in the world, to sell the message of transitioning coal miners into jobs in new energy metals. The trip was called off due to the Covid-19 crisis. Miners have long moved to where the resources are, and Queensland and New South Wales coal workers might need to relocate to the Pilbara for new lithium mining gigs. In the case of Greenbushes however, there is a coal mining community right on its doorstep. Unions and the Western Australian government are pushing for a planned Greenbushes expansion to employ coal workers from the nearby Collie mine and power plant, in a bid to secure a future for them as the local coal industry withers away. Industry analysts, lithium miners, and green groups also agree on something else: simply digging the lithium out of the ground and exporting it with minimal processing is a wasted opportunity. According to the Million Jobs Plan report, produced by climate thinktank Beyond Zero Emissions, Australia earns only 0.5% of the value of its exported lithium ore, with the remainder going to overseas companies that further refine it and manufacture lithium-ion batteries. South Australia, home to Tesla’s Big Battery, is developing battery manufacturing capacity, and BZE argues Western Australia could invest in lithium refinement, battery component manufacture, and recycling, to contribute towards 100,000 new jobs nationally by 2025. The state is already host to several processing facility projects. Heidi Lee, project lead for the Million Jobs Plan, says the Covid-19 shutdown is a generational opportunity for the Australian government to set signals to unlock investment, such as a new renewable energy target. “This is the moment we’re all sitting back, having to rethink what good looks like,” she says. “It’s not lithium for the sake of lithium mining, or processing for the sake of processing. It’s how these pieces all come together. So many parts need to move simultaneously to make this happen … the world has to move to all-electric [vehicles] to mitigate climate change, and that needs to happen quickly at scale.” In response to questions about how the federal government is supporting the sector, a spokesperson for the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources pointed to examples of general government support for resources that the lithium sector is eligible for, and the establishment of the Critical Minerals Facilitation Office and the Critical Minerals Portal. Investments include $20m in Cooperative Research Centre Projects funding towards critical minerals, and a $25m spend on the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre, which seeks to “optimise value creation in downstream mineral processing, battery manufacture, deployment, reuse and recycling”. Back at Altura Mining, Brown warns there are challenges in building up more of the lithium supply chain in Australia due to high energy and labor costs. He’d like to see the federal government help the sector access low-cost capital. “Australia has a habit of being just the raw material supplier, but if that’s the case we have to accept we’re buying the products back at a higher price,” he says. Brown might not be buzzing about his role in addressing the climate crisis, but he is excited about what lithium represents – in his own way. “Few people get the opportunity to be involved in new commodities,” he says, proudly. “That’s what we’re doing: we’ve gone from a rock chip sample to a mine. And it’s great to see that come to fruition.” The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the economy but also presented a unique opportunity: to invest in climate action that creates jobs and stimulates investment, before it’s too late. The Green Recovery features talk to people on the frontline of Australia’s potential green recovery."

Here are two iron-clad rules you should always keep handy in your Bullshit Detection Kit:



The first is a fundamental principle of science, as summed up by the Royal Society’s original motto, _Nullius in verba_ : **Take nobody’s word for it.** As the Royal Society explains, “verify all statements by an appeal to facts”. This doesn’t mean that you have to repeat every study for yourself, but the state of science journalism is as parlous as journalism generally. Bias and journalistic ignorance reign supreme: at the very least, **don’t believe the headlines**. Dig deeper, read the original study for yourself, if you can.



As for “fact-checkers”, from Snopes to Politifact, their record of bias, deceit and fake news is so amply demonstrated that they simply cannot be given any credence by anyone with an ounce of critical thinking ability.



Australia’s taxpayer-funded ABC “Fact-Checking Unit” is even worse than most. Australian politician **Craig Kelly** supplies the latest case-in-point.



When Kelly claimed, in a tv interview, that **“In the first 20 years of this century (2000-2019) we’ve had more rainfall in Australia than the first 20 years of last century”** , Australia’s taxpayer-funded leftist propaganda outfit [swung into action](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-06/fact-check-craig-kelly-rainfall-drought/12016214).



They ruled Kelly’s claim “flawed”.



 **Except that it is 100% true – as even their own data shows.**



This shows why the ABC should be sold off – as they can’t be trusted and are spreading disinformation[…]with the headline and ‘The Verdict’ ABC are not telling the truth.



MY CLAIM is 100% CORRECT – as evidenced by the data buried down in ABC FactCheck‘s report.



Contrary to ’The Verdict’ ABC Fact-Check admits;



‘’Data recorded by the bureau for Australia’s annual average rainfall supports Mr Kelly’s claim …



From 1900 to 1919, Australia’s average annual rainfall was 438mm, which is less than the recorded average (494mm) between 2000 and 2019.’’



They even produce a chart of Australia’s rainfall – showing an INCREASING trend in rainfall.



That should be game, set and match to Kelly – but these facts are inconvenient truth for Climate Change Mafia.



“Straw-manning” is the “fact-checker”s favourite gambit: ignore what their target **actually** said, and create a [straw-man](https://philosophyterms.com/straw-man-fallacy/), a perhaps similar but different claim, and “fact-check” that.



So ABC Fact-check then create a ‘strawman’, and Fact-Check something entirely different (to what I said) regarding the regional differences and the high degree of variability in Australia rainfall trends – despite the fact that I’d acknowledged ‘’regional variations across 120 years of data’.



Who cares about pesky facts? The ABC has a hysterical narrative to peddle.



Climate change is the single biggest challenge ever faced by humanity. We have absolutely no time to lose.



If you believe that, you’ll probably believe that the ABC’s “Fact Checking Unit” actually checks facts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper is out by Rodolfo G. Cionco and Willie W. H. Soon: “Short Term Orbital Forcing (STOF): A quasi-review and a reappraisal of realistic boundary conditions for climate modeling“.
It suggests that climate models have neglected to take surrounding astro-climatic parameters correctly into account, and thus their output results are likely even less reliable.

The abstract above states that the two authors found “important relative differences of up to +- 5%, which correspond to 2.5 W/sqm in the daily mean insolation“. They conclude: “this previously unrecognized error could have a significant impact in initial and boundary conditions for any climate modeling experiment.”
Willie Soon, a Harvard astrophysicist and skeptic of AGW science, wrote in an email:
To our best understanding, this new insolation calculation should supersede/replace the previous outputs provided by Berger & Loutre (1991) and Laskar et al. (2004) and their related publications especially since all these previous calculations/databases have not accounted for the modulating effects from STOF. “
The scientists summarize in the paper that the error “could spread and propagate with time especially when intra-annual insolation quantities are required” and that “the sensitivity of initial climate conditions to these differences should be addressed“.
In other words: it’s back (again) to the drawing board for the beleaguered climate modelers.

This week, a few major media outlets covered my take on the effectiveness and judiciousness of President Obama’s call, at the U.N. Climate Summit, for all countries of the world to make pledges of how and how much they are going to reduce their national carbon dioxide emissions. It should be no surprise that I think such actions would be ineffective and imprudent.   
  
My biggest criticism is that not all countries of the world are at the same stage of energy development. While the developed nations may have all the energy supplies they want and need, most developing countries do not. So, while developing countries pursue “luxuries” like indoor lighting and clean cooking facilities (not to mention improved sanitation), developed countries are awash in the luxury of debating whether to alter the relative components of their fuel mix in hopes that it may (or may not) alter the future course of the climate.   
  
Since historically (and today) there is an extremely tight coupling between energy production and carbon dioxide emissions (since fossil fuels are used to produce the overwhelming bulk of our energy), calls like those from President Obama to restrict carbon dioxide emissions are akin to calls to restrict energy usage and expansion.   
  
Imposing carbon restrictions on developing nations would have large-scale negative implications, not only to those directly affected, but to the world as a whole, as a large expanse of human ingenuity--arguably humanity’s greatest resource--would remain constrained by basic survival efforts and 50-year life expectancies.   
  
Basically, no one is going to go along with this. So despite promises, when adhering to plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (whether informal or formalized in a treaty) comes up against economic expansion and human welfare improvements, the latter are going to win out every time (or so we would hope).   




Consequently, it is a lot easier to ""talk the talk"" on this issue of cutting carbon dioxide emissions than it is to ""walk the walk."" Even in the United States, where carbon dioxide emissions have been on a gentle decline for the past 7-8 years (something that the President likes to take credit for, despite that being impossible), a substantial portion of that decline has come at the hand of the recession and the rather stagnant recovery.   
  
Some countries, however, are straightforward enough to publically recognize this and dispense with appearances. Take India for example. The new environmental minister there was forthright in a recent _New York Times_ article:   




In a blow to American hopes of reaching an international deal to fight global warming, India’s new environment minister said Wednesday that his country would not offer a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions ahead of a climate summit next year in Paris.   
  
The minister, Prakash Javadekar, said in an interview that his government’s first priority was to alleviate poverty and improve the nation’s economy, which he said would necessarily involve an increase in emissions through new coal-powered electricity and transportation. He placed responsibility for what scientists call a coming climate crisis on the United States, the world’s largest historic greenhouse gas polluter, and dismissed the idea that India would make cuts to carbon emissions.   
  
“What cuts?” Mr. Javadekar said. “That’s for more developed countries. The moral principle of historic responsibility cannot be washed away.” Mr. Javadekar was referring to an argument frequently made by developing economies — that developed economies, chiefly the United States, which spent the last century building their economies while pumping warming emissions into the atmosphere — bear the greatest responsibility for cutting pollution.



My guess is India is not alone in this sentiment, whether publically expressed or not.   
  
The bottom line is that the world needs more energy, not less. Humanity’s overall well-being will be tied to the success of such pursuit.   
  
Here’s is how I summed things up in my _USA Today_ op-ed:   




Overall, the world needs more energy, not less. Whatever changes in the climate that are to come, humanity will be better prepared and more resilient if we are healthier, wealthier and wiser. Restricting our ability to progress in these areas is not the best way forward.

Miscellaneous
At time of posting, all 5 monthly data sets were available through June 2016. The NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data runs 2 days behind real-time. Therefore, real data through July 29th is used, and the 30th and 31st are assumed to have the same anomaly as the 29th.
The July projections for HadCRUT4 and GISS and NCEI and UAH are higher than the June projections were. This is due to the fact that global NCEP/NCAR anomaly rose from +0.369 in June to +0.409 in July. The UAH-specific NCEP/NCAR anomaly (83.75°N to 83.75°S) went from +0.369 in June to +0.412 in July. The RSS-specific anomaly (81.25°N to 68.75°S) was down slightly, going from +0.436 in June to +0.407 in July. July will be the 12th consecutive month that has seen a record high monthly value set for the global anomaly (90°N to 90°S) for that calendar month. NCEP/NCAR re-analysis data goes back to the beginning of 1948.
* I got lucky with the UAH prediction for June. Due to a wrong entry in my spreadsheet, the projection was +0.302. It should’ve been +0.277, so I caught a break there.

"Look at these two quotes:
Kevin Rudd at the Lowy Institute on November 6:
“The overwhelming need for Australia to tackle the great challenge of our generation is being frustrated by the do-nothing climate change sceptics. My message to the climate change sceptics, to the big betters and the big risk-takers, is this: You are betting our children’s future and the future of our grandchildren.”
Malcolm Turnbull on ABC radio’s AM, 27 Nov 09:
“This is not a game. We are talking about the future of our children and their children, we’re talking about the future of our planet. The vast majority of Australians want to see action on climate change. The issue boils down in the mind of the Australian people, which party can we trust to take effective action on climate change?”
Turnbull has already used trickery to frustrate the majority in the party room who wanted to at least delay the Ration-N-Tax Scheme.
Now Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull have devised a another tricky plan to get the CPRS Bill through the Senate on Monday 30th November, the day before the Liberal party meeting he has called for Tuesday, where he is expected to be blasted out of office.
The plan is to move the guillotine in the Senate on Monday where the ALP’s 32 senators will be supported by Turnbullite Liberal senators in sufficient numbers to pass the guillotine. Once that has been done the CPRS Bill will be immediately put to the vote, and the same coalition of ALP and Turnbullite senators will pass the Bill.
This is indeed a cunning plan and demonstrates the length of trickery to which Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull are prepared to go together to impose this monstrous regime of command and control on Australia.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
I watched the new Leonardo DiCaprio climate epic so you don’t have to. The following 5 minute summary will save you an hour and a half of your life which you will otherwise never get back.

Quite apart from DiCaprio racking up an impressive number of air miles, in my opinion the video contained nothing new or exciting. The scariest moment was President Obama insisting that the Paris agreement is only the beginning of the pain, but we kind of knew that anyway.
Dated content, tired rehashed conspiracies. The most likely prognosis is a rapid one way journey to the digital graveyard.

“I have said it before, and I will say it again: the same political or journalistic treatment applied to any episode of seasonal flu would terrify us just as much as the current epidemic. Just as the staging – with real-time counts of victims – of any major health problem would make us shudder with fright just as much, if not infinitely more!”



  
 **Jean-Dominique Michel, Geneva, Switzerland.**



As New Zealand’s state of house arrest moved towards the end of week two, more [information](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wuhan-coronavirus-research-studies-published-2020-1) emerged about COVID-19. In spite of wall-to-wall news coverage of the disease as it rages around the world, it turns out that in the absence of pre-existing pathologies it is relatively benign.



A new [study](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/03/99-percent-of-italian-covid-19-deaths-had-health-issues.html) from Italy’s health officials confirms this. It shows that more than 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths involved older people with pre-existing medical illnesses. The average age of those patients was 79.5 years and almost half had three or more chronic pathologies.



In other words, for the majority of infected people, the disease is so mild that many don’t even know they have it. Most who develop symptoms, find it’s not too different from the flu.



However, for the group that’s known to be at risk, namely the elderly and those with pe-existing medical conditions, it can be extremely serious, even deadly. While there are also isolated cases of younger people who have succumbed to the disease, their numbers remain relatively small.



This information challenges the need for a country-wide lockdown, since those most at risk from COVID-19 are a relatively small and readily identifiable group. If they remained in self-isolation until a vaccine is available – or until the country develops widespread ‘herd’ immunity – with stringent social distancing and good hygiene, as well as effective testing and case management, surely there’s no reason why the country shouldn’t be able to return to some semblance of normality.



Although reports are now showing increasing success in treating serious cases of the disease with anti-viral agents such as [chloroquine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7F1cnWup9M) – and in preventing unnecessary deaths through the timely diagnosis and treatment of cytokine storm [syndrome](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-cytokine-storm-immune-system.html) – opening up the country would require the Government to be effective in preventing the spread of the virus.



Yet the latest news reports highlighting how people still cannot get tested, how frontline health workers still cannot access protective equipment, and how officials are still in denial over the benefits of facemask protection for the public – see [HERE](https://breakingviewsnz.blogspot.com/2020/04/muriel-newman-facemasks-for-public.html), continue to cast doubts on the Government’s capability in that regard.



Furthermore, since COVID-19 is an imported disease, questions are being asked about why our border controls haven’t been tighter?



The island nation of Taiwan – a country of almost 24 million people located just off mainland China – took control of its borders almost as soon as the epidemic emerged. They ensured anyone infected was isolated and heavily monitored. All citizens were required to wear face masks in public to prevent the spread of the disease. Temperature screening was also widely used to identify anyone displaying early symptoms who needed testing. As a result of these measures, the country has recorded only 376 cases and five deaths. **A lockdown was not needed.**



With the virus now spread widely around the world, everyone arriving in New Zealand from overseas should be quarantined.



At present, only symptomatic arrivals are quarantined for 14 days. Those without a self-isolation plan are placed in an isolation facility, but everyone else can travel to their place of residence to undertake self-isolation there.



Since mid-March, when the Prime Minister announced that border controls had been tightened, we were led to believe that all returning travellers going into self-isolation were being monitored. It now turns out they weren’t. For weeks travellers in so-called self-isolation have been visiting supermarkets and other public places potentially transmitting the virus.



It’s only in the last few days, that the Police have told us they have finally put in place a monitoring system that works.



The reality is that most of the jurisdictions that have successfully contained COVID-19 have isolated those carrying the virus. Instead, our Government sends them home, and as a result, other family members are being infected. That’s one of the main reasons why the number of cases has risen to over 1,200 and why the ‘cluster’ outbreaks have continued to grow.



It’s not as if there’s a shortage of isolation facilities either – every community will have motels or hotels that could be used for the purpose of housing those with COVID-19 until they test negative and have developed immunity. There’s also no shortage of campervans, should they be required. 



On March 23rd when the Prime Minister announced she was ordering the country into a lockdown, New Zealand had only 102 recorded cases of COVID-19. This raises the question of why the Government wasn’t able to get on top of the spread, without needing to close down the economy.



Those countries that have successfully contained the disease – namely Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and China – have all shown what needs to be done: comprehensive testing and tracking, the isolation of known cases, effective social distancing, good hygiene – including the wearing of face masks in public, and self-isolation for at-risk groups.



 **Had these measures been put in place by our Government, the spread of COVID-19 could have been controlled without shutting down the country.**



The effects of the lockdown are evident in a new [survey](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/third-businesses-fear-permanent-closure-during-covid-19-crisis) of 1,000 Auckland businesses. Over a third believe they will not survive the four week lockdown and will be forced to close permanently. Not only will there be massive job losses, but the impact on those who’ve spent years struggling to build their businesses, only to find them being destroyed by Government policy, will be devastating. Economists [warn](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/120843588/curve-flattening-and-lockdown-must-succeed-to-make-economic-price-worthwhile-asb) there will be “higher rates of suicide, heart attacks, strokes and long-term health problems as a consequence of the pressure being faced now” – not to mention when “the Government eventually tightens the reins, to repay the costs of the current rescue package”.



And what about the impact of the shutdown on those who are seriously ill, whose hospital treatment has been [cancelled](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120820546/coronavirus-urgent-surgeries-scans-cancelled-as-covid19-empties-hospitals)? Will the Government’s obsession with being seen to be saving the country from this disease end up killing New Zealanders who could otherwise have been saved?



There’re also concerns about the potential for COVID-19 to spread through public hospitals. It’s why countries that have successfully contained the disease, treat those infected in isolation hospitals, allowing public hospitals to continue treating their other patients.



The offer of help from the private hospital sector should have been accepted from the beginning. The thankfully small number of COVID-19 patients that have so far needed hospital care could have been accommodated in their facilities. That would have avoided the present situation where front line public hospital staff and patients have already had to go into isolation as a result of cross-infection with COVID-19 patients. 



The lockdown provisions that have effectively put us all under house arrest, are quite extraordinary for an outdoors loving nation.



While most New Zealanders have accepted the situation without question, the Prime Minister’s call for people to ‘dob in’ their neighbours on one hand, while telling us “be kind” to each other on the other, is of particular concern. Turning the population on itself during a crisis is fundamentally damaging Kiwi democracy.



With signs that public tolerance is now wearing thin – more so when a government Minister (of Health no less) flouts the rules being forced onto others – more people are now expressing the view that this Government is out of its depth.



The shock closure last week of Bauer Media, publisher of many much-loved magazine titles such as the New Zealand Listener, Woman’s Day, New Zealand Woman’s Weekly, North and South and Next, is a case in point. Jacinda Ardern responded to the news by saying, “I am extraordinarily disappointed and frankly gutted to see, what has been a part of New Zealand history, close its doors fairly abruptly today.”



She blamed the closure and loss of 230 jobs on the company for not accessing the Government’s business support package. But what the PM failed to acknowledge is that it was her mindless decision to ban magazines from supermarkets that triggered Bauer to close the doors.



The Magazine Publishers Association revealed it had worked closely with them and other publishers to try to convince the government to reverse their ‘non-essential’ ruling, pointing out that magazines have tightly controlled supply chains and are not a safety risk. 



But their appeals fell on deaf ears and small minds. The industry claims that magazines are the only media format now banned from operating during the lockdown and the only product banned from supermarkets.



Such we-know-best Government madness is intolerable, especially when magazines should have been available to help millions of families endure this prolonged period of forced home detention.



There’ve been many stuff-ups.



The Warehouse was told it could trade, then it couldn’t. Now it can – but only online for state-‘approved’ goods.



Butcher shops understood they could open, then they couldn’t. Then, after the pork industry revealed millions of pigs would have to be slaughtered, they were told they could open after all to process pork – but not sell it – except to supermarkets. Now, after millions of tons of meat has been destroyed, butchers have been told they can open and sell to the public – but only on-line.



Vegetable, fruit and flowers growers have also been forced to destroy their produce even though they assured the government they could produce their goods for market safely.



They are now amongst the hundreds of thousands of businesses throughout the country that are watching their losses mount as their life’s work slowly but surely ebbs away.



Meanwhile, under state orders, Kiwis patiently wait for food in lines reminiscent of the bread queues of the Soviet Union.



During the lockdown, Parliament’s Epidemic Response Committee has been meeting to scrutinise the Government’s actions. Chaired by the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Bridges, their meetings are live-streamed on Parliament’s [website](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/scl/epidemic-response/news-archive/watch-public-meetings-of-the-epidemic-response-committee/) on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9 am.



The former Vice-Chancellor of Otago University, renowned epidemiologist Professor **Sir David Skegg** , addressed last Tuesday’s meeting, suggesting that Singapore has managed the epidemic well (the NZCPR outlined their plan [HERE](https://www.nzcpr.com/why-singapores-coronavirus-response-worked-and-what-we-can-all-learn/)). He was critical of governments that rely too heavily on modelling: “There’s a limited role for mathematical modelling, but I’m worried that some are dazzled by the maths and don’t realise how uncertain the estimates are.”



We all know from the Armageddon projections of climate change that have been thrust upon us over the years, how modelling is sometimes used to frighten the public. 



Bizarrely, the government commissioned Otago University to [produce](https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/report_for_chief_science_advisor_-_health_-_24_march_final.pdf) a ‘worst case’ scenario about the virus infection that was so far-fetched it predicted doctors and nurses could strike in the midst of a COVID-19 health crisis: “In other worse case scenarios hospital staff could go on strike…” 



The university’s scaremongering, which claimed that without the lockdown there could be up to 27,600 deaths, was released by the Government in time for it to [lead](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/new-modelling-shows-thousands-could-die-if-covid-19-eradication-plan-fails) the six o’clock news.



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, Medical Anthropologist **Jean-Dominique Michel** , a public health expert from Geneva in Switzerland, is scathing about exaggerated modelling and governments that rely on it:



“Most projections aimed at imagining the number of possible deaths are nothing short of madness. Many rest on an artificial, maximal ‘forcing’ of all values and coefficients. They are established by people who work in offices, in front of computers, and do not have the slightest idea of the real world of field work or of clinical infectiology, resulting in absurd fictions.



“We might credit them with being creative and producing science fiction, but unfortunately their projections cause massive damage.



“I appeal to my colleagues in the Faculty of Medicine and other academic institutes to stop producing and peddling false, anxiety-provoking models. These experts protect themselves by recognizing the excessive nature of their formalizations, while journalists scrupulously mention it (to their credit), but they are nevertheless just as diligently constructing the impression that the world is coming to an end. Not only is there absolutely no reason for this, but in addition, it is in itself profoundly harmful!



“The reality, once again, is that this epidemic is far less problematic and dangerous than what is claimed. It is the lack of an accurate policy that is hazardous.”



With all of the indecision, contradictions, and failure to follow the lead of countries that have controlled the virus without destroying their economies, one can’t help but feel our leaders are making this crisis deeper than was necessary.

"Viscount Monckton of Brenchley (Christopher Lord Monckton) has agreed to come on a lecture tour in Australia in late January 2010.  Professor Ian Plimer will accompany Christopher Monckton on a whirlwind tour of the mainland capital cities starting in Sydney on January 25th and finishing in Perth on February 9th.  Unfortunately we cannot fit in Tasmania and the Northern Territory.  Lady Juliet Monckton will come as well, in part to monitor Lord Monckton’s health.
Prof. Plimer says the following of Lord Monckton: “although I modestly state that I am a good performer, he is superb and I have seen him fielding a very hostile BBC and other networks.  He has the ability to change thinking…”.
Given the now generally-acknowledged lack of understanding among the Australian general public of the underlying reasons for a “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme” and the likely effects thereof, it is critical that the public gets a chance to hear a globally-recognised presenter to explain the rational understanding of the whole issue.  Lord Monckton is the ideal person to carry out this task and to also put it to the mass media.
There are still details to be finalised for the tour, but basically the program for Lord Monckton’s public lectures is:
Note: Additional meetings Perth (9th Feb), Sydney (12th Feb); see http://carbon-sense.com/2010/02/06/monckton-extra-lectures/

Sydney January 27th, Sheraton on the Park, 5:30 pm
Sydney February 12th, Hilton Hotel, 12:20 pm
Newcastle January 28th, Banquet Room, City Hall, 12:30 pm
Brisbane January 29th, Irish Club, 3:00 pm
Noosa January 30th, The J , 2:00 pm
Melbourne February 1st, Sofitel Hotel, 5:30 pm
Canberra Feb. 3rd, National Press Club of Australia (details below)
Adelaide Feb. 4th, Intercontinental Hotel, 7:30 pm
Perth Feb. 8th, Parmelia Hilton, 5:30 pm
Perth Feb. 9th, Wesfarmers Lecture Theatre, 6:00 pm

The response to this tour has been amazing which underlines the timeliness of it.  We would stress that it would be good to get as many “agnostics” and “true believers” along to Monckton’s lectures.  So if you have any such friends, please persuade them to come along.
Seeing we had not enough time to have tickets printed and sold, admission to each event will be by a donation of $20 at the door ($10 in Perth).
As you can understand, the cost of this exercise will be very substantial and if you have not as yet made a donation and wish to do so, your donations should be directed to:

"Climate change is often seen as a recent phenomenon, but its roots are actually far older - the effects of human activity on the global climate have been discussed for more than 150 years. In the 1820s, the French mathematician Joseph Fourier was trying to understand the various factors that affect Earth’s temperature. But he found a problem – according to his calculations, the Earth should have been a ball of ice.  The most obvious factor, the Sun, did not seem to provide enough energy to raise the temperature of Earth above freezing. Fourier’s initial ideas, that there must be additional energy coming from the Earth’s core or from the temperature of outer space, were soon dismissed. Fourier then realised that the atmosphere, which at first seemed transparent, could be playing a crucial role. Then, in 1861, the Irish physicist John Tyndall performed an experiment which changed our view of the atmosphere. Tyndall demonstrated that gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorbed infrared radiation, and could trap heat within the atmosphere. He immediately realised the implications and remarked that these gases “would produce great effects on the terrestrial rays and produce corresponding changes of climate.”  Although this discovery would have profound consequences for understanding future climate, Tyndall, like most of his colleagues, was primarily interested in understanding the causes of ice ages, which had been discovered in 1837 by Louis Agassiz. What was missing however was an estimate of how much these gases could warm or cool the planet. Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, provided the first numerical estimates of “climate sensitivity” – defined as the temperature change corresponding to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He suggested a value around 4°C in 1896. While the scientists continued to debate the causes of the ice ages, the Earth was warming. From the 1920s onwards meteorologists began to realise that the climate of various regions had changed. Joseph Kincer suggested in 1933 that temperatures in individual cities had been rising. At the same time, others had started measuring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But it took an amateur meteorologist to put the puzzle together. Guy Stewart Callendar was a steam engineer who was fascinated by the weather. He meticulously collected temperature records from around the world, examined the carbon dioxide measurements and studied the work of Arrhenius and others. In his spare time, and without the aid of a computer, he performed the tedious calculations required to measure the temperature of the planet. These efforts produced the first evidence that Earth’s surface was warming. Exactly 75 years ago, in 1938, Callendar delivered his analysis to the Fellows of the Royal Meteorological Society. He revealed evidence for a 0.3°C rise in global temperatures over the previous 50 years and suggested that this was largely due to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning. His findings were found to be interesting, but were not viewed as conclusive by the esteemed Fellows.  Undeterred, Callendar continued his research, gathering additional evidence. In later years he published the first estimates of the change in carbon dioxide over time, prompting Charles Keeling to set up the first dedicated observatory for measuring gases in the atmosphere.  In 1961, Callendar updated his estimates for global temperatures with more observations, and these agree remarkably well with our current understanding. Callendar also felt that a warmer climate would be beneficial as it would “delay the return of the deadly glaciers” and allow crops to be grown at higher latitudes.  In the 75 years since Callendar’s discovery that carbon dioxide was warming the planet, much more has been learnt about the climate. But the basic picture has not changed. We are now more confident than ever of the role of human activity on global temperatures. We also have a more complete understanding of the consequences of a warmer planet. With all the attention on the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report in 2013, the considerable efforts of Callendar and his contemporaries in advancing our understanding of the climate should not be forgotten."

CLIMATE ANXIETY COUNSELING
I’m scared for the effects of climate change on the world I love. Rather than try to think about, save, or mourn for the whole world, I decided to think about my city and state, and the living creatures — including other humans — who share it with me.
The first round of Climate Anxiety Counseling ran in Kennedy Plaza (outside Burnside Park), Tuesday-Friday 3-6 pm, Saturday 3-5 pm, May 13th-June 7th, 2014. Opposite the bus terminal, and just outside Burnside Park, I sat with a Lucy-from-Peanuts style booth (thank you, Charles Schulz):
When people stopped to talk with me, I asked them what they were most worried about — whether it was related to climate change or to something else — and if I could write down what they said. With permission, I’ve shared on this site some of what people said to me.
If you come to the booth, you can share your anxiety–climate or otherwise–with me, and respond to someone else’s anxiety in the form of an Alternate History, to help imagine a different set of futures (more about how and why here). You can also take away a little drawing of a living creature that shares the state with you. I’ve since set up the booth at AS220’s Foo Fest, the Washington County Fair, the Sankofa World Market, and the Providence International Art Festival.

I had to laugh at the “Pictures taken without permission” reference. She sets up in a public place, where photography of anything in public view is fair game, yet still thinks people need to ask permission to take photos of her stunt. Epic fail.
My anxiety about climate used to be essentially zero, but now extends to the fact that there are people like this who are so sure of themselves that they can say “let’s take care of each other” in their masthead, while at the same time use the pejorative “climate deniers” to label people. I guess the take care thing is selective based on belief.
It reminds me of a certain religion, where being publicly chastised for putting your religion on display is not only expected, it is part of the process of ascension in the ranks. On the plus side, I think we have a candidate for somebody even further “out there” than “Slandering Sou” aka Miriam O’Brien.

Our “dear leader” Jacinda Ardern tells us the restrictions she put in place to control coronavirus are the strongest in the world, a statement which only goes to show how unaware she is of the [constraints other countries have implemented.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/pms-claims-about-nz-coronavirus-restrictions-are-pure-hyperbole/) Some are more far-reaching than ours. Hers was nothing more than an assertion designed to hopefully make global headlines. I am aware of some here on _The_ _BFD_ who support her actions, feeling this is a necessary attempt to stem the spread of the virus. There are others who say it’s too little to late and some think it’s OTT. Whatever your feelings are, it is the reality that matters.



So what is the reality? For a start, some people calling Healthline are waiting up to three hours to get through and then are getting disconnected. According to an article on _Stuff_ you might either get an automated message or simply be told to call back. There is little point in telling people to call Healthline if there are not enough staff to man the phones. 



Previously the prime minister said that at the airport, customs-like forms would be filled out and then handed to airport nurses who would then talk passengers through the process of self-isolation. One passenger said all he did was fill in a form giving his address and he was free to go, no questions asked and nothing explained. Some people were even joking about not complying.



Then we read that travellers who can’t convince border officials they have adequate plans for self-isolation could be sent home. The reality appears to be that if you scribble any old address on a piece of paper you’re on your way. Healthline will do a spot check to see if you are at the address and complying. If you’re not there no one knows where you are. End of story. If you are there and not complying, I’m not sure how they will know of your non-compliance. I assume Mr Plod will be sent along to guard your place of abode. What an horrendous waste of police time and manpower. Honestly, this is the stuff of comedy. Healthline by the sounds of it are so bogged down with incoming calls that **spot checks are the stuff of fantasy.** In reality that’s exactly what they are.



Having banned all events likely to attract over five hundred people the prime minister is turning her sights on weddings and funerals. How are these numbers going to be policed? Will Mr Plod be at the gate or church door counting the numbers of attendees? **This is seriously becoming farcical.** As with climate change the frighteners are being put on the younger generation who appear not to be able to cope with much at all. Some are stressing about death and what might happen to their grandparents.



This Government needs a dose of reality itself. It appears, after weeks of doing nothing, to have gone all-in, never mind the consequences. And the consequences are huge in all manner of ways. Having created the situation my pick is they’ll now be at a loss as to how to manage it. Their economic management has already proven to be woeful. If you’re going to have restrictions they at least have to be workable with sufficient personnel in place to ensure they achieve their aims.



Here’s the real reality. The number of deaths globally from this virus will pale in comparison to the numbers who have died from the ordinary flu this year. And there’s a vaccine for that.



I say, keep calm and carry on.

"**Hong Kong needs a controversial new security law to tackle ""growing terrorism"", the territory's security chief has said.**
John Lee said the city had become ""shrouded in the shadow of violence"".
After months of quiet, this weekend saw a fresh surge of protest after the government in Beijing proposed a security law that would radically change Hong Kong's unique status.
Opponents say it is a direct attempt to limit freedoms and silence critics.
Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has offered her support to Hong Kong residents, warning Beijing against using, as she put it, bullets and repression in the semi-autonomous territory.
Relations between China and Taiwan are already tense, because Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province, but many Taiwanese want a separate nation.
Meanwhile, the UK home secretary is being urged to review the status of the more than 300,000 Hong Kong residents who hold British National (overseas) passports but have no right to live or work in the UK.
A British government spokesman said the best solution would be for China to respect fully the rights and freedoms that were set out in the Sino-British joint declaration, agreed in 1997 when control of Hong Kong was handed from the UK to Beijing.
The bill was put forward on Thursday as China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), met for its delayed annual gathering.
China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, said the legislation - which would ban ""treason, secession, sedition and subversion"" - should be brought in ""without the slightest delay"".
On Sunday, thousands of people defied government warnings and marched through the city centre to protest against the bill.
Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators, who were wearing face masks to protect against the spread of coronavirus. There were at least 180 arrests.
In a statement on Monday, Mr Lee said that in the past year, ""the violence in Hong Kong has been escalating, with many cases involving explosives and genuine firearms"".
""Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as 'Hong Kong independence', become more rampant.""
He said the clashes on Sunday showed ""the need and urgency of the decision to be deliberated by the NPC"" and that the law would ensure Hong Kong's ""long-term prosperity and stability"".
Commissioner of Police Chris Tang also welcomed the bill, saying weapons and explosives seized from protesters showed Hong Kong was ""at the risk point of national security and there is a need to take effective measures to prevent the situation from deteriorating"".
Under Hong Kong's Basic Law - the mini constitution in place since it went back under Chinese rule in 1997 - it largely has responsibility for its own internal affairs and security.
But the ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - includes an article that says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security.
It adds: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law.""
That means China could potentially have its own law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong, alongside the city's own.
A group of 200 senior politicians from around the world have issued a joint statement criticising China's plan.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also condemned the plans, describing them as a ""death knell"" for the city's freedoms. The UK, Australia and Canada have also expressed their ""deep concern""."

Solar Activity To Climate Changes

Earlier this month, the first installment in the accumulating list of hundreds of new peer-reviewed scientific papers supporting a skeptical position on climate change alarm was made available.
Included on the list were 38 papers linking climate changes to solar forcing: 38 Sun-Climate Scientific Papers, January-March 2017
Just in the last few weeks alone, another 20 scientific papers were identified which link solar variations to climate changes, which means 58 papers have already been published in 2017.

20 New Sun-Climate Papers

High Solar Activity (Warming), High Crop Yields – Low Solar Activity (Cooling), Low Crop Yields


Huhtamaa and Helama, 2017


“Throughout the written history of Finland, delayed onset of summer and night frost have been named as the main reasons for crop failure and famine. … Our reconstruction suggests that in the 8th–10th centuries AD, when continuous crop cultivation was established in Finland, the risk of temperature-driven crop failure was notably lower and the crops were generally higher than during the historical period (c. 13th century ad onwards). The continuous period of high crop yields coincides with an episode of multi-centennial summer season warmth, associated with the MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly] in the region and around north-west Europe (Goosse et al., 2012; Luoto and Helama, 2010; Ogilvie et al., 2000; Sundqvist et al., 2010). The warm climatic regime of the MCA was interrupted by a period of distinctly cold winter and summer temperatures c. ad 1110– 1150 (Helama et al., 2009b; Linderholm et al., 2015; Tiljander et al., 2003). Also on the eastern side of the study area, in North-West Russia, c. ad 950–1100 was marked by a warmer climate and intensive agricultural expansion to the north (Klimenko, 2016).”
“The rapid mid-15th century cooling, which followed a major atmospheric circulation change over the North Atlantic (Dawson et al., 2007; Meeker and Mayewski, 2002) and coincided with the culmination of the Spörer solar minimum (Miyahara et al., 2006), has been evidenced in various summer and winter season reconstructions of the region (Haltia-Hovi et al., 2007; Helama et al., 2009b; Klimenko and Solomina, 2010; Luoto and Helama, 2010; Zhang et al., 2015).”
“The culmination of the ‘LIA’ [Little Ice Age] in Finland has been commonly dated to the late 17th and early 18th centuries ad (Luoto, 2013; Luoto and Helama, 2010; Tiljander et al., 2003), which is synchronous with the onset of the phase of the lowest yield ratios in our reconstruction. The Maunder solar minima (c. 1645–1715) and several volcanic eruptions preceded the culmination (Shindell et al., 2003).”

Decadal Variations In Ozone, ENSO, NAO, Mean Sea Level, And Climate ‘Excited By Solar Activity’

2. Chapanov et al., 2017
DECADAL CYCLES OF EARTH ROTATION, MEAN SEA LEVEL AND CLIMATE, 
EXCITED BY SOLAR ACTIVITY

“But recently, another mechanism of climate variations, due to cosmic rays was proposed (Kilifarska and Haight, 2005; Kilifarska, 2008, 2011; Velinov et al., 2005). According to the new models, the cosmic rays produce a ionization of the atmosphere, changes of atmosphere conductivity, lightning, and an increase of ozone concentration. The ozone plays significant role in climate variations, so the new models of cosmic ray influences on Earth atmosphere may explain the observed correlation between cosmic rays and climate variations.”
“The shape of solar cycles is rather different from sinusoidal form, so they affect geosystems by many short-term harmonics. A possible solar origin of decadal variations of Earth rotation, mean sea level and climate indices is investigated by the harmonics of Jose, de Vries and Suess cycles with centennial periods of 178.7, 208 and 231 years. The common decadal cycles of solar-terrestrial influences are investigated by long time series of Length of Day (LOD), Mean Sea Level (MSL) variations at Stockholm, ElNiño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), temperature and precipitation over Eastern Europe, Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), Wolf’s Numbers Wn and North-South solar asymmetry. A good agreement exists between the decadal cycles of LOD [length of day], MSL [mean sea level], climate and solar indices whose periods are between 12-13, 14-16, 16-18 and 28-33 years.”
“The Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), Wolf’s Numbers (Wn) and North-South (N-S) solar asymmetry expose different spectral peaks, amplitude modulation and phases from these bands. These solar time series represent thermal heating over the Earth, solar wind (space weather) and solar magnetic field variations. The decadal cycles of N-S [North-South] solar asymmetry strongly affect corresponding cycles of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).”

3. Helama et al., 2017 (full)
“Solar proxy data (Steinhilber et al., 2009) consistently illustrate low activity between AD 400 and 700, with a notable seventh-century solar minimum, the millennial-scale solar changes culminating over these centuries and thus during the DACP [Dark Ages Cold Period] (Scafetta, 2012).  Interestingly, there is multiple proxy evidence showing that reduced solar activity may modulate the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) towards its negative phase (Gray et al., 2010). Since the NAO is a leading pattern of climate variability in the global atmosphere, and the negative NAO phase is generally associated with cooler temperatures particularly over western Europe and eastern North-America for both the winter (Wanner et al., 2001; Hurrell and Deser, 2010) and summer seasons (Folland et al., 2009), a prolonged negative NAO phase could thus result in cold temperatures at least over some parts of the Northern Hemisphere continents. … Recently, a collection of multi-proxy evidence illustrated a cooling phase around the Northern Hemisphere which was tree-ring dated to AD 536-660 and termed the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA) (Büntgen et al., 2016). This event was shown to follow a multitude of large unknown volcanic eruptions in AD 536, 540 and 547, for which evidence was derived from bipolar ice-core timescales and sulphur records (Sigl et al., 2015). The cooling, having once initiated from volcanic aerosol forcing (Larsen et al. 2008), may have been sustained over extended intervals possibly because of the coinciding solar minimum and  through sea-ice/ocean feedback mechanisms (Büntgen et al., 2016; Matskovsky and Helama, 2016), analogous to findings from equivalent proxy data (Gennaretti et al., 2014) and transient climate model simulations(Miller et al., 2012) during the LIA.

4. Yukimoto et al., 2017
“A delayed response of the winter North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) to the 11-year solar cycle has been observed and modeled in recent studies. The result of this study supports a previous hypothesis that suggests that the 11-year solar cycle signals on the Earth’s surface are produced through a downward penetration of the changes in the stratospheric circulation. … The importance of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) for the European weather and climate conditions has been known for a long time (Walker and Bliss 1932; van Loon and Rogers 1978; Hurrell et al. 2003). NAO is the dominant intrinsic mode of atmospheric variability over the Atlantic sector (Hurrell and Deser 2009). … The present result confirms the previous hypothesis reported by Kodera et al. (2016), which stated that the major solar influence on the Earth’s surface can be produced through changes in stratospheric circulation, and the spatial structure of the solar signal at the Earth’s surface is largely conditioned by atmosphere’s interaction with the ocean.”

5. Wang et al., 2017
“The identification of causal effects is a fundamental problem in climate change research. Here, a new perspective on climate change causality is presented using the central England temperature (CET) dataset, the longest instrumental temperature record, and a combination of slow feature analysis and wavelet analysis. The driving forces of climate change were investigated and the results showed two independent degrees of freedom —a 3.36-year cycle and a 22.6-year cycle, which seem to be connected to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle and the Hale sunspot cycle, respectively.”

’11-Year Solar Cycle…Influences [Surface] Weather And Climate’

6. Gray et al., 2017
“There is growing evidence that variability associated with the 11-year solar cycle has an impact at the Earth’s surface and influences its weather and climate. Although the direct response to the Sun’s variability is extremely small, a number of different mechanisms have been suggested that could amplify the signal, resulting in regional signals that are much larger than expected. In this paper the observed solar cycle signal at the Earth’s surface is described, together with proposed mechanisms that involve modulation via the total incoming solar irradiance and via modulation of the ultra-violet part of the solarspectrum that influences ozone production in the stratosphere.”

7. Hood, 2017
QBO/Solar Modulation of the Boreal Winter Madden-Julian Oscillation … “The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), also known as the 30-60 day oscillation, is the strongest of the intraseasonal climate oscillations in the tropics and has significant derivative effects on extratropical circulation and intraseasonal climate. It has recently been shown that the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulates the amplitude of the boreal winter MJO such that MJO amplitudes are larger on average during the easterly phase (QBOE) than during the westerly phase (QBOW). A major possible mechanism is the decrease in static stability in the lowermost stratosphere under QBOE conditions resulting from relative upwelling associated with the QBO induced meridional circulation. Here, evidence is presented that tropical upwelling changes related to the 11-year solar cycle also modulate the boreal winter MJO. Based on 37.3 years of MJO amplitude data, the largest amplitudes and occurrence rates, and the weakest static stabilities in the tropical lower stratosphere, occur during the QBOE phase under solar minimum (SMIN) conditions while the smallest amplitudes and strongest static stabilities occur during the QBOW phase under solar maximum (SMAX) conditions. Conversely, when the QBO and solar forcings are opposed (QBOW/SMIN and QBOE/SMAX), the difference in occurrence rates becomes statistically insignificant.”

8. Gan et al., 2017
Temperature responses to the 11-year solar cycle in the mesosphere from the 31-year (1979-2010) … “Atmospheric response to the solar cycle (SC) here refers to atmospheric variability induced by the 11-year solar activity cycle. The SC [solar cycle] response originates mainly from large (4-8%) solar UV spectral irradiance change (in the range of 200-250 nm) from solar minimum to maximum condition, while the total solar flux stays nearly constant (0.1%) [Donnelly, 1991; Lean et al., 1997; Woods and Rottman, 1997; Beig et al., 2008; Gary et al., 2010]. The variability of the solar UV spectral irradiance affects the thermal structure of the atmosphere by directly changing the total energy deposited and indirectly modifying the photochemistry and dynamics of the atmosphere. In addition to the equatorial Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) [Baldwin et al., 2011] and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [Li et al., 2013], the 11-year SC is also a significant source to the inter-annual variability in the mesosphere and lower (MLT) region.”

Periods Of Low Solar Activity Explain Little Ice Age Cooling Trends

9. Pandey and Dubey, 2017
“The Maunder minimum (1645-1715) refers to a period when very few sunspots were observed. During this period, the Earth climate was cooler than normal. This period mimics the solar cycle climate change connections. The particles and electromagnetic radiations flowing from solar activity outbursts are important for long-term climate variations. There is an abrupt and drastic cooling in the climate can be possible in near future due to large scale melting of global ice by global warming, and prolonged sunspot minima. There is a close correlation between variations in the 11-year sunspot cycle and Earth’s climate. Solar activity varies on shorter-time scales, including the 11- year sunspot cycle and longer-term as Milankovitch cycle.”

10. Williams et al., 2017
“Reconstructed SSTs significantly warmed 1.1 ± 0.30°C … from 1660s to 1800 (rate of change: 0.008 ± 0.002°C/year), followed by a significant cooling of 0.8 ± 0.04°C …  until 1840 (rate of change: 0.02 ± 0.001°C/year), then a significant warming of 0.8 ± 0.16°C from 1860 until the end of reconstruction in 2007 (rate of change: 0.005 ± 0.001°C/year).” [Sea surface temperatures warmed faster from 1660s-1800 than they did from 1860-2007.]
“In fact, the SST reconstruction significantly co-varied with a reconstruction of solar irradiance [Lean, 2000] on the 11-year periodicity only from ~1745 to 1825. In addition, the reconstructed SSTs were cool during the period of lower than usual solar irradiance called the Maunder minimum (1645–1715) but then warmed and cooled during the Dalton minimum (1795–1830), a second period of reduced solar irradiance. … The Dalton solar minimum and increased volcanic activity in the early 1800s could explain the decreasing SSTs from 1800 to 1850 …  [T]hese data suggest a complex combination of solar irradiance, volcanic activity, internal ocean dynamics and external anthropogenic forcing explain the variability in Aleutian SSTs for the past 342 years.”


11. Didkovsky et al., 2017
“Radiative forcing of the Earth’s atmosphere plays a significant role in its thermal and chemical balance (Haigh, 1994; Haigh et al., 2010). Effects of heating and cooling are influenced by long-term solar-cycle changes. One example of such change compiled from sources that show sensitivity to the changes of solar activity (Hoyt and Schatten, 1998) is the Maunder Minimum of 1645 to about 1715 (Maunder, 1890). These observations demonstrate the effects of solar-activity changes during the Maunder Minimum for which low to near-zero sunspot numbers persisted for about six solar cycles (SC) with a SC-averaged period (for SC 1 to 22) of 11 years (Hathaway, 2010).”

12. Nan et al., 2017
“Furthermore, our temperature records, within age uncertainty, coincides with the changes of the solar irradiance changes, suggesting a possible link between solar forcing and climate variability. … The relationship between the solar irradiance and climate change has been demonstrated by lots of studies (He et al., 2013; Kroonenberg et al., 2007; Sagawa et al., 2014; Soon et al., 2014). It was suggested that the solar activity was a primary driving force of climatic variations in the Holocene (Bond et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2005). Small solar perturbations can be magnified by different feedback mechanisms and may ultimately lead to climatic oscillations on several time scales, such as annual to decadal and/or centennial scales, as well as millennial scales (Haigh, 1996; Bond et al., 2001).”

‘Marked Association Of Solar Activity With Weather And Climate Change’

13. Xiao et al., 2017
“Solar wind and electric-microphysical process is the key mechanism that affects climate … We investigated the influencing mechanism of high-energetic particle precipitation modulated by solar wind on the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). On a day-to-day time scale, Zhou, Tinsley, and Huang (2014) and Huang et al. (2013) found that the minima in AO and NAO indices only lagged 0~2 days of the solar wind speed (SWS) minima during years of high stratospheric aerosol loading, which suggests a much faster mechanism of solar influence on the atmospheric system compared to the ozone destruction process. From the perspective of year-to-year variation, Xiao and Li (2016) and Zhou et al. (2016) showed a robust relationship between SWS [solar wind speed] and NAO in boreal winter. These aforementioned studies indicate that the wintertime Iceland Low in the North Atlantic was very sensitive to solar wind variations and played an important role in the process of solar wind and electric-microphysical effects on climate. Moreover, under the condition of a weak electric field, we have demonstrated the marked impact of cloud droplet electricity on the collision efficiency of cloud condensation nuclei. This, in turn, suggests that the collision in a cloud microphysics process constitutes the core link between atmospheric electricity and climate (Tinsley and Leddon 2013; Tinsley and Zhou 2013, 2014). Furthermore, Tinsley and Zhou (2015) improved the collision and parameterization scheme that varied with electric quantity in a cloud microphysics process and quantitatively evaluated the effects of high-energetic particle flux on cloud charge. This achievement not only supports the marked association of solar activity with weather and climate change on various time scales, but also but also avails the quantitative accession of solar impacts on climate. It is worth noting that the successful establishment development of a theoretical model regarding of the influencing process of solar energetic particles on the atmosphere improves the development of global climate models.”

Hurricane Frequency ‘Is Synchronous With The Solar Irradiance’

14. Vyklyuk et al., 2017
“Hurricane genesis modelling based on the relationship between solar activity and hurricanes … There are a number of works concerning the Sun–Earth connections and their influence on atmospheric motions. There are a number of observations which show that within a few days after energetic solar eruptions (flares, coronal mass ejections and eruptive prominences), there are diverse meteorological responses of considerable strength (Gomes et al. 2012). … Conclusion: [T]here are several indications which are in favor that the beginning of violent cyclonic motions in Earth’s atmosphere may be caused by charged particles from the solar wind.”

15. Katsuki et al., 2017
“Typhoon frequency in East Asia is synchronous with the solar irradiance. … Several studies documented typhoon pattern changes in response to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). … The fluctuation of the solar activity plays a key role in regulating the westerly jet movement. The multi-centennial scale of the typhoon frequency in mid-latitude East Asia is therefore caused by changes in the solar activity and ENSO conditions.”

‘Climate…Follows Solar Activity Fluctuations On Multidecadal To Centennial Time Scales’

16. Moreno et al., 2017
“Understanding the Sun-Earth’s climate coupling system is both an essential and an urgent issue, with great progress achieved over the last decades (e.g., Haigh, 2007; Soon et al., 2014 for a review). Recently, Brugnara et al. (2013) referred that the Euro–Atlantic sector, in which Portugal is located, seems to be a region with a particularly strong solar influence on the troposphere, finding a significant change in the mean late winter circulation over Europe, which culminates in detectable impacts on the near-surface climate. Jiang et al. (2015) suggested that (i) climate in the northern North Atlantic regions follows SA [solar activity] fluctuations on multidecadal to centennial time scales, and (ii) it is more susceptible to the influence of those fluctuations throughout cool periods with, for instance, less vigorous ocean circulation. Similar results were found by Gómez-Navarro et al. (2012) in the context of climate simulations for the second millennium over the Iberian Peninsula, recognizing that temperature and precipitation variability is significantly affected at centennial time scales by variations in the SA [solar activity].”
“Grand Minima and Dalton-type Minimum scenarios are broadly characterized by (i) lower TSI (i.e., lower available PAR) (Lean, 1991, and references therein), (ii) development of cloudiness (e.g., Usoskin and Kovaltsov, 2008), and (iii) decreased global/regional air surface temperatures (e.g., Neukom et al., 2014) in tandem with greater regional precipitation variability.”
“The connections between solar phenomena and the lower atmosphere processes can be explained by two kind of mechanisms: (i) “top-to-down”, influencing the pole-to-equator temperature gradient and exerting an impact on the modulation of the atmospheric circulation cells, weakening or strengthening the zonal winds, and (ii) “bottom-to up” that directly impact on the radiation fluxes, energy balance and temperatures on the ground. Both finally impact the atmospheric circulation modes responsible for the global/regional precipitation and temperature patterns (e.g., Gray et al., 2010; Martin-Puertas et al., 2012; Thiéblemont et al., 2015).”

17. Lihua, 2017
“The modulation action from solar activity plays an important role in the temperature change, and there is a possible association existing in the global land-ocean temperature and solar activity on decade time scales. … About 11-year period, a remarkable oscillation of solar activity, continually exists in wavelet transform of solar variation. According to the cross wavelet transform, solar activity influences global land-ocean temperature change on ~11-year time scales during 1935-1995 with above the 5 % significance level.”

‘A Large Proportion Of [Recent] Climate Variations…Explained By TSI And Cosmic Rays’

18. Utomo, 2017
“A similar result was also found for the relationship between solar activity and cosmic ray flux with a negative correlation, i.e. 0.69/year. When solar activities decrease, the clouds cover rate increase due-0.61/month and – to secondary ions produced by cosmic rays. The increase in the cloud cover rate causes the decrease in solar constant value and solar radiation on the earth’s surface [cooling]. … The increase in the formation rate of cloud would affect the decrease in the intensity of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. The relationship between cosmic rays and solar constant is an “opposite” relationship because of the negative correlation type (r < 0). The phenomenon of “opposite” is in a good agreement with the result by Svensmark (1997) who found a correlation between temperature and global cloud coverage with the cosmic rays. … [T]he climate also depends on variations in the flux of solar energy received by the earth’s surface. Variation in the solar energy flux is caused by variations in solar activity cycle. Thus the climate is a manifestation of how solar radiation is absorbed, redistributed by the atmosphere, land and oceans, and ultimately radiated back into space. Every variation of solar energy received at the earth’s surface and reradiated by the earth into space will have a direct impact on climate change on Earth.”


19. Biktash, 2017
“The effects of total solar irradiance (TSI) and volcanic activity on long-term global temperature variations during solar cycles 19–23 [1954-2008] were studied. It was shown that a large proportion of climate variations can be explained by the mechanism of action of TSI [total solar irradiance] and cosmic rays (CRs) on the state of the lower atmosphere and other meteorological parameters. … Recent studies by Pudovkin and Raspopov, Tinsley, and Swensmark have shown that the Earth’s cloud coverage is strongly influenced by cosmic ray intensity. Conditions in interplanetary space, which can influence GCRs and climate change, have been studied in numerous works. As has been demonstrated by Biktash, the long-term CR count rate and global temperature variations in 20–23 solar cycles are modulated by solar activity and by the IMF (interplanetary magnetic field). A possible geophysical factor which is able to affect the influence of solar activity on the Earth’s climate is volcanism. The effects of volcanism can lead to serious consequences in the atmosphere and the climate.”

+2 W m-2 Per Decade Surface Solar Radiation Forcing From 1983-2013

20. Alexandri et al., 2017
“In this work, the spatiotemporal variability of surface solar radiation (SSR) is examined over the Eastern Mediterranean region for a 31-year period (1983–2013). … The satellite-based data from CERES (Cloud and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System), GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) and ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) underestimate SSR while the reanalysis data from the ERA-Interim overestimate SSR compared to CM SAF SARAH. Using a radiative transfer model and a set of ancillary data, these biases are attributed to the atmospheric parameters that drive the transmission of solar radiation in the atmosphere, namely, clouds, aerosols and water vapor [CO2 not mentioned].. … The CM SAF SARAH SSR trend was found to be positive (brightening) and statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (0.2 ± 0.05 W/m2/year [2 W m-2 per decade].”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNews site t-online.de here writes that visitors to the German Ministry of Environment will be served only vegetarian food, according to German daily Bild.
The order comes from the Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks (Socialist Party) herself. According to reports, food service companies that cater events held at the Ministry are not to provide fish or meat, or products made of meat. The rule has been in effect since February 1st. Also catered food must come from organic farms, be seasonal and locally produced with short transport distances.”
The reason for the new policy? According to the report, the Ministry must act as a “role model” in the fight against the “effects of meat consumption“.
More German climate protection madness in the pipeline
Higher taxes on meat and milk products
The dictation of people’s lifestyles does not only end at the Environment Ministry banning meat and fish at its events. but according to topagrar.com here, the Ministry is also calling for higher taxation nationwide on “animal products such as milk and meat“.

German government herding its citizens to eat like cows. Image: USDA, public domain photo
If the German government gets its way, soon a nutritious and balanced diet will become a luxury that only the rich will be able to afford. The poor will be forced to devolve to diets of herbivores, a level down the food chain. In summary: biological devolution seems to be the new direction of progress in Germany and radical environmentalists. Better to become a lowly herbivore than to risk warming the planet by a degree or two.
Humans are to be herded down the food-chain…back millions of years in evolution.

According to UBA president Maria Krautzberger: “Animal food products need to be taxed at the regular 19% VAT rate.” In Germany food is taxed at a 7% VAT rate. With the added revenue, the Ministry says it aims to lower the tax on plant products. “This will protect the climate and will be less a burden on the taxpayer,” she said. According to topagrar.de, the aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The Ministry blames the agricultural industry for being one of the country’s top greenhouse gas emitters. It claims that the production of one kilogram of beef causes between 7 and 28 kilograms of greenhouse gases, whereby 1 kg of fruit or vegetables emits less than a kilogram.
In response, the German association of farming (DBV) sharply criticizes the plans, accusing the Ministry of using misleading figures and focusing in the wrong areas.
DBV president Joachim Rukwied said: “A penalty tax on food will have no positive benefit on climate, but rather will only make the daily purchases made by consumers more expensive.”
Topagrar.de points out that agriculture in fact represents only a small fraction of the total greenhouse gas emissions: 7%, and so the focus is misplaced. Rukwied criticizes:
It is totally incomprehensible how agricultural animal farming can be put in the front row of climate sinners.”
topagrar.de quotes MIV Milk Industry Mndustry Association director Eckhard Heuser: 
Milk and milk products are among the fundamental food staples of German citizens. Families with small children, and thus having a high milk consumption, and people with low incomes will be forced to pay disproportionately more.”
The National Union of the Food Industry (BVE) has come out against the ecological control taxation on food, saying that it will only serve to “make products more expensive, distort the market and add more bureaucracy“.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
h/t Breitbart – A Malaysian Green Charity has demanded Leonardo DiCaprio return alleged proceeds of crime which were donated to his foundation. Note there is no suggestion that DiCaprio was aware the money his foundation received was tainted, at the time he accepted the money.
Rainforest Charity Urges Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to Repay Donations Linked to ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Scandal
The Bruno Manser Funds, focused on Malaysian rainforest protection, accuses the star of “double standards” for his environmental charity that is alleged to have accepted donations linked to an international money laundering scandal.
Earlier this year, Leonardo DiCaprio traveled to Indonesia to raise awareness for deforestation, visiting an area on the island of Sumatra, home to indigenous tribes and endangered animals that his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has been helping protect.
The trip generated numerous newspaper column inches, alongside pictures of the newly minted Oscar winner with several endangered elephants.
But six months on, the actor is now being accused of “double standards” for accepting donations to his charity from people linked to a corruption scandal that is itself fueling deforestation less than 500 miles away.
The Bruno Manser Funds, a rainforest charity active in Malaysian Borneo, has written an open letter to DiCaprio calling on him to return money he received from individuals connected to the 1MDB Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, now the subject of a major Justice Department asset seizure complaint. While there is no direct link between the Bruno Manser Funds and the actor, the organization says DiCaprio, as founder of his environmental charity and a designated U.N. Messenger of Peace, has a responsibility to help stop corruption.
…
But it’s not simply DiCaprio’s charitable finances that have been called into question, with Straumann also focusing on his wages for The Wolf of Wall Street, now alleged to have been funded via siphoned-off 1MBD funds. The actor is thought to have been paid as much as $25 million to star in the hit 2013 film, and more as a producer.

What a mess. For once I feel sympathy for DiCaprio. The article also alleges that DiCaprio’s $25 million wages for his part in “The Wolf of Wall Street” was paid in stolen money. DiCaprio might be a hilariously grotesque green hypocrite, but there is no evidence DiCaprio had any idea he was receiving tainted money.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump sharply changed the federal government’s approach to the environment on Tuesday as he cleared the way for two major oil pipelines that had been blocked, and set in motion a plan to curb regulations that slow other building projects. In his latest moves to dismantle the legacy of his predecessor, Mr. Trump resurrected the Keystone XL pipeline that had stirred years of debate, and expedited another pipeline in the Dakotas that had become a major flash point for Native Americans. He also signed a directive ordering an end to protracted environmental reviews. “I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it,” Mr. Trump said during a meeting with auto industry executives. “But it’s out of control, and we’re going to make it a very short process. And we’re going to either give you your permits, or we’re not going to give you your permits. But you’re going to know very quickly. And generally speaking, we’re going to be giving you your permits. ” The decisions expanded an effort to unravel much of the policy structure left by former President Barack Obama, who made fighting climate change a central priority. Just a day earlier, Mr. Trump formally abandoned the   Partnership, an ambitious   trade pact negotiated by Mr. Obama. In his opening days in office, Mr. Trump has also modified or reversed Mr. Obama’s policies on health care, abortion and housing while ordering a freeze of any pending regulations left behind by the former administration. The pipelines were more about symbol than substance but generated enormous passion on both sides of the debate. Mr. Obama rejected the proposed Keystone pipeline in 2015, arguing that it would undercut American leadership in curbing the reliance on carbon energy. The Army sidetracked the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota last month in the waning days of the Obama administration. Environmental activists quickly denounced Mr. Trump’s decisions. “Donald Trump has been in office for four days, and he’s already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. Mr. Trump made clear on the campaign trail that he saw Mr. Obama’s environmental policies as a threat to the economy and dismissed climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China. Myron Ebell, a climate change denier who headed Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, has drafted a   blueprint for how he could eliminate Mr. Obama’s climate change policies. “It is designed to implement all of the president’s campaign trail promises  —   every single one,” Mr. Ebell said this week in an interview. Mr. Trump’s biggest target may be emission rules that would force the closing of hundreds of   power plants meant to be replaced by wind and solar power. But they are caught up in court battles that could run for months or years. By contrast, he could more quickly soften Mr. Obama’s rules requiring tougher vehicle emission standards. Mr. Trump met on Tuesday with executives of major American automakers, who complained that before leaving office, Mr. Obama finalized an ambitious E. P. A. rule requiring that vehicles average 54. 5 miles per gallon by 2026. Mr. Trump said he would help with burdensome regulations, but offered no specifics. Mr. Trump could lift a moratorium instituted last year by Mr. Obama on new coal mining leases on public lands. As soon as next month, the   Congress may pass legislation undoing Mr. Obama’s regulations on the practice of   coal mining and on leaks of   methane emissions from oil and gas drilling rigs. In the meantime, the Keystone and Dakota pipelines provided Mr. Trump with visible ways to demonstrate action. As proposed by TransCanada, an Alberta firm, Keystone would carry 800, 000 barrels a day from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast. Republicans and some Democrats said that it would create jobs and expand energy resources, while environmentalists said it would encourage a form of oil extraction that produces more gases that warm the planet than normal petroleum. Studies showed that the pipeline would not have a momentous effect on jobs or the environment, but both sides made it into a symbolic test case. The State Department estimated that Keystone would support 42, 000 temporary jobs for two years  —   about 3, 900 of them in construction and the rest through indirect support, like food service  —   but only 35 permanent jobs. Similarly, the government concluded that Keystone’s carbon emissions would equal less than 1 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. “Keystone has never been a significant issue from an environmental point of view in substance, only in symbol,” said David L. Goldwyn, an energy market analyst and a former head of the State Department’s energy bureau in the Obama administration. But it was a symbol Mr. Trump found important enough to seize on early in his presidency. He signed an executive memorandum inviting TransCanada “to promptly resubmit its application to the Department of State for a presidential permit” for the pipeline, although the document did not guarantee approval. The president told reporters he would “renegotiate some of the terms”  —   including possibly an insistence that the pipeline be built with American steel  —   but left little doubt that he wanted it approved. “We’ll see if we can get that pipeline built,” he said. “A lot of jobs. ” In a statement, TransCanada accepted his invitation to seek permission again. “We are currently preparing the application and intend to do so,” the company said, vowing that it would create jobs and still protect waterways and other sensitive resources. The Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota became the focus of protests when the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected to its construction less than a mile from its reservation. The tribe and its allies won victory last month when the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would look for alternative routes for the $3. 7 billion pipeline instead of allowing it to be drilled under a dammed section of the Missouri River. Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum directing the Army “to review and approve in an expedited manner” the pipeline, “to the extent permitted by law and as warranted. ” In his session with reporters, he added, “Again, subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us. ” Mr. Trump owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the company that is building the Dakota Access pipeline, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. Last month, a spokesman for Mr. Trump said he sold all of his stock in June, but there is no way of verifying that sale, and Mr. Trump has not provided documentation of it. Critics vowed to keep resisting the projects. Jan Hasselman, a lawyer for Earthjustice, an environmental law group representing the tribe, said Mr. Trump was discarding the findings of a review. “They’re just ignoring the problems that the government has already found,” he said, “and that is the kind of thing that courts need to review very closely. ” In Canada, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed Mr. Trump’s decision. “We have been supportive of this since the day we were sworn into government,” Jim Carr, the natural resources minister, told reporters. Mr. Carr said the American reversal will lead “to a deepening of the relationship across the border. ” In addition to the Keystone and Dakota directives, Mr. Trump signed three others intended to ease the way for businesses and to promote American manufacturing. One instructed the Commerce Department to develop a plan to ensure that future pipelines built in the United States be constructed of   materials. Another was aimed at streamlining what he called “the incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process and reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing. ” The last directive was intended to expedite environmental reviews for “  infrastructure projects” like highways and bridges. Some news reports on Tuesday said that the E. P. A. and other departments had issued orders forbidding employees from issuing news releases or posting on social media. But longtime officials in multiple agencies said the guidance was similar to that of when Mr. Obama took office eight years ago."

It was in Malaysia that I first experienced what I now dub “anti‐​human environmentalism”.



Sitting in the country’s ministry of energy, technology, science, climate change and environment, a government scientist presented us with a two‐​axis diagram. The lines represented “the natural world” and “human activity.” As he laboured over all the environmental depletion we were purportedly responsible for, I tentatively asked: “Do you assume, then, that human beings are just not part of the natural world?” The silence spoke volumes.



Humanity faces huge challenges relating to our coexistence with wildlife, forms of pollution and risks associated with a changing climate. As economists might say, our activities do indeed produce “externalities”. But doomsday anti‐​human thinkers, who see us as mere leeches on Earth, have been utterly wrong in one crucial respect: the idea that growth is rapidly depleting natural resources.





Provided we maintain sound economic policies, worrying about humans depleting resources amounts to unfounded hysteria.



The biologist Paul Ehrlich is perhaps the most famous proponent of this idea. In his 1968 bestselling book, The Population Bomb, he advanced the idea of resource depletion. He renewed this attack at a 2017 Vatican conference, saying: “You can’t go on growing forever on a finite planet. The biggest problem we face is the continued expansion of the human enterprise … Perpetual growth is the creed of a cancer cell.” The Prince of Wales thinks similarly. He has lamented that Earth just doesn’t have the capacity to “sustain us all” if more and more people consume natural resources at “Western levels”.



This notion, that humans are like pigs eating from a finite trough, is intuitive. The Earth, logically, appears to have limited natural reserves. If one accepts this, it follows that bigger population or higher consumption levels will deplete the Earth’s riches. The implications are obvious: first, infinite growth is impossible due to these constraints on physical resources; second, to avoid the rapid depletion of the Earth’s resources, we must limit population growth, reduce consumption, or both.



Such thinking is remarkably common among scientists. But it is uneconomic. What it ignores, as the great University of Maryland economist Julian Simon highlighted, is the capacity of human ingenuity to find new recipes and ideas. Anti‐​human thinkers fail to appreciate that our brains are also a resource. When toiling under the right institutions and market‐​based incentives — i.e. prices — we constantly dream up new ways of making or doing things, including new methods of discovery or means of excavating raw materials.



Yes, consumption and population growth put pressure on resource availability. But markets provide us with incentives to change our behaviour or innovate. High prices caused by higher demand encourage us to shift to consuming substitutes in the short term. In the longer term they encourage us to seek out new supply or to rethink our whole approach. If this second effect dominates, the prices of natural resources could fall with population growth. More humans, after all, means a greater brain capacity for ideas to engender abundance.



That is exactly what my Cato colleague Marian L Tupy, and Gale L Pooley of Brigham Young University, find in a fascinating new paper. The facts speak for themselves. Looking at a basket of 50 global commodities between 1980 and 2017, they find real prices fell by an average of 36pc. That happened despite the global population increasing by 69pc over the same period.



A more accurate way to assess the “cost” to humans of these commodities is to calculate their “time price” — the amount of time an average human must work to earn enough to buy them. On that metric, the cost of these commodities fell much further — by a whopping 65pc. If it took 60 minutes of work to buy this basket in 1980, it only took 21 minutes of work to afford them in 2017. A continuation of that trend would see prices of these natural resources halve every 26 years.



This utterly refutes the anti‐​human narrative and shows that Julian Simon was right. Population growth, far from exhausting resources, seems to be making them more plentiful. In fact, our current situation indicates a “super abundance”: prices (in terms of working time) are falling at a rate proportionally faster than the increase in population.



How does this make sense, physically, on a planet of notionally fixed resources? Tupy and Pooley use a beautiful analogy. They state: “The world is a closed system in the way that a piano is a closed system. The instrument has only 88 notes, but those notes can be played in a nearly infinite variety of ways. The same applies to our planet. The Earth’s atoms may be fixed, but the possible combinations of those atoms are infinite. What matters, then, is not the physical limits of our planet, but human freedom to experiment and reimagine the use of resources that we have.”



It is wrong, in other words, to think of human activity as a pure consumption of our physical inheritance. Our existence, provided we are governed by sound institutions, encourages new and innovative ways to fulfil wants and needs by combining and exploring the resources available to us. Earlier this year, for example, scientists discovered a 16m‐​ton patch of deep‐​sea mud rich with “rare earths” almost 800 miles off the coast of Japan. They estimate it could serve the planet’s need for those rare earths for between 400 and 800 years. The earth’s natural resources are neither fully known nor fixed in any meaningful sense.



Neither, therefore, are the opportunities for growth. As former US president Ronald Reagan summarised succinctly: “There are no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits to the human capacity for intelligence, imagination and wonder.” Provided we maintain sound economic policies, worrying about humans depleting resources amounts to unfounded hysteria.

"The chaotic failure of the government’s pilot badger cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire, aimed at curbing bovine TB, illustrates some of the problems that arise when policymakers ignore scientific studies and pursue their own agendas. This is, more often than not, simply to be “seen to be doing something”. The marksmen have, unsurprisingly, missed their targets to remove 70% of badgers in the culling areas. Badger population estimates are being continuously revised and now the cull’s duration has been extended to between six and eight weeks, in the hope that targets can be met. If only those badgers didn’t keep moving the goalposts. But this figure of 70% is entirely arbitrary anyway, picked to follow the previous protocol established by the Randomised Badger Culling Trial between 1998 and 2006. But the recommendations of this trial were also that culling be intensive, co-ordinated, and take less than two weeks, to avoid stirring up the badger population - the so-called the perturbation effect - causing them to scatter and spread bTB further.  Why follow one recommendation and not the others? The current badger culling policy lacks any scientific coherence and appears to be based solely on political posturing by Owen Paterson to please the Tory party and the National Farmers’ Union. As such it will be very difficult to monitor, evaluate and justify. What level of bovine TB reduction is being sought? Over what time period? At what cost? Professor Ian Boyd, the new chief scientific adviser at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), recently attempted to justify the ad hoc, policy on the hoof, bolster its scientific justification and clarify the role of scientists and scientific evidence in government policy. Scientists, he opined, should not “create conflict between themselves and policymakers, since this could set back the cause of science in government”. They should only communicate through “embedded advisers” (that is, himself) and be “the single voice of reason, rather than dissent, in the public arena”. How unnerving for the scientific community? The funding implications for future research proposals are both obvious and alarming. The Independent Scientific Group, set up by Defra, carried out the RBCT - to date the only reliable UK evidence there is. But Defra ignored the conclusions of the £50m bTB control study they had requested. Despite the findings being peer reviewed by eminent scientists, its conclusions that “given its high costs and low benefits, badger culling is unlikely to contribute usefully to the control of cattle TB in Britain” have been wilfully ignored, seemingly to satisfy political whims. Given that the government ignored their own report, was it because the ISG failed to join up the dots (data) correctly? Did the group exceed its brief, straying too far into the policy arena by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis? The government’s chief scientific adviser of the time, Professor Sir David King, dismissed the 280-page report after a cursory day’s selective reading with his chosen five experts. Politicians and policy officials do not “listen carefully to what science says on difficult subjects” as Boyd states. They only listen to what they want to hear, and Hilary Benn and Owen Paterson have very different hearing aids. The role of science is to provide information to decision makers, but decision makers need to listen too. If we are to be told the Independent Scientific Group “got it wrong”, the scientific community needs to be given a more convincing explanation as to where and why. Control of bTB is very complex, and the UK government is struggling. The disease cost more than £1 billion between 2004-2012, and up to 28,000 infected cattle are slaughtered each year. Current bTB control policy - rigorous cattle testing, slaughter of those that test positive, and compensation for the farmers - has done little to arrest either the incidence or spread of the disease. Four different bTB options are currently being pursued across the British Isles: proactive badger culling in England, badger vaccination in Wales, test and vaccinate in Northern Ireland, and reactive badger culling in the Republic of Ireland. Boyd amazingly suggests that all four are “more or less correct”. This is a cop-out. We have a duty to test and demonstrate which one is more likely to be economically efficient and successful. This is taxpayers’ money we are playing with, and the consequences affect the livelihoods of farmers, and the lives of cows and badgers. Defra should come clean and inform the public why the Independent Scientific Group findings are “incorrect” and why it binned the evidence to satisfy its political masters. What chance transparency, scientific honesty and evidence-based environmental policy? I fear that yet again we have set off on a costly and unsuccessful wild goose chase thanks to Defra’s structures, procedures and inherent biases. When will environmental scientists ever be listened to?"

Now he looks at some inconvenient realities concerning the consequences for electricity generation if the government tries to achieve their unrealistic and pointless cuts in carbon dioxide emissions.
The paper compares five “energy mix” options with a “business as usual” case for electricity generation in Australia from 2010 to 2050.  The options involve mixes of coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar thermal technologies.  The analysis indicates that continuing with the current mix of electricity sources (mainly coal) will provide the cheapest electricity. Gas, the other carbon fuel, has the next higher cost. All of the non-coal options (nuclear, solar and wind) will substantially increase electricity costs with solar being the most expensive.
Nuclear power is the only feasible option that could achieve the promised cuts in emissions. Wind and solar are very high cost options with little hope of achieving the emissions cuts promised, either alone or in combination.

"**HSBC plans to speed up job cuts after interim profits plunged and the bank said bad loans linked to the coronavirus could reach $13bn (Â£9.8bn).**
HSBC boss Noel Quinn said it will ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which included axing 35,000 jobs.
""Our operating environment has changed significantly since the start of the year,"" he said.
Mr Quinn also said the bank would examine ""additional actions"" to strengthen its business.
Europe's biggest bank reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year - much steeper than analysts had forecast.
HSBC also said it set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic.
This is higher than previously budgeted for, taking into account the effects of the economic downturn.
The bank said it had given more than 700,000 payment holidays on loans, credit cards and mortgages, providing more than $27bn in customer relief.
HSBC has also been hit by the low interest rate environment, which squeezes a bank's profit margins on the loans it provides. The lower the interest rate, the less a bank makes on its lending.
In June, the UK's largest bank said it would push ahead with its plan to cut 35,000 jobs from a global workforce of 235,000 as part of a major restructuring announced in February.
The job cuts had initially been put on hold during the coronavirus outbreak.
HSBC chairman Mark Tucker is overseeing the programme to shrink the bankâs operations in Europe and the US.
The bank has previously said it could wind down or sell its US retail banking operations which could involve shrinking its 224-strong US branch network by about 30%.
While HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong.
The bank is dealing with a number of challenges, including tensions between China and the west.
It is currently embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong while pushing ahead with the major restructure of its global banking operations.
""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors,"" said Mr Quinn.
""Current tensions between China and the US inevitably create challenging situations for an organisation with HSBC's footprint.
""However, the need for a bank capable of bridging the economies of east and west is acute, and we are well placed to fulfil this role.""
It's Europe's largest bank, headquartered in London, but the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation makes half of its money in Asia.
And it's been caught in the midst of increasingly tempestuous relations between China and the West, with the bank expressing support for China's controversial security laws in Hong Kong in June, breaking a tradition of neutrality.
Chief executive Noel Quinn attempted to reinstate that neutrality today, saying: ""We will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the long-term needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors.""
But who are those customers? Mr Quinn also signalled the resumption of restructuring plans which will pivot the business further towards Asia, with job cuts expected in the UK investment bank and the American branch network.
Its branding is familiar around the globe, but HSBC is a bank that likes to stay out of the headlines.
However, as it chases its ambitions, more pressure and scrutiny will be hard to dodge.
HSBC, along with rival banking group Standard Chartered, have come under fire for their support of Chinaâs controversial national security law for Hong Kong.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and UK politicians criticised HSBC for supporting China's new legislation, which means people face prosecution for speaking out against Beijing.
Mr Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) ""browbeating"" of HSBC ""should serve as a cautionary tale"".
Last week, Standard Chartered restated its commitment to Hong Kong when it released its first-half results.
Standard Chartered's group chairman JosÃ© ViÃ±als said: ""We are convinced that more collaboration - not less - is the best way to find a sustainable equilibrium in these complex situations, but we do not expect an easy or quick resolution.
""We do believe, however, that Hong Kong will continue to play a key role as an international financial hub and we are fully committed to contributing to its continued success,"" he added."
"Up to £1,500 could be added to the cost of new petrol and diesel cars in order to subsidise electric car purchases, under proposals being considered by the government. Forcing buyers of more polluting vehicles to pay towards making electric cars cheaper, a so-called “feebate” system, would be one of the most effective ways to encourage a faster move away from fossil fuels, according to a feasibility report commissioned by the Department for Transport (DfT).  The car industry said it was opposed to measures that penalised petrol and diesel buyers rather than just incentivising electric and hybrid car sales. Other recommendations from the report include forcing all petrol stations to install electric car charge points, giving government bodies incentives to buy electric cars for their fleets, and rebranding existing government support for electric car charging as “free fuel”. The government is seeking to accelerate the take-up of electric cars, which is seen as a key part of plans to reduce the UK’s emissions of carbon dioxide. Electric cars, with zero carbon dioxide exhaust emissions, accounted for only 5% of total sales in the year to August, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). While the market share of electric cars is accelerating rapidly, the DfT commissioned the Behavioural Insights Team, the so-called “nudge unit” spun out from government, to study ways of encouraging more buyers to switch as it aims to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, or possibly even earlier. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, on Wednesday indicated that the government would take up many of the report’s proposals, including green-painted parking spaces reserved for electric cars and installing charging points at tourist sites. However, proposals to penalise buyers of new fossil fuel cars in order to benefit electric car buyers directly are likely to prove highly controversial. The report noted that support from the public was low. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: “We need positive measures, not those that penalise consumers who cannot yet afford the latest electric technology, do not have adequate charging facilities, or for whom driving requirements are not suited to electrification. “To do otherwise could risk stalling fleet renewal and delaying environmental improvements by leaving them with no alternative but to keep their older vehicle for longer.” The Conservative government has repeatedly shied away from measures that would raise costs for the drivers of internal combustion engine cars. It has frozen fuel duty for years, at an estimated cost of £5.5bn between 2010 and 2020 – although recent reports have suggested that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, could be considering raising duty to pay for the costs of the pandemic. The feasibility report says that a feebate would be preferable to introducing lower rates of VAT for electric cars, another option considered by the report, because a feebate would be more flexible to implement. Both options were among the highest-impact proposals considered by the report. Feebates, also known as “bonus-malus” schemes, are already in place in other countries, including France and Sweden."
"**Up to three million Hong Kong residents are to be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship, Boris Johnson has said.**
The PM said Hong Kong's freedoms were being violated by a new security law and those affected would be offered a ""route"" out of the former UK colony.
About 350,000 UK passport holders, and 2.6 million others eligible, will be able to come to the UK for five years.
And after a further year, they will be able to apply for citizenship.
British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong were granted special status in the 1980s but currently have restricted rights and are only entitled to visa-free access to the UK for six months.
Under the government's plans, all British Overseas Nationals and their dependants will be given right to remain in the UK, including the right to work and study, for five years. At this point, they will be able to apply for settled status, and after a further year, seek citizenship.
The PM said Tuesday's passing of a new security law by the Hong Kong authorities was a ""clear and serious breach"" of the 1985 Sino-British joint declaration - a legally binding agreement which set out how certain freedoms would be protected for the 50 years after China assumed sovereignty in 1997.
""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration,"" he said.
""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British National (Overseas) status to enter the UK, granting them limited leave to remain with the ability to live and work in the UK and thereafter to apply for citizenship. And that is precisely what we will do now.""
Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald expressed the government's ""deep concern"" about the new law to China during a meeting with the country's ambassador Liu Xioming.
The UK government has been raising concerns about the national security law and very publicly trying to pressure Beijing into a change heart.
That has clearly failed - so ministers are now fulfilling their promise to allow some three million British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK. This is a significant move and the government wants to send a strong message.
But there will be more pressure now to rethink other elements of our relationship with China - not least the deal to allow Huawei to build parts of the UK's 5G structures.
Many Tory MPs have been lobbying against that for some time - and this will only add to their concern.
Updating MPs on the details, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas and the application process would be simple.
""This is a special, bespoke, set of arrangements developed for the unique circumstances we face and in light of our historic commitment to the people of Hong Kong,"" he said.
Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, Mr Raab acknowledged there ""would be little we could do toâ¦cohesively force"" China to allow British Overseas Nationals to come to the UK.
Downing Street said further details of the scheme will be detailed ""in due course"".
In the meantime, British National Overseas Passport holders in Hong Kong will be able to travel to the UK immediately, subject to standard immigration checks, the prime minister's official spokesman said.
They will also will not face salary thresholds to gain their visas, he added.
Hong Kong's new national security law, which targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison, came into effect on Tuesday.
**By Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong**
I was born in Hong Kong before 1997, the year when Hong Kong was handed back to Chinese rule. That means I had a British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a child.
When the news broke that BNO passport holders were eligible for British citizenship after living and working in the UK for five years, and after spending another year of being granted settled status, many of my friends were excited. They say at least there's a way out for Hong Kongers after the national security law came into force.
But many questions remain. Currently there are 350,000 BNO passport holders, but about three million Hong Kong residents are eligible for BNO passports - and that doesn't appear to include dependants born after 1997.
Will the UK be ready to take in so many Hong Kong residents? Will there be enough jobs? Will BNO passport holders have recourse to public funds? And will they be covered by the NHS?
Some also say it's good that there's a lifeboat, but do they really want to leave their home?
Several people have already been arrested under the new powers, including a man carrying a pro-independence flag as police used pepper spray to disperse some protesters gathered to mark 23 years since British rule ended.
Critics say it effectively puts an end to the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the Joint Declaration. China has rejected criticism of its actions, saying they are internal matters.
The UK government has come under growing pressure to take a firm line with Beijing from MPs, who are worried about China's increasingly assertive role regionally and the security implications of Chinese firm Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network.
Mr Raab said he wanted a positive relationship with China but Beijing had ""broken its promise"" to the people of Hong Kong through its ""flagrant assault"" on freedom of speech and right of peaceful assembly.
Labour said it welcomed the government's action but said there must be no discrimination on those allowed into the UK on the basis of income or other factors.
Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the UK also had a responsibility to consider the welfare of those who were not able to re-locate or who wished to stay in Hong Kong.
She urged the government to work with its international partners, through the UN, to force an inquiry into police brutality in Hong Kong and also called for the UK to re-examine its commercial relationship with China.
""For too long in relation to China we've had no strategy at home and no strategy abroad. I hope he can give us a commitment today that this marks the start of a very different era,"" she said.

I have been working with a few local business people, helping them to put together an application for funds from the government from their stimulus package, announced last Tuesday. While I spent some time preparing figures to demonstrate the 30% downturn in income from last year, it seems it was a wasted effort, as all that is needed is a declaration from the business owner. The process is simple and the funds are often paid over more or less immediately. I give the government a big tick for not wrapping this process in red tape, and also for making money available immediately, but the lack of evidence of reduced income opens the system up to abuse. 



Nevertheless, judging by the number of business people looking for assistance, it is my opinion that the $5.1 billion allocated to this will run out very fast. Remember that it is only $5.1 billion, out of a total $12 billion, as the rest of it goes to beneficiaries, tax changes (which will be a reduction in government revenue over the next 4 years rather than money to be borrowed right now) and a paltry $500 million to the health sector. My guess is that this money will run out within 3 months, but the pandemic will still be with us then. Some businesses may be operating at full strength by then, but many won’t, and with the threat of imminent lockdowns, things will get much worse before they get better.



Many other countries are doing much more for their people. The rescue package in Britain is a generous one, unprecedented in Britain’s history… but it may well be needed.



In an unprecedented step for the British government, the chancellor, [Rishi Sunak](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak), said the state would pay grants covering up to 80% of the salary of workers if companies kept them on their payroll, rather than lay them off as the economy crashes. The extraordinary payments will be worth up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, just above the median income.



Coming just days after the government announced [a business bailout package worth £350bn](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact) to help firms cope with the lockdown of large parts of the British economy as the disease spreads, the chancellor described his revamped plan as one of the most comprehensive in the world and “unprecedented in British history”. City economists said the new plan would cost an additional £78bn.



He said there would be no limit on the funding available to pay people’s wages. The payments will be backdated to the start of March, will be up and running within weeks, open initially for at least three months, and could be extended if necessary. 



Ours is paltry by comparison, and if we are not going to face total ruin, the government is going to have to come up with a lot more money before long. Jacinda may well regret increasing benefits at a time when beneficiaries are the only people whose incomes are secure, but it is too late now.



So where is all this money going to come from? They have borrowed for their infrastructure projects, and now are borrowing for this, meaning that they are now increasing borrowing at an exponential rate. That simply cannot go on. We will end up with massive deficits very soon, and although the pandemic is mostly to blame, the government really needed a lesson in how quickly things can change… and they just got it. 



As an aside, a conversation with someone in the infrastructure sector this week indicated that the proposed roading projects that the government has taken out of mothballs are a long way from being ‘shovel ready’. Because they were shelved over 2 years ago, even though some of the projects were close to commencement, it will now take at least a couple of years to get the proverbial ball rolling again. What a shame that is. Grant Robertson was extremely wide of the mark when he described these projects as ‘shovel ready’ and the jobs they could have generated at a time like this would have made quite a difference to the economy. What an incredibly short-sighted government this is.



To save money, there are lots of projects that this government could reduce spending on, or stop it all together. At least the Greens’ travel budgets will be decimated this year, as they all learn how to teleconference, but think of all the other savings that could be made. Where should I start?



 **We could cut funding to the UN** , as globalisation is now mostly dead in the water, and it has to be said, they have gone very quiet on this pandemic. Obviously, there are limited opportunities for UN officials and delegates to gain from the trough at the moment.



We could get rid of the policy that makes the **first year of university fees free.**



We could forget about climate change, **cancel the Zero Carbon Bill** , stop pouring funds into countries that couldn’t administer their way out of a paper bag and let us get on with dealing with a real crisis… for a change.



We could **stop taking refugees**.



We could **stop paying international aid** , and look after our own for a change.



We could **[stop pouring money into Pike River](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/51m-is-not-enough/)** , and leave the poor guys in peace.



There must be billions of dollars of savings that could be made by cutting out some of this government’s crazy and wasteful schemes, and this is money that could be used to help business at a time when they really need it.



But they won’t. Of course, they won’t.



Instead, the most likely outcome is that there will be **tax increases within a year**. After all, this has got to be paid for somehow, and there never was a Labour-led government that didn’t increase taxes somewhere along the line. I’m sure Jacinda would not want to break the chain.



Nevertheless, if they applied a little bit of common sense, there is a lot they could do to shore up government money. But using the words ‘socialist government’ and ‘common sense’ in the same sentence is not something we can do. Socialists are prolific wastrels when it comes to government revenues; they spend it like water until, as Margaret Thatcher famously said, they run out of ‘other people’s money’.



It was a nice thought though, don’t you think?

Ocean drives
Therefore, it is all the more interesting that a new paper has just been published, telling us Europe’s climate is foremost driven by ocean cycles.
In a paper by Marius Årthun et al appearing in Nature Communication titled: Skillful prediction of northern climate provided by the ocean, researchers checked whether anomalous heat in the Gulf Stream’s northern extension provided predictability of northwestern European and Arctic climate.
Result: “Variations in ocean temperature in the high latitude North Atlantic and Nordic Seas are reflected in the climate of northwestern Europe and in winter Arctic sea ice extent” and that “a significant part of northern climate variability thus can be skillfully predicted up to a decade in advance based on the state of the ocean“. No, not CO2.

New study shows that ocean cycles allow for “skillful prediction” of northern climate. Source: Nature Communication here.
Norway will cool
What does it mean for the immediate climate future? The paper’s abstract writes:

Particularly, we predict that Norwegian air temperature will decrease over the coming years, although staying above the long-term (1981–2010) average. Winter Arctic sea ice extent will remain low but with a general increase towards 2020.”
If the authors are correct, it’s obvious that for the next few years CO2 will not be able to prevent Norway from cooling and winter Arctic sea ice from growing. That means the ocean is a more powerful driver. The Arctic obviously is strongly connected to the oceans, much more so than some alarmist scientists would have us believe.
Winter sea ice rebound expected

The authors also make further interesting points that certainly should be a surprise to those stuck on rapid manmade warming and ice melt. For example the scientists found an influence of “poleward ocean heat anomalies on northern climate” and that it may be possible to make predictions for the region beyond decades.
They write: “Our sea ice prediction is furthermore in agreement with recent model results predicting a rebound in winter sea ice extent as a result of decreased poleward heat transport.”
According to the authors, he North Atlantic has been cooling recently, a trend which is “predicted to continue over the coming years” and that “a further cooling of Norwegian SAT [surface air temperature] might therefore be expected” beyond their prediction horizon.
Ocean variability exerts “strong influence”
The authors emphasize there is “compelling evidence that oceanic variability exerts a strong influence on northern climate on multi-annual timescales“.

Recently, there was a timeline comic from XKCD about the history of Earth’s temperature over the Holocene which got quite a bit of play, due to the fact that it had the inevitable “hockey stick” splice onto the end. Josh came up with a much less dogmatic and more detailed version, which we covered here.
That led Javier, who is a PhD level scientist in molecular biology and biochemistry who recently published an essay at Dr. Judith Curry’s website here, to come up with a similar but even more technical cartoon. We may have more on his essay later, but for right now I present his excellent timeline cartoon, that includes Earth’s obliquity and temperature over the last 20,000 years. Changes in Earth’s obliquity and thus solar insolation angles is believed to be the main driver of long term climate change, initiating and ending ice ages. As seen in the diagram below, the angle between Earth’s rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit (obliquity) oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing at a rate of about 0.013° per century.

An often-cited 1980 study by Imbrie determined that,
“Ignoring anthropogenic and other possible sources of variation acting at frequencies higher than one cycle per 19,000 years, this model predicts that the long-term cooling trend that began some 6,000 years ago will continue for the next 23,000 years”
With that in mind, have a look at Javier’s cartoon:

"There is now a special magazine called “Carbon Capture Journal” devoted to carbon capture pipe dreams.
But despite all the hype, there still isn’t any commercial scale power plant (1000 MW) operating anywhere in the world that captures and stores CO2.
There are gas and oil rigs that pump it back down into reservoirs, there one small 200 MW pilot/demonstration generator in Germany that captures the CO2 and then trucks the CO2 halfway across Germany to an injection point (but is it a real commercially viable plant anyway – or just a heavily subsidized exercise in PR?).
All a big fronted farce designed to gather lots of Government funding (our tax money!!)

"Extinction Rebellion has described government moves to treat the climate crisis protest movement as an organised crime group as “ridiculous”. The group said associating it with the state’s definition of a crime gang as “characterised by violence or the threat of violence and by the use of bribery and corruption” was an insult to the thousands of ordinary citizens who supported its cause.  On Sunday the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, condemned an Extinction Rebellion protest that disrupted the distribution of national newspapers. Starmer said: “The free press is the cornerstone of democracy and we must do all we can to protect it. Denying people the chance to read what they choose is wrong and does nothing to tackle climate change.” Defending its protests outside two printing presses in Hertfordshire and Merseyside, Extinction Rebellion said the government’s threatened reclassification was “hardly an accurate description of the thousands of ordinary people – the nurses, the doctors, the grandparents and others – who take part in Extinction Rebellion’s non-violent protests”. More than 100 protesters used vehicles and bamboo structures to block roads outside the Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire and Knowsley, near Liverpool, on Friday evening. Hertfordshire police said delivery lorries had not left the Broxbourne site as of 6am on Saturday, and that 42 arrests had been made. The presses print the News UK titles including the Sun, Times, Sun on Sunday and Sunday Times, as well as the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday and the London Evening Standard.  Boris Johnson and the home secretary, Priti Patel, also condemned the blockades. It was reported on Sunday that the prime minister and home secretary had asked Whitehall officials to take a fresh look at how Extinction Rebellion was classified in law. Ministers were said to be looking into new powers to give police greater scope to intercept demonstrators.  Extinction Rebellion accused the Conservative government of bending to the will of Rupert Murdoch and other media tycoons. “Extinction Rebellion decided to stop the distribution of the print version of several newspapers for one day and suddenly our politicians are up in arms. Where were they when our ‘free press’ was being bought up by billionaires?” the group said. In response to the disruption, the Telegraph announced that all its online content would be free to read until Monday morning. In a statement published on its website the Telegraph said: “On Friday night, a group of extremists from Extinction Rebellion blockaded the printing plants where the Telegraph and other titles are produced. Production of those newspapers was severely affected and many of our loyal readers were denied the opportunity to read the fine journalism that we produced. “Therefore we have made the decision that all Telegraph journalism published this weekend is now free to read on our website until Monday morning.”"

From December 6 through the 18th, a conference sponsored by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will gather in Copenhagen, Denmark, to explore ways to “prevent global warming” and I would like to be among the first to tell all those idiots checking their passports and deciding what to pack that they can all stay home.
This is not an original thought on my part and, in fact, is occasioned by Prof. Henrik Svensmark. He is director of the Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Technical University of Denmark and, not surprisingly, knows a lot about the Sun and climate.

Permit me to share some of his thoughts. In a September 9th opinion titled, “While the Sun Sleeps”, Prof. Svensmark wrote, “Last week, the scientific team behind the SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) reported that the number of sunspot-free days suggest that solar activity is heading towards its lowest level in about 100 years.”
“Everything indicates that the Sun is moving into a hibernation-like state and the obvious question is whether it has any significance for us on Earth.” Good question, Professor! Particularly since the Sun is the sole source of heat for the Earth. When it takes a nap, everybody takes notice.
The professor then had a little professorial fun describing the Little Ice Age that occurred after a period of medieval warmth that had begun around 1000 AD. After 1300, however, it got a lot colder. Settlements in Greenland disappeared. The Thames froze over repeatedly. And here’s where we need to pay attention, there were “long periods of crop failure.” Between starvation and disease, it reduced the population of Europe by about a third.
“It is important to note that the Little Ice Age was a global event,” said Prof. Svensmark. It did not end until the mid-to-late 19th century; around 1850 in America. Do your math. That’s five centuries. As the Earth began to warm up and particularly in the last fifty years, “solar activity has been the highest since the medieval warmth of 1,000 years ago.”
Now, keep in mind that a couple of hundred, perhaps a thousand or more diplomats, scientists, and environmentalists are going to gather in Copenhagen for the single purpose of extending or expanding the Kyoto Protocols that are based on the assertion that the Earth is warming even though it is not.
Moreover, the IPCC will announce that, if the industrialized nations do not dramatically reduce the production of “greenhouse gases” (carbon dioxide), we are all doomed. In the United States, the Cap-and-Trade bill which passed the House by a slim margin will be up for consideration in the Senate. It is based on the global warming lie. It will drive up the cost of energy for all Americans and basically wreck the economy!
Like the witches in Macbeth, for years the IPCC has been stirring a cauldron of lies about global warming and the world’s media, intoxicated by the fumes rising from the pot, have never ceased from telling us that the Earth is warming when it is not.
The Sun, however, is not cooperating.
“It now appears that the Sun…is heading towards what is called ‘a grand minimum’ as we saw in the Little Ice Age,” says Prof. Svensmark.
“Indeed, global warming has stopped and cooling is beginning.” At a recent World Climate Conference in Geneva one of the participants predicted the cooling will likely continue through the next 10 to 20 years.
All those IPCC computer models that have been predicting global warming were wrong, are wrong, and will remain wrong for all time until the Earth actually begins to warm again.
If, however, the Earth slips into a new Ice Age and not just a “little” one, it will be several hundred thousand years before they are valid.
The Copenhagen conference is, like global warming, a hoax.
I hear it’s very cold in Copenhagen in the winter.

"Will Happer Testimony on Climate Change, and a message for the Carbon Sense Coalition.
“Many of my fellow Americans and I have been following the debate in Australia and New Zealand over what to do about climate change. It has been a pleasure to read the clear-thinking discussions of this issue by the Carbon Sense Coalition. I fervently hope that good sense will win the day down under.  You are not alone, and a growing number of Americans support you and are willing to stand up and be counted as opposing the attempts to demonize carbon dioxide. 
“As in your countries, those who would condemn most of the world’s population to a bleak, impoverished future, are motivated by reasons ranging from sincere but mistaken belief in the rightness of their cause, to completely cynical goals of profit and increased tax revenue.

"Carbon and carbon dioxide are found all around us. All living things contain carbon - it’s one of the essential building blocks of life and is fundamental to many chemical processes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced by respiration and combustion and is used by plants in photosynthesis. However we produce more CO2 than can be absorbed naturally as part of the carbon cycle, hence why atmospheric CO2 levels have risen to the highest point measured for 800,000 years. Most everyday items contain carbon, usually as plastics - computers, medicines, cars, clothes, buildings. Most of this carbon originates from petroleum or coal, fossil fuels buried underground for millions of years. We could extract the carbon from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere instead, but this presents scientific and engineering challenges. The predominant view is that CO2 is a waste product, and a polluting one at that, even though small amounts are used to carbonate fizzy drinks, or to make urea or useful industrial solvents. But because of our fossil fuel energy use, we have large amounts of CO2 available that could be put to better use as a resource. This could be done without disrupting the natural carbon cycle, while reusing the carbon to create new products would also decrease fossil fuel use. CO2 can be captured from industrial sources such as power plants, steel or cement works, or collected from the air. Then using chemical processes, scientists can extract the carbon from the mix of gases and particles, providing the raw material for new products. Among the products underway are green fuels, methanol, memory foams, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cement and building materials all from “waste” CO2. The process requires chemical catalysts to react with the CO2, but the energy required could be provided by renewables, so the process could be carbon negative.  This is called Carbon Dioxide Utilisation, or CDU. Ideally, in the future many useful products will be made using waste CO2. The use of CO2 as a feedstock raw material for new products is not a new idea, and has been the focus of research  for 40 years. While some of the products are currently being widely tested and will be on the market in the next few years, others are still in the lab. But the range of products that can be produced from CO2 is vast. The choice of what gets manufactured depends on the ability to source cheap, renewable energy to power the chemical process, geographic location, and market demand for the product. For example, methanol is a key commodity chemical produced from CO2, and Carbon Recycling International in Iceland and Mitsui Chemicals in Japan are two companies with facilities producing methanol. In Iceland, CRI take advantage of the country’s geothermal power to produce 50,000 litres of methanol per year, which is blended with petrol as a fuel. Mitsui’s methanol is synthesised using exhaust gases from their ethylene production plant and hydrogen produced from water. The company’s aim is to eventually capture and convert 100% of its CO2 emissions to methanol, making the plant carbon neutral. The US firm Novomer and Bayer MaterialScience in Germany use the CDU process to create plastics. Novomer creates high-performance polymers that are 50% recycled CO2, which are used by other firms to manufacture plastic bottles, films and laminates. Novomer’s CO2 stream is the waste gases from creating ethanol, using a cobalt catalyst that maximises the amount of CO2 is re-used. Bayer’s so-called “Dream Process” produces polyurethane memory foams using CO2 captured from from RWE’s coal-fired power station in Niederaussem. Bayer intends to bring its first products to market in 2015. The scientific and engineering challenges of CO2 utilisation are substantial, but the potential benefits are as large, or larger. If we can solve these challenges and streamline the process and lower costs, CDU could completely reinvent a chemicals industry that is tied to fossil fuel and petroleum feedstocks. This would provide us with a secure source of chemical raw materials for the future, and in doing so would not only reduce the industry’s carbon emissions, but provide a means to safely turn the carbon dioxide warming the atmosphere into useful products."

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
“Research is the process of going up alleys to see if they are blind.”
Marston Bates
A friend was doing research on a climate topic peripheral to his normal research. He had difficulty finding information, especially data, so asked for some links. He thought it was his inexperience or unfamiliarity with the subject that created his difficulties. He confronted the nemesis of too much modern research, namely the need for positive results. It is parallel to the question frequently asked after I make a public presentation. How come we haven’t heard any of this before? The answer is, “Ask yourself that question.” The information exists, so either you did not know where to look, or someone did not want you to know? Or, the data doesn’t exist or is inadequate for the claims made, and there is no basis for the proposed policies.
Western society and science are imbued, to its detriment, with the need for positive results. It likely began with the policy of students not failing in school. I became fully aware of this problem in research when talking with a colleague doing a doctorate in mathematics at Oxford. He obtained his early degrees, started his doctorate but took a university job before its completion. He continued work on it because, as I understand, it involved creating a new theorem. He worked for two years on two possible solutions and then, during the summer, returned to Oxford for discussion with his supervisor. Remember, this in pre-internet and email days.
His supervisor told him the names of others who he knew attempted the same solutions, but with no success. Possibly closer communication could have resolved this problem, but what if the supervisor was not personally familiar with the people involved. My colleague asked why this wasn’t recorded somewhere; surely some good can emerge from negative results? How much unnecessary research is done because negative results are not recorded?
The issue of negative results is integral to the scientific method. You seek one result, but skeptical research yields a different answer – the null hypothesis. But how often is that ignored in today’s research? Proper skeptical testing of the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis has produced the null hypothesis. Not only is it ignored, but those who dare to pursue it are branded skeptics and deniers. Witness the latest such attack in the Madhouse Effect. The image at right shows the back cover with its interesting and edifying list of promoters and their comments. Jane Lubchenko is the only person on the list at least peripherally qualified in climate science, but that is compromised by the political appointment by the Obama White House as Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere.
 
A classic and traditional requirement of research and publications was a review of the literature. Today, most papers, for a multitude of invalid reasons, do not require this essential context. This means most research is done without the onus of explaining how it is a continuum of understanding and builds on previous knowledge. Sir Isaac Newton understood this when he said he saw so far because he was standing on the shoulders of others.
Another example of the obsession with positive results was the constant questions I had from students about essay (research papers) topics. At the start of a course, the students don’t know enough to identify the concerns or issues on the subject. I provided a list of possible topics, although a student could pursue their own. As part of my pedagogic trickery I deliberately included topics of concern knowing there was very little information. Two common feedbacks occurred. They asked to modify the topic, or they said they could not find anything in the library or, latterly, on the internet. Ironically, a major problem was the same in both cases. They were not asking the right questions. We are now familiar with the restrictions keyword research puts on the answers you get; just ask Naomi Oreskes.
The discussion with individual students and later broached with the entire class involved the following.

Was the failure to find material because you were asking the wrong questions?
Was it because there was little or no material on the subject?
Was there no material because it was being avoided?
Was there no material because there was no issue or concern?

Answers to all these questions are the potential topic for papers. They also speak to the failure to instruct students in the mechanics and methods of research. Two people working to improve this at the university level at least are Kesten Green and J.S Armstrong. Armstrong has the benefit for climate research of science degrees and application in business, models, and forecasting.
“When we inspected the 17 [forecasting] articles, we found that none of them referred to the scientific literature on forecasting methods. It is difficult to understand how scientific forecasting could be conducted without reference to the research literature on how to make forecasts. One would expect to see empirical justification for the forecasting methods that were used. We concluded that climate forecasts are informed by the modelers’ experience and by their models—but that they are unaided by the application of forecasting principles.”
To some extent the failure to publish negative results was understandable before the advent of the computer or the internet, now there is no excuse. Of course, excuses will develop because publishing negative results does not fit the culture, but more important funding agencies only pay for positive results. It is directed funding.
The influence of funding in climate science is well documented. It is equally unbalanced to the negative because government and environmentalists funding is considered positive and other funding is negative. There is great pressure to produce positive results for funding. Imagine getting funding for a project you propose. The funder provides the money assuming you are going to provide what you promise. Upton Sinclair said
“It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!”
That is likely twice as true for research funding. It is also twice as true for a bureaucratic job when your political boss bases public policy and political persona on what you told them.
Possibly the biggest obsession with positive results regarding the damage created is the failure of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to consider the null hypothesis when the evidence showed the hypothesis was wrong. The word null is misleading, often interpreted to mean negative. It means that your hypothesis was not proved and therefore an alternative hypothesis must be considered. Because of the political use of the AGW hypothesis, the testing had to produce a positive result. This meant a null hypothesis became negative and could never be entertained. The IPCC still pursues that objective. It is the basis of such claims as the consensus and “the science is settled.”
A classic example of proper research occurred in the production of Elaine Dewar’s book Cloak of Green. It is one of the most revealing books about the machinations of Canadian environmentalists and politicians. Dewar started with the hypothesis that all these people are noble with good causes and a desire to save the planet. The thorough research included extensive interviews with all of them. This included Maurice Strong, the architect of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Agenda 21, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the IPCC. After the research was complete Dewar realized the hypothesis was not proved. In fact, the opposite or null hypothesis was true. These people had political, personal, and profit agendas greater than those they attacked. That is how all research, scientific or otherwise, must be done. Rarely is it the case in officially funded climate science.
All of the trends and events discussed are part of the demise of science, especially climate science. Those of us who tried to protest were marginalized by attacks such as those in the Madhouse Effect supported by people who are blinded by a misrepresented noble cause. Only when a person, such as my friend from outside of climate science, begins to investigate are the full corruption and damage of the obsession with positive results exposed.

Speaking before an audience of journalists in Aspen last week, the former Veep called B.S. on a number of assertions often made about climate change. Since then, there’s been a lot of the typically polarizing blather that Gore both decries and commits, but not a lot of hard analysis of his claims and rhetoric.



The speech was vintage Gore, with ambiguous grammar making it very hard to understand what he really said. I invite readers to grade the six assertions he made, and you will find that it’s pretty subjective. If you’re old‐​school and allow for no wiggle room, he flunks. If you give partial credit, he may do very well, depending on your reading of what he really meant. Give it a try.



You can hear the 1:15 minute audio of his litany here. The first B.S. call is on people who say “man‐​made CO2 doesn’t trap heat.” Unlike what follows, this is a clear, declarative statement, and he’s right. I don’t know who of us cringes more when we hear that carbon dioxide isn’t a greenhouse gas.



But things soon get murkier. The next words are: “It may be volcanoes [expletive].” Strictly speaking, the antecedent to “it” is what “traps heat.” Anyone who says that volcanoes are more responsible than man for increasing carbon dioxide is stating an easily testable hypothesis. There should be a jump in atmospheric CO2 after a big eruption. Not. If that’s what he meant, it’s B.S.



But “it“s not exactly clear what Gore is referring to. If “it” is generic for volcanoes being a factor involved in global warming, that’s not BS. Just look at today’s issue of _Science_ , where Susan Solomon provides evidence that about a third of the post‐​1998 warming predicted by models that don’t factor in volcanoes (i.e. almost all of them) is in fact being prevented by them.



This becomes the grader’s call. I’ll give Al half credit.



Next comes “it may be sunspots [expletive].” Judith Lean and David Rind, two scientists of Gore’s preference, recently calculated the contribution of a standard sunspot cycle to climate. Going from a maximum, which we were in during the late 1990s, to a minimum, where we are near now, cools things about a tenth of a degree. That’s certainly explanatory for the last decade but not nearly sufficient to explain the past century. Nicola Scafetta from Duke thinks the solar contribution may be three times larger.



And if Gore means solar modulation of warming in general, there’s a research thread emerging that cosmic ray fluxes, which are modified by solar activity, can influence cloudiness and therefore climate. While I am personally very skeptical of this, it’s obvious that there is just too much conflict out there to call B.S. on anyone who says the sun is important. Half credit again.



This section then ends with “it’s not getting warmer [expletive]”. That depends on your time frame. If you choose to look at the last 15 years, it’s not B.S. If you go back to 1976, when the second warming of the 20th century started, it is. Too murky to call B.S., too unclear to not do so. Another half‐​credit.



At this point the wheels come off his wagon. Consider his words (emphasis added) “ _There is no longer_ a shared reality on an issue like climate.”



What does he mean? Did everyone once agree that fighting climate change should be, as he wrote in _Earth in the Balance_ , “the central organizing principal for civilization”? Clearly not. (Citation: Nov. 7, 2000). Is there a shared scientific reality about the magnitude of future climate change caused by human activity? Heck no.



Everyone, on the spectrum from the United Nations to MIT’s Richard Lindzen, acknowledges that the magnitude of future warming is uncertain because of the unknown true “sensitivity” of surface temperature to carbon dioxide changes. This is highly dependent upon how much warming self‐​amplifies or self‐​damps, and how efficiently the earth dissipates excess heat to space. Wrong because of improper premise.



Finally, the corker, that “the very existence of our civilization is threatened” by climate change. If this were a graduate student paper, I would write, “citation, please?” “Civilization” is a big word, as in “Greek” or “Roman”, and I think “our” means “Western”, which is remarkably insensitive to environmental disaster and change. The worst weather imaginable boggles GDP by a couple of tenths of a percent. On a planet that was about a degree (C) cooler, life expectancy in our civilization was half of what it is today. The overwhelming evidence is that people in vibrant economies adapt to, or, like Gore himself, profit from change. How much did he make on his carbon‐​trading business? What’s his speaking fee? Wrong on the merits.



So, in six B.S.-related assertions, Gore got one absolutely right, got half‐​credit for three others, and two wrong. A lot of points were lost because he did not define his time frame and used a very ambiguous pronoun. That may have been unintentional, given that his remarks were unscripted. But while it affected my grading, I’m interested in what others have to say.

Thousands of children became heavily involved in Hong Kong's pro-democracy push last year.
Some 1,600 were arrested for joining the sometimes violent demonstrations.
The order came on the same day that a new national Chinese security office opened in the city.
The office is one element of a sweeping new law that makes inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government illegal.
The law has caused alarm in Hong Kong, with opponents saying it erodes the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. But officials say it will restore stability after violent protests.
Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 and certain rights were supposed to be guaranteed for at least 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.
Last year hundreds and thousands protested for weeks in Hong Kong against an extradition bill that critics said undermined the city's special status.
The anti-government movement's demands broadened to include full democracy and an inquiry into police brutality.
In schools many children expressed their support for the demonstrations by drowning out the Chinese national anthem with protest song Glory To Hong Kong.
Now Education Minister Kevin Yeung says schools must stamp out such demonstrations.
Mr Yeung said the song Glory to Hong Kong was ""closely related to the social and political incidents, violence and illegal incidents that have lasted for months,"" according to Reuters news agency.
""Schools must not allow students to play, sing or broadcast it in schools,"" he said.
Additionally authorities said students must not form human chains, chant slogans or express other political messages.
Last week pro-democracy books were removed from public libraries, and authorities say they will be reviewed to see if they violate the new law."
"**China's new security law for Hong Kong envisages setting up an office in the territory to gather intelligence and handle crimes against national security, state media say.**
The new security law will also override any local laws that conflict with it, Xinhua news agency reported.
The planned law has sparked protests and drawn international condemnation.
Critics say it will destroy the freedoms Hong Kong enjoys but which are not available in mainland China.
On Friday the European Parliament voted to take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if the law was imposed.
But China says the law is needed to tackle separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign elements and rejects criticism a interference in its affairs.
Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997 under an agreement centring on a ""one country, two systems"" principle that guaranteed certain freedoms for Hong Kong and that do not apply in the mainland.
Details were published after a three-day meeting of the main decision-making body in China's parliament, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
A new national security office in Hong Kong would deal with national security cases, but would also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools.
Xinhua also said that Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam would be able to appoint specific judges to hear national security cases.
Ms Lam has backed the proposed law and has denied that Hong Kong's freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" will be affected.
The Hong Kong government will be required to carry out most enforcement under the new law, but Beijing will be able to overrule the Hong Kong authorities in some cases.
""If the local laws... are inconsistent with this Law, the provisions of this Law shall apply. The power to interpret this law belongs to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,"" Xinhua said.
The process of creating and finalising legislation in China usually takes some years, BBC Reality Check's Wanyuan Song says, with one law for Taiwan taking five years to pass from when it was first proposed.
But state media says the new security law planned for Hong Kong could be published this summer, although it was proposed just a few months ago, she adds.
**By Celia Hatton, Asia-Pacific editor, BBC News**
In one short but powerful document, Beijing initiated the most dramatic changes to Hong Kong's power structure since the territory was handed back from Britain in 1997.
The new law says unequivocally that it will override any divergent legislation in Hong Kong, effectively wiping out the Chinese territory's own body of laws and regulations.
Chinese leaders contend the law will target only a handful of terrorists and separatists, but key details have yet to be released: namely, what falls under the umbrella of national security and what constitutes a crime.
The legislation won't be imposed without a fight: many in Hong Kong are fiercely opposed to the law, fearing it will erase their existing freedoms. And if the national security law does become a reality, Beijing faces international ramifications.
The US says the law means Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to merit special treatment under US law.
This potentially paves the way for Hong Kong to be stripped of trading privileges, such as lower tariffs, meaning that the US would treat it the same as any other mainland Chinese city for trading purposes.
Meanwhile the UK says it will change its immigration rules and offer millions of people in Hong Kong ""a route to citizenship"" if China imposes the new law.
The 1997 handover agreement between the UK and China - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called ""one country, two systems"" principle - envisages Hong Kong rights that include freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights which no other part of mainland China has.
Under the same agreement, Hong Kong is expected to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law.
But its unpopularity means it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests.
Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement.
China doesn't want to see that happen again."
"It was the year 1799, during the “Dalton Minimum” when the sun was quiet that George Frederick Bollinger led a group of early pioneers from North Carolina to establish early settlements in Missouri. They hoped to cross their largest obstacle, the Mississippi River, on the ice, frozen solid in mid-winter.
The pioneers and their wagon train moved westward a few miles each day, making and breaking camp each night, fording the small streams and floating across the larger ones on rafts which they made from the nearby trees, following roads that were barely trails through forests and valleys.
They arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River opposite St. Genevieve in late December, pitched camp and explored potential river crossings. St. Genevieve is located about a 100 miles downstream from St. Louis. Winter had come early and the Mississippi river was already covered with ice. It was bitterly cold. They determined the ice was not yet thick enough to support a crossing of ox-carts and covered wagons. Daily the thickness of the ice was measured and then on Dec. 31, a chopped hole in the ice indicated thickness well over two feet. They tested the ice by making a few trips across on foot and horseback. The believed the ice was thick enough to support a loaded wagon.
As a test, a wagon was selected to be driven across with no one riding and the driver would walk ahead watching the ice and leading his team. The trip across and back to camp was made without the ice cracking and preparations were made for an early crossing New Year’s Day.
The next morning final preparations were made to break camp and all supplies were loaded. The weather remained bitter cold with dark skies overhead and light snow falling, but the decision had been made to cross and there was no turning back. The group was devout German Reformed Protestants and they gathered together in the early cold gray dawn to seek guidance from their God for a safe crossing.
The cracking of whips like pistol shots rang out over the heads of the oxen to coax them out onto the ice; the crossing had began. All that were able, walked to lighten the loaded wagons, keeping a safe distance from the wagons, which were also spaced far apart to lessen the danger of breaking the ice. The crossing was made successfully with no mishaps, except extremely cold hands and feet.
The townsfolk of St. Genevieve had built a large fire to welcome and warm these new settlers. Safely across the Mississippi, they were relieved of their crossing fears and enjoyed the local hospitality. They exchanged news from the East for information of what they might expect ahead. Needed supplies were purchased and even the weather abated a little as the sun broke through the clouds. They settled along the Whitewater River where the soil was rich.
We are transitioning into Solar Cycle (SC) 24 and the sun has become fairly quiet. During most of the last century (SC 16-23) the sun has been in a Grand Maxima. As a result the Earth has experienced warming. But with SC 24 the sun is again changing states. From the peak year 1998, the lower Troposphere temperatures globally have already fallen around 1/2 degree Celsius. This is despite the fact that during that same time period, atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen 5% from 367 ppm to 386 ppm. Several solar scientist are predicting the sun will slide into a “Dalton Minimum” event in SC 25, about a decade from now. If that happens, the Earth will experience some bitterly cold winters for several decades.
The winters may once again resemble the winters 200 years ago during the time of the early pioneers. Imagine for a minute the west fork of the White River near Bloomfield freezing into a block of ice two feet thick.

"When Yordano Ventura won Game 6 of the 2014 World Series for the Kansas City Royals, he wore the initials of Oscar Taveras on his cap. Taveras, an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, had just been killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic, the homeland they shared. Early Sunday morning, Ventura was killed in a car accident there at 25. Andy Marte, 33, a former infielder who spent parts of seven seasons with Atlanta, Cleveland and Arizona, was killed in another car crash Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Major League Baseball announced the deaths on its social media accounts. The traffic authorities in the Dominican Republic said that it was not clear whether Ventura had been driving when he died on a highway about 40 miles northwest of the capital, Santo Domingo. Marte died when the   he was driving hit a house about 95 miles north of Santo Domingo, the authorities said. Ventura was a     who reached the majors in September 2013 and seemed destined to stay for many years. He had a record of   with a 3. 89 earned run average, and he was part of the team’s core, with a $23 million contract that could have bound him to Kansas City through 2021. “I love you my brother,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer wrote on Instagram, sharing a photograph of himself with Ventura. “I’m in disbelief and don’t know what to say. I love you ACE. ” Only one qualified starting pitcher, the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard, had a harder average fastball last season than Ventura’s Syndergaard’s averaged 97. 9 miles per hour, Ventura’s 96. 1 m. p. h. Ventura made three World Series starts, two in 2014 against the San Francisco Giants, and then a loss to the Mets at Citi Field in 2015. He gained a measure of notoriety last season when he was suspended for eight games for hitting Baltimore’s Manny Machado in the back with a fastball, inciting a brawl. Ventura was   with a 4. 45 E. R. A. in his final season. Marte spent the past two seasons playing professionally in South Korea. Once a promising prospect for the Braves, he was traded to Boston for Edgar Renteria in 2005, and he was then quickly sent to Cleveland in a multiplayer deal that brought Coco Crisp to the Red Sox. Marte played 278 of his 308 career games with the Indians, and batted . 218, with 21 homers and 99 runs batted in, over all. “He was a genuine person who always greeted you with a warm smile,” the Indians wrote on Twitter. Tony Clark, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said in a statement: “It’s never easy to lose a member of our fraternity, and there are no words to describe the feeling of losing two young men in the prime of their lives. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families, friends, teammates and fans throughout the United States and Latin America. ” The Dominican Republic’s president, Danilo Medina, posted on Twitter that the nation “is dressed in mourning with the deaths of Andy Marte and Yordano Ventura, great sportsmen who raised high our national banner. ” Fans began arriving at Kansas City’s Kauffman Stadium shortly after Ventura’s death was announced, leaving flowers, hats and other mementos outside. Flags at the ballpark were lowered to  . A 2015 study by the World Health Organization found that the Dominican Republic had the highest traffic accident death rate in the Americas, 29. 3 per 100, 000 inhabitants. The deaths of Ventura and Marte follow the death of another major leaguer, the Miami Marlins’   pitcher Jose Fernandez, in a boating accident in September."

As I’ve written before, the Morrison government’s plans for a royal commission into Australia’s bushfire disaster this summer is fraught with potential problems. Not least is that unscrupulous climate activists will turn it into a bully pulpit for their hysterics.



Another potential roadblock is that those with potentially the most to fear from what the royal commission will find will attempt to derail the whole thing.



The Victorian government is withholding support for **Scott Morrison’** s black summer bushfire royal commission, threatening the credibility of the inquiry and a nationally co-ordinated approach to natural disasters. Constitutional lawyers said a refusal by a state to participate in the royal commission could prevent Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, who will lead the inquiry, from accessing that state’s documents and compelling high-level public servants to give evidence.



Victoria is apparently standing alone in its obstructionism.



NSW and South Australia have already issued letters patent while Queensland and Western Australia have signed up and begun processes to deliver their letters patent as requested.



But Victorian Premier **Daniel Andrews’** s spokesman said: “We continue to consider Victoria’s involvement in the federal bushfire royal commission.”



So, what’s Andrews’s excuse?



Mr Andrews is concerned about the encroachment of commonwealth powers into areas of state responsibility.



Mr Morrison has asked the commission to look at whether the commonwealth should be able to declare a state of national emergency and be given clearer authority to take action.



This may be a legitimate concern for the states. On the other hand, the commonwealth is rightly concerned that the states dragged their heels in the face of the gathering disaster, while the commonwealth was falsely blamed. Media and social media loudmouths who shrieked that the commonwealth should “send in the army” were either ignorant or chose to ignore the fact that the commonwealth **can’t** do that unless specifically requested by the states.



Victoria waited until thousands were trapped on the beaches at Mallacoota before it requested the commonwealth’s help.



There’s also another danger for Andrews in the royal commission.



[Mr Morrison] has also said hazard reduction, native vegetation management, building standards and planning laws should remain a state responsibility, but called for “national consistency” after the bushfires burned through states along the east coast.



None of the state governments has much to be proud of when it comes to hazard reduction and vegetation management. Hazard reduction works in NSW have been progressively scaled back. But Victoria is perhaps the most egregious failure. Its own commission in 2009 [ruled that](http://royalcommission.vic.gov.au/finaldocuments/summary/PF/VBRC_Summary_PF.pdf) “prescribed burning is one of the main tools for fire management on public land”.



Yet Victoria has never, once, met the hazard reduction targets prescribed by the Black Saturday commission. Worse, it has consistently failed to meet even its own targets, which were all well below those recommended by the commission.



 **It’s almost as if Daniel Andrews is afraid of what a bushfire royal commission will find.**

 **Andrew Breitbart** coined the maxim that “politics is downstream from culture”. If you want to see the future of left-wing politics, you only need look at the culture on university campuses.



It doesn’t look good.



How much longer can univer­sity leaders ignore the accelerating rhythm to raids on free speech at Australian universities? Today, the most brazen opponents of free speech within universities are those who control student unions.



It’s hardly surprising that the political left screamed blue murder when the Howard government passed its Voluntary Student Unionism bill – or that the Gillard government rushed to overturn it. **Student unionism is a cash-cow for aspiring leftist politicians, where students are forced to fork out hundreds of dollars every year** – most of which goes straight into the pockets of student associations wholly run by the left.



And they’re making sure it stays that way by shutting down anyone who might challenge their privilege.



On Tuesday afternoon, the student association at Melbourne’s Monash University, which runs Orientation Week stalls, BBQs and other events aimed at offering students “a diverse introduction to Monash”, rejected an application from Generation Liberty to be part of the program’s activities.



Generation Liberty is a program run by the Institute of Public Affairs for young Australians, includi­ng university students, introduc­ing them to ideas, arguments, and perspectives that they may have missed at school or university. The program is a big hit; its growth, especially over the past 12 months, points to a real hunger for knowledge not addressed by schools and universities.



In an email, events officer **Michel­e Fredregill** from the Monash­ Student Association told fellow Monash student **Luca Rossi** , a Generation Liberty co-ordina­tor at the university: “We have carefully reviewed your booking request and discussed it internally. Regretfully we must decline your booking application on the basis of our terms and conditions. Generation Liberty’s positions on issues such as climate change do not align with MSA’s.”



In Victoria, where Monash (my alma mater, I’m ashamed to admit) is located, a prima facie case can be made that this violates the state’s Equal Opportunity Act 2010: **“In Victoria it is against the law for someone to discriminate against you because of your political beliefs or activities, or what people think these might be”**.



Stud­ent unions are baying campus censors, too. And it takes only a handful of students who control events such as Market Week at QUT and O-Week at Monash to undermine intellectual diversity for the rest of the student popul­ation. IPA research compiled last year revealed that 59 per cent of students believe they are sometimes prevented from voicing their opinions on controversial issues by other students.



This mirrors my anecdotal experience. Many students have told me that they don’t dare state their real opinions, because they know full well that they will be shouted down by other students and, more disgustingly, **marked down by lecturers**.



But if anyone is expecting university administrators to step up and force left-wing student associations to **actually obey the law** , they’re sadly mistaken.



It is a stark failure of logic and leadership when VCs try to dodge responsibility by saying stud­ent unions are “independent” from university administration[..]Who then, if not university ­administrators, will hold these stud­ent censors to account?



It is not unreasonable for VCs, acting on behalf of all students, to require students within student unions or guilds to commit, in practice, to freedom of expression, open debate and intellectual diversity. That starts with O-Week ­activities.



Instead, there is a failure of accounta­bility right up and down the line.



[Universities are failing students](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/universities-are-failing-their-students-and-australia/), the wider community, and undermining their _raison d’être_ , at every turn. Students are being short-changed, bullied and oppressed. The community is being ripped off to the tune of $30 billion a year by what now amounts to little more than left-wing indoctrination camps and middle-management job creation schemes. Universities are betraying the Western intellectual tradition they are supposed to uphold.



When I recently suggested [bulldozing the universities](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/time-to-bulldoze-the-universities/), I was half-joking. Now, it’s a quarter-joke, at best.



Fire up the D9s, fellas. There’s work to do.

"THE decorations have been put away, and mailboxes are now filling with credit card bills instead of holiday cards. If you binged on gifts and entertainment in December and your card balances are higher than you were expecting, it’s important to make a plan to pay down the debt as quickly as possible, credit experts say. “Don’t put those bills aside, thinking they’ll look better if you come back to them later,” said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. When it comes to paying down   card debt, he said, “time is not your friend. ” If you have sound credit but got a bit carried away with   spending, you may want to consider transferring your balances to a   credit card. Zero percent balance transfer offers allow you to affordably pay the debt over time, and some cards are offering people with healthy credit scores terms as long as 12 to 21 months, said Nick Clements, a   of MagnifyMoney. The catch, he said, is that consumers must be disciplined and make the payments on time, or they risk losing the promotional offer. That means they will be back to paying   interest rates. Also, he said, try to find a card that doesn’t charge a transfer fee, which often is 3 to 4 percent of the balance being transferred. If you have a large balance, you may not be able to transfer the full amount, depending on the new card’s credit limit. But, he noted, you can save money by transferring even part of the debt to a 0 percent card. Another option that is becoming more common, Mr. Clements said, is a personal loan, often made by online lenders or, increasingly, traditional banks. The loans are unsecured, just like the debt from a credit card, but they have a fixed repayment term  —   typically three to five years. Some lenders will make loans for larger amounts, and interest rates can be as low as 5 or 6 percent for borrowers with good credit. But Mr. Clements cautioned that the loans might have upfront fees and, because they are   loans, borrowers must make uniform monthly payments. Borrowers can’t fall back on making low “minimum” payments, as they can with a credit card if money gets tight. “That flexibility goes away,” he said. Also, rates will be higher for those with    credit. So you will need to compare the rate on your card with the loan rate to see if you will actually save money. Often, he said, borrowers can check their potential rate without having the inquiry affect their credit report. To help keep card balances from getting out of hand in the first place, Julie Pukas, head of United States bank card and merchant services at TD Bank, suggests that cardholders make use of text or email alerts to notify them when their spending is approaching their credit limit, when their balance reaches a certain limit or when a payment is due. “They can help get control of their accounts just by receiving reminders,” she said. Ms. Pukas also suggested that cardholders using rewards programs check to see if they can receive their points or   rewards as a credit on their card statement to help pay down their balance. Bill Hardekopf, the chief executive of LowCards. com, recommended that consumers try making micropayments over the course of a month, rather than waiting until the account due date to make a   payment. If you have extra cash, you can make a payment at any time and reduce the interest you will pay if you carry a balance, he said. Here are some questions and answers about paying off credit cards: What credit cards currently offer 0 percent interest without a transfer fee? Chase Slate offers 15 months at 0 percent without a transfer fee, and some credit unions offer 12 months with no transfer fee, Mr. Clements said. Other cards have relatively low balance transfer fees of 3 percent and lengthy terms: Citibank’s Simplicity card offers 21 months, and Discover It offers 18 months. What is the best way to pay off multiple credit cards? One way is to list all your cards, in order of highest interest rate to lowest, regardless of the balance. You put all of your extra cash toward paying down the first card balance, then move down the list until all are paid off. (You must continue making at least the minimum monthly payment on all the cards, to keep them in good standing.) The thinking with this ladder method is that paying off the most costly debt first saves you money. But some consumers with multiple cards may do better paying off the smallest balance first. Most people don’t even know what the interest rates are on their various cards (the average consumer has four) and the rates on cards held by a single consumer tend to be similar, since they are based on one’s credit score, said Remi Trudel, assistant professor of marketing at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. He and several colleagues recently published a study suggesting that paying off the card with the smallest debt first provides a feeling of accomplishment and encourages consumers to keep going and pay off more debt. “It’s more motivating,” he said. Once I pay off a card balance, should I close the account? Ms. Pukas of TD Bank says she generally doesn’t recommend closing card accounts, since doing so may actually harm your credit score. (Closing an account can affect your utilization score, a measure of how much credit you have available.) Rather, she suggests putting the card aside in a drawer for safekeeping."
"Protein is a shrinking part of the diets of humans and animals. The deficiency is spreading rapidly across the world, but is particularly pronounced in Africa, even though many sources of protein can be found there. What the UN calls Non-Wood Forest Products include a group of foods that can help to ensure global food security. Nuts, berries, plants like moringa - the vitamin-rich, so-called “miracle tree” - and also edible insects all provide a boost to dietary protein in a way that countries elsewhere in Africa and the world could learn from. As global demand for meat grows it becomes increasingly important to find higher yield food sources that are both nutritious and environmentally sound. Producing them produces fewer greenhouse gases than rearing livestock or poultry. Terrestrial vertebrates such as cattle have always been part of daily life or humans, providing food in times of plenty and in famine. But invertebrates such as insects have a place in that history too. As far back as the days of the Old Testament, Moses told the Hebrews: “Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.” So since the time of our ancestors, insects have been part of the human diet and oral tradition, one of the foods that can sometimes replace meat in households. In modern times they have even made a reappearance as part of the Paleo diet – which supposedly replicates the eating habits of cavemen – and will be vital in the future. In Africa, insects feature regularly in the diets of people living in both rural and urban areas. Crickets are popular in Niger, caterpillars are enjoyed in the Central African Republic and Congo, and winged termites are eaten in many countries. Several species of weevil are much sought after and can fetch high prices in urban markets. Evidence gathered in the field shows that at least 23 species of insect are eaten.  But deforestation and global changes mean that there are fewer and fewer to harvest from the wild. Some species are becoming rare and others are threatened with extinction. So it’s vital to continue to carry out inventories of edible species, establish through biochemical analysis their nutritional quality, and to start trying to rear them commercially as foodstuffs."

One of the nation’s leading scientists Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama reports at his website that 7 shots were fired at the National Space Science and Technology Center in Huntsville Alabama, all hitting the fourth floor where the office of renowned pioneering climate scientist Prof. John Christy is located.

Target of brazen intimidation, or worse? Huntsville Alabama National Space Science and Technology Center climate science critical researchers Prof. John Christy and Dr. Roy Spencer may have been the targets of gunshots.
It is suspected that the shots were fired over the weekend during the “March for Science” demonstration. Dr. Spencer’s office is located in another part of the same building.
“I think this is more than a coincidence,” Spencer wrote at his site.
Both Spencer and Christy have been outspoken critics of the climate science alarmism often spread by alarmist scientists, militant environmental activists and mass media.
For years they and a number of researchers have claimed that the models have severely exaggerated the projected warming by greenhouse gases emitted by man and that observations over the past 20 years for the most part refute the theory.
A shaken Spencer writes at his site:
A total of seven shots were fired into our National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) building here at UAH over the weekend.
All bullets hit the 4th floor, which is where John Christy’s office is (my office is in another part of the building).

Given that this was Earth Day weekend, with a March for Science passing right past our building on Saturday afternoon, I think this is more than coincidence. When some people cannot argue facts, they resort to violence to get their way. It doesn’t matter that we don’t “deny global warming”; the fact we disagree with its seriousness and the level of human involvment in warming is enough to send some radicals into a tizzy.
Our street is fairly quiet, so I doubt the shots were fired during Saturday’s march here. It was probably late night Saturday or Sunday for the shooter to have a chance of being unnoticed.
Maybe the “March For Science” should have been called the “March To Silence”.
Campus and city police say they believe the shots were fired from a passing car, based upon the angle of entry into one of the offices. Shell casings were recovered outside.
This is a developing story. I have no other details.”
If indeed targeted, the level of violence aimed at shutting down scientific dissent and open debate reaches a whole dimension. Scientists with dissenting views on climate must now fear life-threatening hostility and psychological intimidation that up to now has been unprecendeted in the USA — a nation that has traditionally prided itself in its freedom of speech, open debate and alternative ideas.
Skeptics of alarmist scientists have long been the target of harsh rhetoric from hostile climate alarmist parties, who often refer to scientists such as Spencer and Christy as “climate deniers”, a thinly veiled reference to Holocaust deniers.
Harvard astrophysicist Prof. Willie Soon, also an otspoken critic of climate science alarmism, has also felt firsthand vicious attacks from both colleagues and militant alarmists. In an e-mail comment, he like Dr. Spencer also called the shots more more than just a “coincidence”, and characterized last weekend’s March for Science” demonstration as a political charade.
“The whole ‘March for Science’ movement during the weekend proves how ill climate science has become today,” Soon wrote. “This incidence of shooting into Professor John Christy’s and Dr. Roy Spencer’s office building is an act of violent intent and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible. Those anti-science cowards have not only lost their grounding in science, but clearly have also bankrupted their moral currency.”
Not long ago a University of Graz Professor called for the death penalty for scientists who did not agree with the visions of alarmist climate scientists, who have dominated the media and public scene with scare stories of super-storms and Biblical sea level rise for 15 years. While the professor’s harsh rhetoric was viewed as bizarre, it now totally pales compared to the 7 gunshots in Huntsville.
Joe Bast, spokesman of the U.S. think tank Heartland Institute in a comment by e-mail: “We should take this threat seriously, and all of us should take precautions in our professional and personal lives.”

"WASHINGTON  —   Several Republican senators on Monday proposed a partial replacement for the Affordable Care Act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose, a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former President Barack Obama’s signature health law. But the plan was attacked by Democrats as a step back from the Affordable Care Act’s protections, and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative Republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible. If anything, the proposal  —   by Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, and Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican  —   may show how difficult it will be for Republicans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Legislation that can pass muster in the more conservative House may not win enough support in the Senate. A bill with broad appeal in the Senate may fail in the House. Under the proposal, states could stay with the Affordable Care Act, or they could receive a similar amount of federal money, which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance. “We are moving the locus of repeal to state government,” Mr. Cassidy said. “States should have the right to choose. ” The proposal shares some features with House Republican proposals: It would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and eliminate the requirement for most Americans to have insurance or pay a tax penalty. But the option for states to keep the Affordable Care Act alive will rankle the most conservative Republicans who have been trying for nearly seven years to blow it up. “Obamacare is flawed, failing and not fixable, and it needs to be fully repealed,” said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. A stalemate between the House and Senate would leave in place Mr. Obama’s health law, but efforts by President Trump and Congress to undermine it could send health insurance markets into a tailspin. On Friday, as one of his first official acts as president, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that could allow officials to ease up on enforcement of the mandate requiring most Americans to have insurance. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act panned the   proposal. “Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans,    costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket, and protections for people with   conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted,” said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York. Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a   consumer group, said the bill “falls way short of providing the protections and coverage people have under the Affordable Care Act. ” Ms. Collins said the bill would allow states to “keep the Affordable Care Act if it is working for their residents. ” But she predicted that most states would choose something different. Under the   bill, states could enroll people who would otherwise be uninsured in health plans providing basic coverage. These   health plans are intended to protect consumers against catastrophic medical expenses. They would cover generic versions of prescription drugs, and they would also have to cover recommended childhood immunizations without  . States would contract with one or more insurers to offer this coverage. Consumers could buy “more robust coverage” if they want, Mr. Cassidy said, but they could be automatically enrolled, by default, in the   health plans providing basic coverage. “A state could say, ‘All those eligible are enrolled unless they choose not to be,’” he explained. This “passive enrollment” would provide insurers with a large pool of customers, including many healthy people, without the coercion of an “individual mandate,” Mr. Cassidy said. “We think that we could cover more people than Obamacare,” Mr. Cassidy said, although he acknowledged that the effects of his bill had not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, which serves as Capitol Hill’s official scorekeeper. If a state opts out of the Affordable Care Act, many of the federal insurance standards established under the law would no longer apply. The bill would repeal federal benefit mandates that “often force Americans to pay for coverage they don’t need and can’t afford,” Mr. Cassidy said. But some protections would remain in place. Parents would still be allowed to keep children on their insurance until the age of 26, and insurers could not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits. The   bill, called the Patient Freedom Act, would eliminate not only the unpopular individual mandate, but also the federal requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to   employees. Mr. Cassidy said that Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, both Republicans, were also sponsors of the bill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, were sponsors of a similar bill that Mr. Cassidy introduced in 2015. But the legislative landscape is different now. Republicans in Congress can repeal the Affordable Care Act, with support from Mr. Trump. In the Senate, they will need help from Democrats to adopt a replacement because Republicans are eight votes shy of the 60 needed to stop a filibuster."
"Katie Rich, a writer for “Saturday Night Live,” has been suspended from her position at that show following a widely criticized post she made Friday on her personal Twitter account in which she mocked Barron Trump, the    son of President Donald J. Trump. She was suspended immediately after her tweet, and her suspension is indefinite, according to someone familiar with the plans at “S. N. L. ,” who was not authorized by NBC to comment on personnel matters. That tweet on Friday, during Mr. Trump’s inauguration ceremony, drew widespread condemnation, and Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the post (which said “Barron will be this country’s first homeschool shooter”) and deactivated her Twitter account. Her name did not appear in the closing credits of “Saturday Night Live” in its broadcast on Saturday. On Monday afternoon, Ms. Rich reactivated her account and posted a message that said: “I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions  offensive words. It was inexcusable  I’m so sorry. ” The suspension of Ms. Rich, who was hired to join “S. N. L. ” at the end of 2013, comes at a delicate time for the program, when it has felt emboldened to lampoon Mr. Trump but has faced his swift retaliation on Twitter. Following the show’s broadcast of Jan. 14, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played Mr. Trump in a parody of his news conference from earlier that week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the following day: “NBC News is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!” Mr. Trump made no public comments about Saturday’s show, in which Mr. Baldwin did not appear. NBC said on Monday that Mr. Baldwin will host “Saturday Night Live” on Feb. 11 and appear throughout that program."
"Joanne Fitzgerald was getting divorced and was stressed out. When stomach pain kicked in, she saw a doctor to have it checked out. That was her mistake. The doctor diagnosed a mild form of gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining, and recommended some    medicine. But when the divorce became final, in 2008, she lost health coverage from her husband’s employer, and insurer after insurer refused to cover her because of the condition. She was finally offered a policy that excluded coverage for anything related to her gastrointestinal tract. “I thought I was being smart in going to the doctor and getting checked out,” Ms. Fitzgerald, 55, who currently lives in Washington, D. C. said recently. “Then I tried to go get insurance and everyone denied me. ” Her fortunes changed under the Affordable Care Act, the major health law signed by President Barack Obama that required insurers to cover   medical conditions. She was one of the millions of people who jumped at the opportunity and bought a policy available under the new law. Now, after President Trump and the   Congress have vowed to repeal and replace the health law, one of the most vexing questions is whether people like Ms. Fitzgerald will be covered. About 27 percent of people under 65 are thought to have some sort of   condition that will most likely leave them without individual insurance if the law is repealed, according to a recent study. The guarantee of coverage has already become a rallying cry for people who want to keep the law. The issue “is the third rail” for the Republicans, said Michael Turpin, a longtime health industry executive. Before the law, a fairly typical life event  —   like a divorce or the loss of a job  —   and a relatively minor medical condition could upend a person’s health coverage options. Stories of sick people unable to get coverage when they needed it most were legion. Mr. Trump insists he wants to keep the   requirement for insurers, and other top Republicans say people who want coverage should not be turned away. Details about how they will cover people with existing medical conditions have not yet emerged, but many lawmakers have started pushing an idea  —   known as   pools  —   that left many people uncovered or with strict limits to their coverage in the past. The challenge for lawmakers is this: How do you get insurers to cover people who will definitely need costly medical care  —   and do so without making insurance too expensive for everyone? The Affordable Care Act addresses that question by requiring everyone to get coverage or face a tax penalty. That mandate is meant to increase the number of healthy people who have insurance, distributing the costs of caring for those who are sick across a wider population. The thinking is that if enough healthy people sign up, the costs of sick people will be offset for insurers. Top Republicans, though, say the system is not working and point to   price increases for premiums. “There is a better way to fix that problem without giving everybody else all these massive premium increases,” the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, said at a recent televised forum. Finding a fix is far from simple. Before the law was passed, insurance companies evaluated the health of each person applying for coverage before offering a policy, and priced the plan to reflect the possible cost of care. The companies wanted to minimize the risk of losing money by paying for costly medical care for too many of their customers. Often, insurers offered no options to people with   conditions, because they considered the potential costs to be too high. As a result, 35 states had   pools, the program again on the lips of top lawmakers, including Mr. Ryan. The   programs offered a separate insurance pool for people with potentially expensive medical conditions. The idea is that by separating sick people from the majority of people who are healthy, insurers could offer cheaper rates to the healthy people. Insurers could charge higher prices to those with existing medical conditions, but they would also rely on other sources of funding, including from the government, to cover their costs. The system worked for Dan Nassimbene and his wife, who had breast cancer but is in remission. They enrolled in Colorado’s   pool for three years. She paid about $375 a month for a plan that covered most of her treatments. In 2014, though, the   pool was closed, and Mr. Nassimbene bought a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The cheapest plan he could buy for himself and his wife cost around $900 a month and came with a family deductible of around $12, 000, much higher than it was before. His income was too high for him to receive any government subsidies, which help about 80 percent of people buying such plans. “I had coverage but no access,” said Mr. Nassimbene, 55. He has since switched to a Christian health care sharing ministry, in which members cover one another’s medical bills. It does not qualify as coverage under the law. In many cases, the   pools were overburdened financially, leaving many people without insurance or with tight restrictions on coverage. Insurers refused to cover the individuals who were likely to have the highest expenses, like those who had H. I. V. or serious kidney disease, and the pools lost money. Many states had to turn applicants away  —   in some states, only a small percentage of those who applied received coverage  —   and the insurance was sharply limited to control spending. In Washington, over 80 percent of the people referred to the state’s   pool never got health insurance, said Mike Kreidler, the state’s insurance commissioner. In California, which relied on lawmakers to allocate money as part of the state budget, there was a waiting list, recalled Richard Figueroa, who was a senior administrator for the program. The pool operated on a     basis, Mr. Figueroa said, without regard to people’s income or the severity of their medical condition. “There were people literally dying on the waiting list,” he said. In addition, most of the states offering coverage had caps on payments for medical care. Washington’s annual maximum was $2 million, while California’s limit was $75, 000 a year. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans cannot have such a limit. In California, the program dwindled away until it served only 6, 300 at the end of 2011. Dennis Carr, for example, worked as an independent real estate agent when the financial markets crashed in 2008. He had savings, but he eventually had to drop his Blue Cross plan because his income had tailed off and he could not afford it. Mr. Carr, who is now 51, said his goal was to resume coverage as soon as he was financially secure. When he reapplied to the same insurer a few months later, he was rejected  —   and then rejected again by another insurer because of his asthma and a sinus condition. “It was just a real, real slap,” Mr. Carr said. He was directed to California’s   pool but found the premiums too high. He moved to Mexico as a way to afford his medications. He now lives in Phoenix, where he has coverage through an employer. “For all the thousands of people who   out because they couldn’t afford it, it broke our hearts on a daily basis,” Mr. Figueroa, the California official, said. For others, the coverage offered by the   pools was too limited for them to receive the care they needed. Beth Martinez, 40, who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to join Texas’   pool when she and her husband moved to Austin. Only six visits to the doctor were covered, and she found she could not afford the annual M. R. I. recommended to monitor her disease because of her high deductible. At one point, she said, she went four years without an M. R. I. She and her husband now live in California and are covered through private plans offered through that state’s marketplace, which meet all the health law’s requirements for   conditions. Because she can work only part time, she is eligible for federal subsidies, which bring the couple’s costs to $70 a month. Ms. Martinez had paid $275 a month in the Texas pool to cover herself, and her husband was uninsured. She now gets the M. R. I.s she needs under her plan, and her policy even pays for physical therapy, which allows her to put in longer hours at her job as a hairstylist and makeup artist. That sort of quality coverage, Ms. Martinez said, is a big departure from what she had through the   pool, adding that “it was definitely some of the worst insurance I had in my life. ”"
"Energy prices seem seldom out of the news. Politicians show their frustration with the energy market in proposing various solutions. This week Tory grandee and former prime minister John Major has called for a tax on energy companies. Last month at the Labour Party conference Ed Milliband proposed a 20 month price freeze. And last year, David Cameron had his own stab at “solving” the energy market, proposing that each company should be restricted to a single tariff in order to facilitate choosing between competing firms. It is easy to sympathise with these attempts to tackle an issue of considerable and understandable concern to voters. But they rely on limited understanding of the domestic energy market. Consumers are not switching their supplier much, partly because it is boring and (to some extent) difficult; they would prefer “the market” to solve the problem by assuring them they are not being ripped off with expensive tariffs.  But the market is not very competitive, and proposals to limit companies’ range of action are likely to have the incidental impact of rendering it even less so. It’s not the only market in which consumers get poor deals - the savings industry is another. But consumers spend a significant proportion of their budget on energy, and price hikes of up to 10% have become almost routine, blowing a hole in many consumers’ budgets. This is not a market where prices can be frozen for long without real consequences. Companies, predictably, say that costs have increased, or are due to increase. Actually, it’s remarkably difficult either to demonstrate or disprove this claim, so far as input costs are concerned, for two reasons. One is that the companies buy a portfolio of future contracts in order to ensure that the wholesale supplies they will have are enough to meet future demand. So the only way to keep a rough track on this is to assume a particular portfolio structure over time and plot the difference between this and retail prices, as Ofgem does. But there is a second feature. The wholesale market is by no means transparent because all six major electricity suppliers are also major generators, selling to themselves. So to keep track it’s necessary to examine profitability across both stages. This lack of transparency is what creates significant difficulties for potential new players on the supply side, in principle a rather competitive business. So it’s difficult to assess whether the companies are “too” profitable overall. What we can say, roughly, is where the money has gone, after the event. One thing the big six have been obliged to do by Ofgem for the past couple of years is publish accounts with some separation of costs. The most interesting of these (because the most potentially opaque) are the accounts for domestic electricity retailing; those for 2012 are the most recent available. They show that all the companies spent roughly half the revenue they got from domestic electricity consumers on their fuel costs. They then spend around 20% on distribution and transmission costs - these are regulated elements of cost. The bit that is least clear is their “supply costs” - the costs of running their retail operations - because these contain a variety of items including marketing costs and a profit margin. In total, though, these are perhaps 10% of the revenues. The companies also claim they need to invest in new generation facilities, so need some headroom in prices. There is some truth in this, because our old and dirty power stations are coming towards a forced end to their life. There is truth also in their claim that increasing amounts are being added to the bill by imposed environmental measures, themselves proposed by the government. These include the money they are forced to spend to try to make our homes better insulated, plus the money they in effect pay out to subsidise solar and wind generation. Emissions and environmental costs added 11% to the typical bill in 2012, and the bad news for consumers is that this element is set to rise over time. So one government aim, concerned as we must be with the potential impact of global warming and the influence of fossil fuels, is pushing policies that raise energy prices to consumers. But voters have a short-term interest in seeing low prices, and an increasing proportion find themselves in fuel poverty. It really is an intractable issue, made worse by the increasingly wide gap between rich and poor in this country. It is not going to improve.  Governments have dithered about how to meet the inevitable supply gap created by decommissioning old coal and nuclear power stations, and in this sense the recent agreement over the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station is welcome news. But the power it will supply is going to be very expensive; around double current wholesale prices.  With this deal, plus governmental subsidies for wind and solar power, we are moving away from a market for wholesale power towards a managed system. It is also an inherently less reliable system - wind and solar power is not flexible - so needs backup from gas power stations and other more rapid response facilities, which requires investment. So long-term power needs will be assured only at high prices. Moves to open up the wholesale market, although not headline grabbing, are the best way to inject more competition into the retail market. But because the retail profit margins are modest, there is limited headroom for lower prices from this source; a 5% fall would be at the optimistic end of the spectrum, and of course the other pressures discussed above are all in the other direction, and are larger.  So increased competition at the retail level is unlikely to increase downward pressure on wholesale prices much. In sum, my view is that the energy market is an area which exposes the increased income inequality that Britain has experienced for some years now. There are very many people in the UK who find it difficult or impossible even now to afford their energy bills and unfortunately I think this will only increase, given the price pressures.  Therefore, in my opinion, an even more difficult political decision needs to be made - deliberately reduce inequality and even out the income distribution by raising income tax and increasing transfers to the poor, in order to make the higher energy costs more affordable for all. Subsidies for energy would be a short-term fix, not a long-term solution."

The latest image from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows our sun as a blank canvas. No sunspots. Solar cycle 24 activity continues to be lowest in nearly 200 years

According to NASA’s Spaceweather.com:
Sunspot number: 0 
Updated 30 Jun 2016
Spotless Days
Current Stretch: 7 days
2016 total: 11 days (6%)
2015 total: 0 days (0%) 
2014 total: 1 day (<1%)
2013 total: 0 days (0%)
2012 total: 0 days (0%)
2011 total: 2 days (<1%)
2010 total: 51 days (14%)
2009 total: 260 days (71%)
 
The last time sunspots vanished for a whole week was in Dec. 2010–a time when the sun was bouncing back from a long Solar Minimum. In this case, the 7 week interregnum is a sign that a new Solar Minimum is coming.
The sunspot cycle is like a pendulum, swinging back and forth every 11-years or so between times of high and low sunspot number.  The next low is expected in 2019-2020. Between now and then sunspots will become increasingly rare with stretches of days, then weeks, then months of “billiard-ball suns.”
The F10.7 flux has been in a disciplined downtrend for nigh on 18 months now. It is now only nine units above the immutable floor of activity of 64:

Figure 1: F10.7 flux 2014 – 2016
We have F10.7 data from 1948. Plotting up the whole solar cycles since then, Solar Cycle 24 has been following Solar Cycle 22:

Figure 2: F10.7 flux of Solar Cycle 24 and Solar Cycle 22
In Figure 2 above, Solar Cycle 24 (red line) has been following the activity of Solar Cycle 22 (black line) for the last two years. If it keeps following Solar Cycle 22’s activity, that will make it a weak, short cycle. Strong cycles such as Solar Cycle 22 are generally shorter than average and weak cycles are generally longer. The other solar cycles are shown as dotted lines.
The solar polar field strength divergence continues to build and is unprecedented in the record:

Figure 3: Solar Polar Magnetic Field Strength by Hemisphere
Finally, Figure 4 following shows that the peak of the F10.7 flux in Solar Cycle 24 was in February 2014. The Oulu neutron count duly turned up a year later (inverted in Figure 4) in March 2015.

Figure 4: F10.7 Flux and Inverted Oulu Neutron Count 1964 – 2016
What is interesting from Figure 4 is that there has been a consistent increase in the neutron count relative to F10.7 flux over Solar Cycle 24 relative to the relationship in the previous four cycles.

Representative Ernest Istook (R‐​Okla.) has discovered a mortal threat to the republic. The threat is a display ad placed by a pro‐​drug legalization group, Change the Climate, Inc., on Washington D.C.‘s bus and subway system. The ad showed a young couple, with the caption: “Enjoy Better Sex! Legalize and Tax Marijuana.”



And to deal with this outrage, Istook has introduced a measure to financially penalize Washington’s Metro transit authority for running the ad. Moreover, Istook’s bill would prohibit any transit system that receives federal funds from running advertising from a group that advocates decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana.



This is hardly the first time that the blackjack of withholding federal funds has been used to coerce recipients into embracing pet policies of politicians, but it has to be one of the more odious. Istook’s bill shows utter contempt for the First Amendment, and indeed for the entire concept of political debate.



But drug warriors have repeatedly showed their intolerance of opposing views — and their eagerness to use the power of government to suppress critics. For example, in the mid‐​1990s, the late Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY) attempted to have the tax‐​exempt status of the Cato Institute revoked because it had the temerity to sponsor discussions of the legalization option. 



The most ominous proposal for repressing pro‐​drug reform speech comes (not surprisingly) from the United Nations. The UN’s International Narcotics Control Board has issued a report implicitly calling on member states to criminalize opposition to the war on drugs. Citing the 1988 UN Convention Against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, the INCB asserts that all governments are obligated to enact laws that prohibit “inciting” or “inducing” people to use illegal drugs and to punish such violations as criminal offenses.



If such a vague and chilling restriction on freedom of expression were not odious enough, the UN board contends that any portrayal that shows illicit drug use “in a favourable light” constitutes incitement and therefore should be banned as well. Since the report also repeatedly denounces medical marijuana initiatives as well as decriminalization or legalization proposals, even the most sedate advocacy of changing prohibitionist drug laws might run afoul of the censorship regime being pushed by the United Nations.



It is not reassuring that the U.S. government has pledged to cooperate with the UN group’s global anti‐​drug efforts. Although Washington has not explicitly endorsed the censorship recommendations, neither has it stated that the United States rejects such proposals — even though it certainly could have added that caveat. Indeed, one official pledged “absolute cooperation” with the UN’s drug control programs.



Those who might be tempted to dismiss the significance of efforts to gag proponents of drug legalization should know that government officials have already sought to implement censorship measures (albeit more limited ones than the comprehensive bans suggested by some drug warriors). For example, authorities in Maryland prosecuted an individual for publicly divulging the identity of two undercover narcotics officers. Attempting to prohibit such disclosures by charging the defendant with “obstructing and hindering a police officer,” Maryland officials endeavored to give undercover narcotics officers the same protection that Congress afforded to the CIA and other intelligence agents to wage the Cold War and the subsequent war on terror. 



Although the Maryland Court of special appeals eventually overturned the conviction on the grounds that it violated the defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to freedom of speech, several aspects of the case remain troubling. First, the fact that Maryland authorities sought to impose such censorship in the first place; second, that the defendant was convicted in a trial court; and third, that the Court of Appeals overturning the conviction on a divided vote. It is hardly reassuring that a minority of the justices were willing to allow such a violation of the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech to pass muster.



Such examples suggest that some advocates of drug prohibition regard the “war” on drugs as more than a metaphor. Pervasive intolerance is also all too typical of a wartime mindset in which opponents are seen, not merely as people who hold a different point of view, but as traitors to a noble cause.



Regardless of one’s position on drug legalization, Americans who believe in freedom of expression and in the importance of political debate ought to condemn Istook’s measure and all other attempts to stifle the pro‐​legalization case. Otherwise, the First Amendment might become the most prominent example of “collateral damage” in the war on drugs.

"BOISSEUIL, France  —   A furious   Ducourtioux shouted with his fellow union members as they banged on the plexiglass window of a meeting hall in   France. Inside was Manuel Valls, the former Socialist prime minister, who was campaigning for president in this bastion of the French left. A member of France’s oldest trade union, Mr. Ducourtioux, 52, was a stalwart Socialist Party voter who once might have been inside, cheering. But no longer. His hands callused by three decades as a metalworker, Mr. Ducourtioux is angry that the Socialist government has failed to stop French automakers from moving factories outside the country, as manufacturing declines in this decaying region. He said he was at risk of losing his job at an automotive subcontractor. “Mr. Valls knew the situation here,” Mr. Ducourtioux said. “He did nothing. ” France’s presidential election this year is being closely watched as a barometer of European public disaffection, and no party is more visibly out of favor than the governing Socialists. President François Hollande, a Socialist, is so deeply unpopular that he is not running for  . Mr. Valls came in second out of seven candidates in a primary of   parties on Sunday. With about 31 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Valls trailed the top   Benoît Hamon, a former education minister in Mr. Hollande’s government, who took about 36 percent of the votes. More worrisome for the left was that turnout was roughly 50 percent lower than it was in 2011, when the the   parties last held a primary. Few analysts believe that any of the Socialists have a real shot at retaining the presidency in the April general election. The collapse of the establishment left in France is hardly a unique phenomenon. Across Europe,   populist parties are gaining strength, including in France, while the mainstream left, which played a central role in building modern Europe, is in crisis. From Italy to Poland to Britain and beyond, voters are deserting   parties, as leftist politicians struggle to remain relevant in a moment when politics is inflamed by     Union anger. “Wherever you look in Europe the Socialists are not doing well, with the exception of Portugal,” said Philippe Marlière, a professor of French and European politics at University College London. He added that the left lacked “a narrative that tries to unite the different sectors of the working class. ” Each country has its distinctive dynamics, but one common theme is the difficulty many mainstream left parties are having in responding to the economic and social dislocation caused by globalization. In Italy, constituencies that used to routinely back the   Democratic Party are turning to the new   Five Star Movement, which is Euroskeptic and    —   just as some     voters in France are now looking at the   National Front. “We have a population cut in half by globalization,” said Thomas Guénolé, a political science professor at Sciences Po in Paris and the author of “Unhappy Globalization,” who sees the winners and losers of globalization as the axis of European politics. A breakdown of voting patterns in the December referendum in Italy, which resulted in the fall of the   government, revealed that urban centers, the southern half of the country and young, unemployed workers overwhelmingly rejected the reform measures put forward by Matteo Renzi, then the prime minister. “Those very voters who were traditionally represented by the left in this case, veered to the Five Star Movement,” said Marco Damilano, a political commentator for the newsmagazine L’Espresso. He added that the new party had built on popular anger even though it did not offer answers for the malaise. The coalition of Poland’s two biggest   parties, the Democratic Left Alliance and Your Movement, suffered a humiliating defeat in 2015. Not only did the conservatives win an absolute majority in Parliament for the first time since the collapse of communism, but the left garnered so little support that not a single   politician represents those interests in Parliament. In Britain, the Labour Party is in tatters with a leader who appeals to activists but has failed to build a   coalition. Across Europe, the old Socialist blocs have fractured into smaller parties, partly because their voting bases have changed but also because rampant inequality and the decline of the middle class have created fertile ground for more extreme parties. “On the left they are trying to stand up for their old core group, industrial workers,” said Steve Coulter, who teaches political economy at the London School of Economics. “But then there’s another group on the left, who are   trade, L. G. B. T.   drinking, bearded hipsters  —   and that’s the   part of their support. ” The result in France is that the National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, “has moved into the old traditionalist, protectionist precincts of the authoritarian left,” Mr. Coulter said. In Limousin, a relatively poor area of central France best known for the succulent beef from its cattle industry, its yellow apples and its elegant Limoges porcelain, these broader economic forces are evident. Mr. Ducourtioux said that he had voted for Mr. Hollande in the last election, but that this time he was looking toward the National Front, although he stopped short of naming it. “You have Trump  —   who do you think I am going to vote for?” Mr. Ducourtioux said. For years, the regional economy was built on agriculture, manufacturing and small businesses that were subcontractors to larger enterprises like the automakers Renault and Peugeot. And for most of the last 100 years it was a   stronghold. The Socialist mayor of Limoges, Alain Rodet, served multiple terms until he was toppled in 2014 by a   psychiatrist,   Lombertie. He had no government experience and ran as an outsider (although on the eve of the election he became a member of the mainstream conservative party, now known as the Republicans). In those same local elections, National Front candidates won an unprecedented 17 percent of the votes in the first round, a high figure given the leftist traditions of the area, which was the birthplace in 1895 of France’s leading trade union. In a small storefront office, Vincent Gérard, a representative of the National Front in the region, said the party’s growth was telling because the left was so entrenched there. His own story is typical of many people in the region. His small electrical supply business once had five employees but now has two, including himself. “Eighty percent of my clients were industrial, and in five years I lost all of them,” he said. “The markets are no longer local,” he said. “They have gone to Romania, or the Czech Republic, I don’t know exactly. They’re in Europe, but in Eastern Europe. ” Compounding the sense of a changing world, even a modest wave of immigration disturbed many local residents. Beginning about six years ago, a small number of   Africans arrived in Limoges, soon followed by bigger numbers of Eastern Europeans. “So, here in our street, we had principally Bulgarians, afterwards Romanians and then Albanians,” Mr. Gérard said. “Why? This I know, because Europe no longer has any borders. ” At the same time, many affluent people began moving to the suburbs for bigger houses and left the city center to older people and newcomers, many of whom were migrants. Mr. Rodet, the mayor who was toppled, said that just weeks before the election, there had been a rumor that an abandoned military base near the center of Limoges would become a home for “3, 000 Kosovars. ” “It was not true, but I did not respond quickly enough,” he said, and by then the idea had gained currency. Not all traditional centrist voters are concerned about immigration or dwindling manufacturing jobs. Alexis Mons, a   entrepreneur, has a digital marketing firm, Emakina, which does branding worldwide for companies, many of them high end. His worry is the politicians and citizens who want to turn back the clock and stop the pace of change, so he is looking closely at the policies of Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister under Mr. Hollande. Mr. Macron is running for president as an independent, favors international trade and is rising in the polls. “You have an old industrial base that is very much intertwined with the political milieu in some fashion,” Mr. Mons said. “All this little world talks to each other, it has its customs, it does business and then a new economy is born, a new economy with   with people coming from the internet, and that no one foresaw. ” There are now more than 100   firms just in Limoges, Mr. Mons said, yet few people in the area know about the business park where the companies are. “I have the impression that a good part of the establishment lives wearing the spectacles of the 20th century,” he said. He added that politicians were manipulating the picture so that “in the   neighborhoods, there has been a sense of abandonment that pushes people into the arms of the National Front. ” “The world has changed,” he said, “and a certain number of people do not want to see that. ”"
"Ashwellthorpe Lower Wood in Norfolk, England has been managed by coppicing, an ancient form of forestry, for more than a thousand years. It was recorded as coppiced woodland in the Domesday Book published in 1068 and, as implied from its name, ash trees are a major constitutent species. In fact the name Ashwellthorpe comes from the Vikings, for whom Yggdrasil, the giant ash tree, was sacred. In 1992 the wood was purchased by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust as a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest. Since then the coppice rotation has been managed by local volunteers to maintain the amazing biodiversity there. So we were devastated when, in September 2012, we realised that many ash trees in the wood were diseased with what we suspected was ash dieback fungus that had spread from mainland Europe. We tested extracted DNA from the pith of diseased branches, and confirmed the fungal pathogen was present. Ash dieback had already arrived in the UK in imported trees, but no trees have been planted in Ashwellthorpe, an ancient wood that could have existed since the last Ice Age. This must have been a substantial natural infection, implying that ash trees in Britain will become infected, and that the inexorable spread of the disease from the east to the west of Europe would not been halted by the English Channel. The only questions now are how long the disease will take to establish itself across the country and what proportion of trees will be tolerant to the disease and will survive. Faced with this scenario, what can be done? European scientists had already established a great deal. The cause of ash dieback was identified in 2006, the fungus named Chalara fraxinea, later realised to actually be a stage of the fungus Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus. DNA techniques were established that could confirm the presence of the fungus, and researchers had identified several aspects of its lifecycle, including how the disease is spread by spores fired into the air from small fruiting bodies (mushrooms) that sprout in July and August from rotting leaf stems.  We need to gain more understanding of how the fungal pathogen works. For example, how can we establish laboratory-based tests to discover how it causes the disease? These could be used rapidly to identify resistant trees; they could also be used to establish if and how trees could  be inoculated against the disease. For instance species of Trichoderma - ubiquitous, largely harmless fungi found in the soil - have been cultured as biological control agents against some plant fungal diseases. Establishing and laying out the pathogen’s genome sequence and identifying the genes used for infection can give us real insight into how the disease functions. Those working with us have sequenced H. pseudoalbidus using a variety found in Britain. By comparing it with the genes of European varieties, it’s clear that the variation between samples cannot be due to crossbreeding with H. albidus, the closely related, but harmless, fungus usually found on ash leaves. The key to the long term survival of ash trees lies in the observations of Erik Dahl Kjaer and colleagues in Denmark. Using trees grafted several years ago, they found that one tree, Tree 35 out of 39 trees tested, showed tolerance to the fungus in a number of different environments. This showed that this lower susceptibility to infection is not due to environmental influences, so it must be genetically determined. This means we can breed ash that can withstand the disease. We can be optimistic of some level of genetic resistance among UK ash trees too, and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is undertaking a long-term breeding programme as part of its Chalara Management Plan. Can we help nature by identifying regions of the ash genome associated with tolerance to the disease? This could be done using genetic crosses with resistant trees, but this would take years. An alternative approach is to try to undertake association genetics. A recently described modification of association genetics is to identify genetic markers using RNA sequencing, a method recently pioneered in crop plants. But genetic approaches require a detailed genetic map, and there is no map for ash or any close relatives yet. Sequencing the ash genome would help greatly in generating a map. Such a genetic project can provide the tools to help identify the most promising crosses to make between tolerant ash trees. But at this stage nothing is known about whether tolerance is due to one or many genes, whether there are different types of tolerance, whether tolerance is recessive or dominant, or whether combinations of different genes can enhance tolerance. It will take many years to establish, but for those countries facing decimation of their ash forests, it is certainly worth trying."

How many times have we heard from Al Gore and assorted European politicians that “the science is settled” on global warming? In other words, it’s “time for action.” Climate change is, as recently stated by Hans Blix, former U.N. Chief for weapons detection in Iraq, the most important issue of our time, far more dangerous than people flying fuel‐​laden aircraft into skyscrapers or possibly detonating backpack nukes in Baltimore Harbor. 



Well, the science may now be settled, but not in the way Mr. Gore and Mr. Blix would have us believe. Three bombshell papers have just hit the refereed literature that knock the stuffing of Mr. Blix’s position and that of his company, the United Nations, and its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 



The IPCC states repeatedly: 







Therefore, they say, we need to limit carbon dioxide emissions (i.e., energy use) right now, despite the expense and even though the cost will fall almost entirely on the United States, gravely harming the world’s economic engine while exerting no detectable change on climate in the foreseeable future. 



The IPCC claims to have carefully corrected the temperature records for the well‐​known problem of local (“urban,” as opposed to global) warming. But this has always troubled serious scientists, because the way the U.N. checks for artificial warming makes it virtually impossible to detect in recent decades — the same period in which our cities have undergone the greatest growth and sprawl.



The surface temperature record shows a warming rate of about 0.17 degrees Celsius (0.31 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. However, there are two other records — one from satellites, the other from weather balloons — that tell a different story. Neither annual satellite nor balloon trends differ significantly from zero since the satellite record started in 1979. These records reflect temperatures in what is called the lower atmosphere, or roughly between 5,000 and 30,000 feet.



Four years ago, a distinguished panel of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences concluded there is a real disparity between the reported surface warming and the temperature trends measured in the atmosphere above. Since then, many investigators have tried to explain the cause of the disparity while others have denied its existence.



So, which record is right, the U.N. surface record showing the larger warming or the other two? There’s another record, from 7 feet above the ground, derived from balloon data recently been released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In two research papers in the July 9 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, two of us (Mr. Douglass and Mr. Singer) compared it for correspondence with the surface record and the lower atmosphere histories. The odd‐​record‐​out turns out to be the U.N.‘s hot‐​surface history.



This is a double kill, both on the U.N.‘s temperature records and its vaunted climate models. That’s because the models generally predict an increased warming rate with height (outside of local polar regions). Neither the satellite nor the balloon records can find it. When this was noted in the first satellite paper published in 1990, some scientists objected that the record, which began in 1979, was too short. Now we have a quarter‐​century of concurrent balloon and satellite data, both screaming that the U.N.‘s climate models have failed, as well as indicating its surface record is simply too hot.



If the models are wrong as one goes up in the atmosphere, then any correspondence between them and surface temperatures is either pretty lucky or the product of some unspecified “adjustment.” Getting the vertical distribution of temperature wrong means everything dependent upon that — precipitation and cloudiness, as examples — must be wrong. Obviously, the amount of cloud in the air determines the day’s high temperature as well as whether it rains.



As bad as things have gone for the IPCC and its ideologues, it gets worse — much, much worse. 



After four years of one of the most rigorous peer reviews ever, Canadian Ross McKitrick and another of us (Mr. Michaels) published a paper searching for “economic” signals in the temperature record. Mr. McKitrick, an economist, was initially piqued by what several climatologists had noted as a curiosity in both the U.N. and satellite records: Statistically speaking, the greater a nation’s gross domestic product, the more it warms. The research showed that somewhere about half of the warming in the U.N. surface record was explained by economic factors, which can be changes in land use, quality of instrumentation, or upkeep of records. This worldwide study added fuel to a fire started a year earlier by the University of Maryland’s Eugenia Kalnay, who calculated a similar 50 percent bias due to economic factors in the U.S. records.



So, to all who worry about global warming, to all who think people threatening to blow up millions to get their political way is no big deal by comparison, chill out. The science is settled. The “skeptics,” the strange name applied to those whose work shows the planet isn’t coming to an end, have won.

O’Sullivan’s Law states that “any organization or enterprise that is not expressly right-wing will become left-wing over time”.



This is in part because leftists tend to only tolerate other leftists. Multiple surveys have shown that conservatives are twice as likely as ‘liberals’ to tolerate different opinions. So once leftists establish a foothold in an institution, they will only hire other leftists, and bully out non-leftists.



The public service is particularly subject to O’Sullivan’s Law due to the parasitic nature of leftism.



The “any organization or enterprise that is not expressly right-wing will become left-wing” over time result is the **Deep Green State.**



There is a pattern of conservative governments setting up agencies to deliver policy outcomes but either locking in an inflexible process that cannot be subsequently modified or failing to establish the appropriate machinery from the outset. An example of the latter is the $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund, whereby Energy Minister Taylor sought to divert soft loan subsidy funding of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation [itself established by the Abbott Government] to reliable new (and hence lower emissions) coal generation. But, of the 12 projects recommended for further consideration by the panel he set up, only one was a coal project. And that will eventually be killed.



I recently wrote that[ green activists are using lawfare](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/03/the-high-cost-of-green-lawfare/) to wreck billions of dollars in development. One of the reasons they are so successful is that they have so many sympathetic fellow travelers in public institutions which have been thoroughly white-anted by the Long March left.



The fact is that the bureaucracy appoints its own gatekeepers while ministers pretend to be in charge with portentous speeches. The committee set up to guard public spending through the Emissions Reduction Fund is headed by an environmental activist, ANU’s Professor **Andrew Mackintosh** (who was recently congratulated by the Environment Department for also being appointed as a reviewer of the Commonwealth’s expansionist Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act). Its other members also comprise environmental activists from within academia and the bureaucracy and are supported by the architects of the infamous National Energy Guarantee, the Climate Change Policy Branch in the Department of the Environment and Energy.



[…]The tentacles of the Deep Green State, however, run deep. Even though the head of the panel is **Grant King** (previously Origin Energy and AGL), its other members are **Susie Smith** , CEO of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, the aforementioned **Prof Andrew Macintosh** , head of the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, and David Parker, the Clean Energy Regulator.



And so it goes.



Should any conservative government be so heretical as to try and challenge the left-wing hegemony, they can be sure of being viciously attacked by an overwhelmingly left-wing media.



The Deep State even has its own reliable reporters at The Guardian, the ABC, Channel Nine’s left-wing tabloids The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age and News Corp to whom they can selectively leak, demonstrating that they are carrying the flag of deindustrialisation and that no political master can touch them.



As a nation we are throwing out of work a million people from activities that provide consumers with the products and services they want. But the jobs remain of those – inside and outside government – dedicated to undermining the economy’s efficiency.



The Deep Green State is the nomenklatura of cultural Marxism. And they guard their privilege with dedicated zeal.

"In an emotional article making waves on social media at the moment, yachtsman Ivan Macfadyen reports seeing no marine life at sea, only floating rubbish, while sailing across the Pacific. He concludes that “the ocean is broken”. I understand Ivan’s feelings, as I too have sailed tens of thousands of miles onboard research vessels and on my sailboat, enjoying the slow and silent pace of life propelled by wind and waves. The two issues Macfadyen raises - overfishing and plastic pollution - are real problems. More than three-quarters of the oceans’ fish stocks have been depleted, sometimes beyond recovery. The global tuna industry, particularly, is better portrayed as the War On Tuna than a fishery. And the world’s oceans are filled with large amounts of plastic debris, which are eaten or caught up in marine life or seabirds, or which break down into microscopic particles that are ingested and affect wildlife in ways we don’t yet know. So yes, there are plenty of problems in the ocean. But it is not yet broken. I am increasingly upset about reports that say it is; we scientists are to some extent to blame, as we love being the bearer of bad news, composing an overly apocalyptic narrative.  Depicting the ocean as broken and suffering from a litany of plagues including climate change, hypoxia, eutrophication, ocean acidification, marine pests, spreading jellyfish blooms, and loss of valuable habitat, suggests a problem beyond repair. This eventually deters society from engaging. These plagues are certainly real, but their severity is sometimes exaggerated through a feedback loop involving, among others, the spinning of research headlines to compete for media attention. Let’s focus on Macfadyen’s evidence for a broken ocean: two snapshots of the Pacific, ten years apart, suggesting a depletion of marine life and huge plastic pollution. The ocean is a dynamic ecosystem, which fluctuates broadly over time, from its physical and chemical properties to the abundance and distribution of fauna and flora. Such fluctuations can deceive the casual observer - to detect real change requires high quality data gleaned from systematic long term observations. For instance, my co-workers and I analysed global changes in jellyfish populations, and found there is no basis to the claim that they are growing “plague”. Instead, we found that jellyfish populations fluctuated over 20 year cycles, giving the misleading perception that the most recent rising phase of this cycle (roughly between late 1990s and late 2000s) was an unprecedented event. Likewise, we also know that many changes portrayed as symptoms of a broken ocean, such as coral bleaching, outbreaks of invaders such as the crown of thorns starfish or toxic algae, may also largely represent symptoms of global oscillations that we do not yet fully understand and in which humans’ actions play little or no role. Separating the human impacts entwined in such natural fluctuations is a daunting task, so we should not be too quick to jump to conclusions and blame humans for all the changes we see around us. Our analysis showed that such fluctuations happened in the past, but very few scientists were watching and they lacked the channels, such as the internet, to share their results.  Soon after the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 that triggered the Fukushima accident, NOAA published models that predicted how the huge amount of debris washed into the ocean by the power of the retreating waves would take three years to travel across the ocean and wash up sometime in 2014 on the beaches of California, Oregon and Washington in the US. Had Macfadyen checked NOAA’s web page, he’d have expected the garbage patch he encountered. The tsunami was not caused by humans, so we should rein in our feelings of guilt about it. It does, however, provide a brutal exposure to the reality that we feverishly consume and dispose of too many, mostly plastic objects, many manufactured with harmful chemicals, that we use just for just a short while and then throw away. What kind of fishing line did Macfadyen use in his first voyage, and what happened to it when he’d finished? What chemicals are in the anti-fouling paint for his boat’s hull? Likewise, how and where was the fish we consumed with our last meal captured? Did it come from a sustainable fishery or a sustainable aquaculture farm? Did we bother to ask if it was a certified product? Do we demand that this information be displayed to guide our choices as consumers? Should we eat tuna, an apex predator at the top of the food chain, or should we settle for sardines, oysters and seaweed? Was that chicken we ate yesterday for dinner fed fishmeal? Do we drive a four-wheel drive car whose CO2 emissions will further acidify the oceans, or do we cycle, drive a hybrid or electric vehicle or catch a bus powered by biofuels? Do rich, developed nations with among the world’s largest greenhouse gas footprints refuse to implement carbon taxes or emissions reduction strategies because we “cannot afford” them? These questions are not easy ones to ask ourselves, but we confront our contradictions. We enjoy eating seafood, an essential component of a healthy diet. We know that fish stocks are over exploited, so developing aquaculture is the only avenue to sustainably meet the growing demands for seafood. But then we get upset if we can see an aquaculture farm off our coasts. Responsible consumers will not break the ocean; those who choose to ignore the consequences of their day-to-day decisions as consumers will. The place where the struggle to save the oceans from breaking is fought everyday - not once every ten years - is at our local shops."
"The idea behind biodiversity offsets is to develop a new way of preserving nature that more accurately accounts for the value to us of the natural world. The abundance and diversity of plants and animals, and their role in ecosystems – known as biodiversity – can be damaged or destroyed by building and development. But this is what economic growth generally involves: roads, houses, offices and industrial plants have to go somewhere, and sometimes the environment is damaged or destroyed as a consequence.  Ideally, it would be possible to generate economic growth in a way that avoids biodiversity loss and preserves nature. One way this could be achieved is biodiversity offsets. This mechanism would require developers to provide compensation for the damages which result from their actions. For example, destroying a wood to make way for new houses would mean the developer would have to provide another wood somewhere else to replace it, or pay a third party to do so. These offsets, proponents argue, should result in “no net loss” of biodiversity from development. The concept of biodiversity offsets is being discussed by the UK Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee. If proposals are taken forward, biodiversity offsets could become one of the most important changes to how decisions affecting the environment are made in Britain. Supporters claim this would create a better way of making decisions. Modern societies appear to have a broken economic compass: we don’t value nature enough compared to development and economic growth. Biodiversity offsets would put a price on nature, and force developers to pay for the damage they inflict. This would make development more expensive and conservation more appealing. There are other ways of choosing between development or conservation. In Britain this is governed by the need for planning permission, which is granted or denied, or granted with conditions, by local authorities. One of the aspects they must consider is impact on biodiversity, and through conditions known as Section 107 agreements they have the power require compensation in cases where a project would have a negative impact on nature. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commissioned the Ecosystem Markets Task Force (EMTF), to examine this and other market mechanisms that affected the environment. The EMTF identified biodiversity offsets as the most promising in terms of promoting economic growth, with the potential to simplify the planning process, and reduce the time it takes to obtain planning permission. These comments were echoed by the secretary of state, Owen Patterson, who said it would allow the economy to grow, while protecting nature. But it is not clear how the biodiversity offset mechanism would be integrated into the existing planning system. Despite these claimed advantages, environmental activists and NGOs have raised concerns about the feasibility and potential consequences of biodiversity offsets. Biodiversity is complex and biologists have generally been critical of claims that biodiversity can be easily measured and quantified in a single location, let alone then usefully compared to biodiversity elsewhere. It is not possible to assure that biodiversity in two locations is the same, or qualitatively equivalent. And without this, the principle of ensuring no net loss of biodiversity collapses. The displacement of damages also raises problems, as it allows the possibility of damages in an area with high land prices, such as London and the South East, to be offset in an area where land prices are much lower, such as the North East of England. This would lead to an unfair and uneven distribution of damages and biodiversity, and again would not ensure no net loss of biodiversity in any meaningful way. A final question raised is about power. Critics of offsetting suspect that it would render the planning process toothless, allowing rich and powerful companies to simply buy their way out of the proper planning process. Biodiversity offsetting, could easily become a licence to trash. The idea underpinning offsets is appealing, and could at least be used to spark debate about the value - the literal, economic worth - of nature and the need to conserve it. But the rules and regulations parliament is considering must ensure that the maximum distance between damage and offset is limited and that the limits to measuring biodiversity are compensated for. And, most importantly, biodiversity offsetting must work as a part of the existing planning regulations, not supersede it. Biodiversity offsetting has the potential to change the way we think of nature in Britain. It should be discussed and analysed by the public before becoming compulsory. But it should not be allowed to become the main way by which we, as a society, govern nature."

Cooling In Coming Decades

A new scientific paper authored by seven scientists affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences was just published in the scientific journal Bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences: Physics.
The scientists dismiss both “greenhouse gases” and variations in the Sun’s irradiance as significant climate drivers, and instead embrace cloud cover variations — modulated by cosmic ray flux — as a dominant contributor to climate change.
A concise summary: As cosmic ray flux increases, more clouds are formed on a global scale.  More global-scale cloud cover means more solar radiation is correspondingly blocked from reaching the Earth’s surface (oceans).   With an increase in global cloud cover projected for the coming decades (using trend analysis), a global cooling is predicted.

Stozhkov et al., 2017
Cosmic Rays, Solar Activity, and Changes in the Earth’s Climate
Stozhkov, Y.I., Bazilevskaya, G.A., Makhmutov, V.S., Svirzhevsky, N.S., Svirzhevskaya, A.K., Logachev, V.I., Okhlopkov, V.P.
“One of the most important problems facing humanity is finding the physical mechanism responsible for global climate change, particularly global warming on the Earth. … Summation of these periodicities for the future (after 2015) allows us to forecast the next few decades. The solid heavy line in Fig. 1 shows that cooling (a drop in ΔT values) is expected in the next few decades.”



“Figure 2 shows the dependence between the annual average changes ΔT in the global temperature in the near-surface air layer and charged particle flux N in the interval of altitudes from 0.3 to 2.2 km. We can see there is a connection between values ΔТ [temperature] and N [charged particle flux]: with an increase in cosmic ray flux N, the values of changes of global temperature decrease. This link is expressed by the relation ΔT = –0.0838N + 4.307 (see the dashed line in Fig. 2), where the ΔT values are given in °C, and the N values (in particle/min units) are related to the charged particle flux measured at an altitude of 1.3 km. The correlation coefficient of the line with the experimental data is r = –0.62 ± 0.08.”

“Our results could be connected with the mechanism of charged particle fluxes influencing the Earth’s climate; it includes, first of all, the effect charged particles have on the accelerated formation of centers of water vapor condensation, and thus on the increase in global cloud cover. The total cloud cover is directly connected with the global temperature of the near surface air layer.”

Another newly published scientific paper also projects cooling in the coming decades.  Dr. Norman Page, geologist, attributes climate changes to natural (60-year and millennial-scale) cycles of solar activity (and cloud cover changes), and he notes that the rise in solar activity since the depths of the Little Ice Age has been the predominant climate driver.  The millennial peak in solar activity occurred in about 1991, with the corresponding (lagged) temperature peak in 2004.  Within the next few years the temperature is projected to drop significantly.  Annotated graphs depicting the robust correlation between cloud cover changes and global temperature, as well as the forecasted global cooling, are included below.

The coming cooling: Usefully accurate climate forecasting for policy makers
“This paper argues that the methods used by the establishment climate science community are not fit for purpose and that a new forecasting paradigm should be adopted. Earth’s climate is the result of resonances and beats between various quasi-cyclic processes of varying wavelengths. It is not possible to forecast the future, unless we have a good understanding of where the earth is in time in relation to the current phases of those different interacting natural quasi periodicities. Evidence is presented specifying the timing and amplitude of the natural 60 ± year and, more importantly, 1000 year periodicities (observed emergent behaviors) that are so obvious in the temperature record. Data related to the solar climate driver are discussed and the solar cycle 22 low in the neutron count (high solar activity) in 1991 is identified as a solar activity millennial peak and correlated with the millennial peak – inversion point – in the RSS temperature trend in about 2004. The cyclic trends are projected forward and predict a probable general temperature decline in the coming decades and centuries. Estimates of the timing and amplitude of the coming cooling are made. If the real climate outcomes follow a trend which approaches the near term forecasts of this working hypothesis, the divergence between the IPCC forecasts and those projected by this paper will be so large by 2021 as to make the current, supposedly actionable, level of confidence in the IPCC forecasts untenable.”



“The global millennial temperature rising trend seen in Figure 11 from 1984 to the peak and trend inversion point in the Hadcrut3 data at 2003/4 is the inverse correlative of the Tropical Cloud Cover fall from 1984 to the Millennial trend change at 2002. The lags in these trends from the solar activity peak at 1991 (Figure 10) are 12 and 11 years, respectively. These correlations suggest possible teleconnections between the GCR flux, clouds, and global temperatures.”



“Unless the range and causes of natural variation, as seen in the natural temperature quasi-periodicities, are known within reasonably narrow limits, it is simply not possible to even begin to estimate the effect of anthropogenic CO2 on climate. Given the lack of any empirical CO2-climate connection reviewed earlier and the inverse relationship between CO2 and temperature [during the Holocene, when CO2 rose as temperatures declined] seen in Figure 2, and for the years 2003.6–2015.2 in Figure 4, during which CO2 rose 20 ppm, the simplest and most rational working hypothesis is that the solar ‘activity’ increase is the chief driver of the global temperature increase since the LIA.”

"After two and a half years, the embattled Japanese government and Tepco, the company responsible for the Fukushima nuclear power plant, have sought the world’s assistance in tackling the three damaged reactors. But Japan’s own not-too-distant past includes many examples of disaster recovery that might be instructional. One of the outstanding characteristics of pre-industrial Japan was a highly developed practical understanding of the natural environment. It’s difficult to call this knowledge “scientific” in the modern sense. Rather, it was a body of lore derived from centuries of experience. This emphasised the natural relationships between forest, watercourse, wildlife and soil, and comprised both advice, rules and taboos.  Underlying this traditional approach to forest management was an acute concern for the water system. It recommended villagers make frequent forays into the forest to gather fuel and food and observe the condition of streams, marshes and ponds, understood as necessary for “harmonious coexistence”. Rice crops depended on efficient irrigation systems, and while creating new paddies usually meant clearing forests and constructing waterworks, they were designed to use the area’s natural features and interfere with watercourses as little as possible. Ocean resources were carefully maintained too, with the monitoring of species, seasonal change, and water conditions understood as necessary to maintain the quality and abundance of fish, shellfish and seaweed. But understanding is often not enough to prevent abuse. Two centuries of war in Japan which ended towards the close of the 16th century had left many mountainsides deforested, with the trees cut down to build and rebuild towns and defences. This over-cutting triggered a cascade of serious consequences. Deforested hillsides were unable to modulate rain runoff and snow melt which resulted in disastrous flooding. Riverbanks and irrigation systems, carefully tuned to accommodate typical flows, were frequently washed away, and with them the means of food production. Most goods including food, fuel, and building materials were transported by river, and this was also disrupted. It was an environmental catastrophe. In the following decades the newly centralised government enforced traditional methods, and issued guidelines that trees should be planted wherever they were cut. New riverbank earthworks were designed to better cope with periodic floods. Agricultural techniques were refined in regards to water consumption, soil management, and fertiliser use. Environmental degradation can never be reversed quickly, but by the end of the 17th century these well-integrated practices had supported significant population growth while also improving food production, housing quality, clothing, health, and access to education - all measures usually associated with a rising quality of life. If it seems too good to be true, in a way it was. While this extremely sustainable culture continued for more than 250 years, the practices were gradually abandoned after industrialisation and the development of a large import-export economy. What the Japanese accomplished economically in a short time - twice; once after US gunboats opened the country to the outside world in the 1850s, and again after 1945 - is a remarkable success story. These changes need not have meant abandoning the old sustainable ways, but that’s what happened. From the 1970s, concerted efforts were made to address industrial pollution and the effects of agrochemical use on the country’s rivers. By the eve of the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, many rural communities in Japan were able to boast that they were reviving and adapting traditional, sustainable forestry, watercourse and agriculture practices to contemporary needs. Fukushima Prefecture led the way, and the village of Iitate - now in the abandoned contaminated zone - was a notable success story held up as a model to others. While we should not dismiss entirely the health effects of breathing soot from wood-burning fires, the pre-industrial Japanese simply did not create large-scale pollution. Even major rivers, such as the Sumida which served the capital city of Edo (now Tokyo), remained clean enough to drink, or at least brew tea, until the mid-19th century. While the contaminants released by the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant were unknown to Edo-era Japanese, they may well have been able to grasp the role of the waterways in collecting and transporting them. Numerous radionuclides have been released by the accident, with caesium Cs134 and Cs137 of greatest concern. The forest canopy captured much of what was dispersed by air, from where it will drop with leaves to the forest floor, enter the soil and into the roots of plants, and be passed on into new leaves, flowers and fruit. Radionuclides in nuts, fruits and berries eaten regularly by animals can persist in their flesh for decades, while the proportion excreted reenters the soil to rejoin the cycle. Caesium-contaminated soil or plants that ends up in forest streams is distributed somewhat unpredictably. Some will seep through the riverbed into nearby plants, some is consumed by insects or fish, and most is carried to the ocean where it is eventually dispersed by currents or falls to the seabed. Contaminants are constantly washed downstream, so that ocean fish may consume caesium washed down from mountains dozens or even hundreds of miles inland. The same interdependence of trees, water, plants, and animals that the pre-industrial Japanese understood so well is now the delivery mechanism of many potential long-term poisons. The severity of this environmental disaster lies not so much in the quantity of contaminants, but the fact that they have essentially hijacked the country’s life-support system. Scientists, engineers and volunteer groups like Safecast (of which I am a member) locate and remove these widely dispersed radionuclides. While there have been successes and cause for optimism, most of us look at the forests and despair. It has been seriously suggested that Fukushima’s forests be cut down in a controlled manner, the forest floor remediated, and new forests planted. If this seems excessive, it’s essentially what Japan’s Edo-period forebears did. As then, the benefits would not be seen for generations. Does Japan have the patience and long-term vision necessary to see through this kind of plan? Possibly not. But the radioactive contamination problems will be with us for decades at least. And until we can heal the forests we can’t heal the watercourse, and until we do that, the environmental hijacking will continue."
"When officials at the Environmental Protection Agency began investigating Freedom Performance, LLC, they didn’t have to look very hard for evidence that the company was violating the Clean Air Act. According to legal documents, the Florida car parts distributor literally advertised violations on its website. “The road to hell is often paved with good intentions,” stated one ad for a kit to remove federally required emissions controls from diesel trucks. It identified a particular emissions control system that “is certainly noble in its intent” but “in reality it is putting your engine through hell … The best solution is deletion.”  According to the EPA, Freedom Performance was advertising defeat devices –hardware and software that bypasses or eliminates emission controls. The Clean Air Act forbids tampering with these controls, and violations carry heavy fines. But defeat devices – also known as “delete devices” – are popular with many vehicle owners. Shops advertise that “delete kits” will improve mileage and extend the lifespan of expensive components, saving customers thousands of dollars. In recent years, a lucrative cottage industry of defeat devices has exploded across the US as repair shops, online retailers and manufacturers feed, and generate, consumer demand. The EPA estimates that more than 500,000 diesel pickup trucks have been “deleted” since 2009. The EPA claims that these illegally modified vehicles produced hundreds of thousands of tons of excess nitrogen oxide – the equivalent of adding 9m more trucks to the road. Public health advocates say diesel emissions contribute to increases in fine particulate matter and other airborne pollutants that have been linked to higher rates of cancer, heart attacks, strokes and neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, the EPA has escalated a crackdown, resolving more than 60 cases against companies that make or distribute defeat devices since 2017. The penalties can be stiff: in February, the agency announced that Freedom Performance would pay more than $7m for committing thousands of violations. A managing member of the company, Geoffrey Kemper, did not respond to a request for comment. But the crackdown has left much unresolved. For one, defeat devices can be easily found for sale in brick-and-mortar stores around the country and online. That has led some public health advocates to launch their own litigation under the Clean Air Act. They have targeted body shops featured on the popular Discovery Channel show Diesel Brothers, where some mechanics have customized huge diesel trucks with names like BroDozer and Truck Norris. Enforcement of the defeat device law has triggered pushback from body shops and retailers who say the law is confusing and draconian. The industry is backing a bill in Congress written by lawmakers calling themselves the Motorsports Caucus. The bill claims it would protect the right of motorists to convert a highway vehicle into a race car, but that, opponents say, would hamper EPA enforcement of clean air standards. Once upon a time, turning off the emissions controls in a vehicle was almost as simple as flipping a switch, according to the EPA. But as the agency imposed tighter emissions standards, automakers introduced increasingly sophisticated equipment to reduce pollutants. Nowadays, defeat devices generally come in “delete kits” with hardware and software to use in tandem. “Tuners”, which plug into a vehicle, install software known as “tunes” that changes how a vehicle’s computer regulates emission levels. Physical devices can be installed in a vehicle’s engine or exhaust system; they include “delete pipes”, hollow tubes that bypass or replace equipment containing sensitive filters. Though aftermarket defeat devices have always been illegal, the EPA significantly ramped up enforcement around the time of the most notorious automotive industry fraud of the 21st century: the Volkswagen scandal. In 2013 and 2014, the California government’s air resources board and researchers at West Virginia University discovered that the German automaker had installed a defeat mechanism across its fleet of diesel-engine passenger vehicles. It could detect when the cars were being tested, bringing emissions levels down to regulatory standards. On the road, however, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides – reactive, poisonous gases – than during the tests. Nearly 600,000 of these vehicles were sold or for sale in the US, and the company later admitted it had manufactured about 11m globally. The result was a legal settlement that has cost Volkswagen more than $20bn in the US alone, including criminal and civil penalties and investments in emission reduction projects around the country. “Few companies could survive that litigation,” said John Cruden, assistant attorney general for environment at the time and lead negotiator on the Volkswagen case. “So obviously it has an exceptional deterrent effect.” The ripples have reached smaller operators in the aftermarket parts industry, which makes and installs defeat devices after vehicles are on the road. They range from subsidiaries of major companies such as Polaris Inc to local garages tampering with controls on a few dozen semi trucks. One of the first companies to catch the EPA’s attention was H&S Performance. In 2015, the EPA announced that the Utah manufacturer had agreed to pay a $1m fine for making and selling tens of thousands of defeat devices. According to the consent agreement, the EPA estimated that the H&S tuners had created an additional 71,669 tons of nitrogen oxides. The agency claimed that H&S had committed more than 114,000 violations of the Clean Air Act – one violation for each time H&S sold a defeat device. Over the next five years, the EPA took aim at companies that had manufactured hundreds of thousands of defeat devices. For example, in September 2018, the agency settled a case with a Florida firm called Derive Systems, which allegedly manufactured and sold approximately 363,000 parts. Despite these actions, many companies continue to operate with impunity. The clearest evidence is the sheer number of tuners and straight pipes that appear to be openly sold on e-commerce sites, including eBay, and by users on Facebook’s Marketplace platform.  “All you’ve got to do is Google DPF tuner online and you’ll have a hundred places you can buy it today,” David Sparks, a mechanic who has featured on Diesel Brothers, said in a deposition in a court case. While most sites don’t openly claim that their products bypass emissions controls, eBay vendors sell “delete kits” that do make this boast, despite an eBay policy that forbids the sale of defeat devices. An eBay representative told FairWarning the company would remove the illegal listings, but a search for “delete kits” nearly five weeks later still turned up numerous items for sale.  There is also at least one listing for a “delete kit” on Facebook’s Marketplace platform that remains active days after FairWarning notified the company. Facebook puts the legal onus on Marketplace buyers and sellers, a spokesperson told FairWarning, and only investigates listings when asked by regulators or law enforcement. Discouraged by what they see as the EPA’s limited results, public health advocates in Utah are pursuing a novel strategy to eliminate defeat devices. In 2017, Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment filed what the group claims was the first Clean Air Act citizen suit against companies selling defeat devices. The law allows private citizens to file lawsuits to enforce emissions standards. Their targets included body shops featured on Diesel Brothers. County health department data showed that many diesel trucks were failing emissions tests due to deliberate tampering with pollutant controls, and that a deleted diesel typically produced 36 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed by the EPA. Reed Zars, the attorney who filed the suit, only had to look as far as Instagram and Facebook to find potential violations by some of the companies featured on the TV show. Zars bought one of the trucks that had appeared on the show and took it to an EPA-certified lab in Colorado for emissions testing. The lab discovered that the modified truck emitted 30 to 40 times the limit for various pollutants. The Discovery Channel declined to comment. David Sparks, a body shop owner featured on Diesel Brothers and one of the defendants in the lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment. In March, a court ruled in favor of the physicians’ group, imposing over $850,000 in fines and penalties and forbidding the defendants from selling defeat devices. Last September, the Utah advocacy group went after a bigger target: Tap Worldwide, an aftermarket parts company with dozens of brick-and-mortar outlets across the US. Tap is a subsidiary of Polaris Inc. According to the suit, Tap has repeatedly violated the Clean Air Act by selling and installing defeat devices. The company, which has asked the court to dismiss the case, did not respond to requests for comment. In California, the industry is well aware of state rules that are more stringent than the EPA’s, said Stanley Young, spokesman for the California air resources board. “By now everybody knows how strict California is and anybody who tries to sell unauthorized aftermarket parts in California typically knows that they’re doing it illegally and they have to do it kind of on the down-low,” Young said. The EPA said it had made more than two dozen educational presentations to various industry groups since fall 2019.  But players in the industry and their supporters in Congress continue to promote the idea that the EPA is targeting people who transform their vehicles solely for racing. In October 2019, Congress’s “Motorsports Caucus” introduced a bill to protect the right of motorists to convert their vehicles into race cars – the latest version of legislation that has previously failed. According to public records, the Specialty Equipment Market Association has lobbied for years for Congress to pass such a bill, branding it a commonsense correction to EPA overreach. The EPA stated in an email that it had no interest in cracking down on those who manufacture, sell or install parts that transform street-legal vehicles into race-cars only operated on a track. What is illegal, according to the EPA, is modifying emissions controls in vehicles that will be used on streets and highways. The bill’s opponents believe that rather than clarifying the EPA’s scope, it would make enforcement more difficult. The Congressional Budget Office anticipated that the bill would probably force the EPA to shift its focus from manufacturers and sellers to vehicle users. In the aftermath of the Volkswagen scandal, regulators are devising new ways to catch potential defeat device violations at every level. The California air resources board, for instance, is testing ways to identify trucks exceeding emissions standards even when they’re on the road, Young said. Hi-tech solutions may become an effective form of deterrence. For now, though, many companies are still willing to test the law. On 23 July, the EPA announced that it had busted an Irvine, California, company for manufacturing and distributing defeat devices. This story was produced by FairWarning, a non-profit news organization based in southern California that focuses on public health, consumer, labor and environmental issues.

"We call them wildfires, but that might not be the right word any more. In recent days, at least five whole towns have been destroyed by fire in Oregon. So has much of Malden, Washington, and swathes of Big Creek and Berry Creek, both in California.  To many people this will seem like deja vu. In 2018, another town was also wiped off the map, in the most dramatic recent example of this horrible genre. Paradise, California, was much larger, home to 27,000, and it was destroyed in just a few hours. Eighty-five people were killed. The places now being ravaged are not forests or chaparral located somewhere out there, in the wilds. Instead the current wildfires demonstrate how easy it has become for fires to invade our suburbs and towns, with their 7-11s, gas stations and doctors’ offices, and lay them to waste. Where will this end? The prospects are disturbing. To understand how we got here, it is important to know that we have come to expect control over such conflagrations relatively recently. Prior to European settlement in the West, fire flowed freely, sparked by lightning or intentionally by Native Americans to encourage the growth of favored plants or clear areas for easier hunting. As much as 4.5m acres of California’s 105m acres might burn every year. These low-intensity fires did not kill large trees, and some plants even came to depend on fire to regenerate themselves. A shrub called chamise appears to encourage fire by releasing combustible gases in the presence of flames. The shift to a different approach occurred after several instances in which wildfires became appalling urban fires. In October 1871, railway workers sparked a brush fire in northern Wisconsin, which swept into the city of Peshtigo and killed 1,500 people there and elsewhere across a gargantuan footprint of 1.2 million acres. And in the great fires of 1910, fires burning across several Western states killed hundreds and razed a number of towns. People escaped by train as the fires virtually licked at their heels. After this the US sought to suppress all wildfires before they could gain a foothold. In the 1930s, the US Forest Service instituted its so-called 10am policy, according to which fires had to be stamped out by that time the next day. Later came the “10-acre policy”, dictating that fires should not be permitted to grow beyond that size. Fire was the enemy, an idea catalyzed by wartime imagery of firebombed cities such as Dresden, Hamburg and Tokyo. Smokey Bear helped to reinforce it, too. This strategy had a pronounced effect – though not necessarily in ways that were intended. Fire activity decreased, it is true, but with scouring flames removed from the environment, forests grew far denser and brushier than they had been before. In one Arizona forest, 20 trees per acre became 800 trees per acre. These forests can and will burn more severely. In addition the climate crisis is rendering vegetation ever drier, and by 2050 up to three times more acreage in Western forests will burn as a result of global warming. Meanwhile 60m homes can now be found in or close to high-risk areas where wildfires have previously burned. Cue urban fires. The fire that obliterated Paradise on the morning of November 8, 2018 was sparked in a rural river canyon several miles to the east of town. As we describe in our new book, Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy, it approached the community at speeds previously thought impossible, chewing through almost 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation per minute. It hit like a hurricane. Strikingly, many of the hundreds of thousands of trees in the town were spared – it was the homes that became matches setting fire to the next. The fire was so quick, so hot, that people died seeking shelter under their cars, in the driveways of their homes while holding a hose, or huddled in their bathtub. Lincoln Bramwell, the chief historian of the US Forest Service, told us that the story of Paradise “reads like these accounts from the late 19th century”, of fires like Peshtigo, back before we had sought to bring wildfire under our command. “I see us going back to the future,” he added. “Going back to a time when fire was not under our control.” As Americans in California, Washington and Oregon are discovering, wildfires do not only impact the wilderness. Towns and suburbs are not inviolate. With so many of our Western paradises now under threat, experts are begging us to bring controlled fire back into the ecosystem in the form of prescribed burns. To ensure buildings meet stringent fire codes. And to prepare city evacuation plans so we do not repeat the gridlock in which many of those escaping Paradise were trapped. We must, it almost goes without saying, get a handle on the climate crisis. Witnessing the urban fire in Paradise, some of those we interviewed for our book no longer thought it fanciful that a fire that could maraud into the very heart of a major city, such as Los Angeles, San Diego or the communities of the San Francisco Bay. University of California scientist Faith Kearns recounted to us that she lives in the Berkeley flatlands, in a part of the Bay that is as thoroughly urbanized as can be. Suddenly she was considering the prospect that a fire might one day reach her home. “My neighborhood is full of Victorians. My neighbor’s window is about six feet away from my own…” she said, pausing in thought. “I think we’ll see it. I think we’ll see it.” Alastair Gee and Dani Anguiano are the authors of Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy, available from WW Norton. Read an excerpt here"

The Week That Was: 2016-10-29 (October 29, 2016) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Constitutional Tug-of-War: During the turmoil following the Revolutionary War, which ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, it became evident to many of the political leaders that the central government under the Articles of Confederation was not working as hoped. A stronger central government was needed. In a 1787 prolonged meeting, later called the Constitutional Convention, many leaders participated to form a new charter to make a more effective central government. Of the many participating, one of the most important was James Madison, a scholar of history and political theorist. During the process from the drafting of the Constitution in May 1787, to its adoption in September, and its implementation in 1789, many ideas emerged. During the period of ratification, Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton wrote the very influential essays now called the Federalist Papers. Others, opposing ratification of the Constitution, wrote essays now collected and called the Anti-Federalist Papers. Probably, the now best-known of the anti-Federalists was Patrick Henry. These skeptics gave rise to the Bill of Rights, which articulate specific human rights upon which the central government cannot infringe. Madison did not perceive a need for the Bill of Rights because he believed human rights are many, broad, and well-established and that the proposed Constitution clearly restricted the powers of the Federal government so that it could not interfere with those rights.
This history demonstrates the conflicts (or constant tug of war) between the human rights and the need for social order; between powers of the central government and the powers of state governments; and between various parts of the central government. Underlying this, was the desire to create a democratically elected central government but with sufficient protections of human rights so that the government would not degenerate into mob rule, tyrannies, or dictatorships as happened in ancient Greece, later in France in 1789-99, and 20th century Europe. These conflicts, or tugs of war, are ongoing in the US today. No document written by man is perfect.
In the above context, it is interesting to read the constitutional, oral arguments made by the petitioners (opponents) to the administration’s power plan before the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. David Rivkin argued on behalf of state petitioners and Lawrence Tribe argued on behalf of non-state petitioners. They hit upon many of the issues of the tug of war between the powers of the central government and the powers of the several states. This conflict is intensified by the executive officer, President Obama, failing to obtain consent of Congress for his power plan – in fact ignoring Congress. Of particular interest; were the exchanges between Tribe, a legal icon of liberals, and the liberals on the court, chiefly Judge Tatel.
Among key issues discussed was responsibility for the electrical grid. In general, the several states are responsible for insuring the delivery of reliable electricity through the grid, with many interconnections crossing state borders. Although the federal government participates, through several entities such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates interstate transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas, it is not held accountable for failure of delivery to customers. State entities are held accountable.
Several times Judge Tatel, and others, brought up the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as an example of federal laws requiring changes in state and local regulations. Whether the judges believe it or not, there is a considerable difference between ADA and the administration’s power plan.
One, the ADA was an act of Congress, the administration’s power plan is not. Instead, it is an attempt to manipulate the Clean Air Act into justifying the power plan – and the EPA claim that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, which the EPA failed to establish empirically. Some of the judges considered the “Endangerment Finding” of the EPA to be equivalent to an act of Congress.
Two, as stated by the judges, the ADA required establishments to overcome physical barriers to use, usually with physical structures such as concrete ramps. The electrical grid includes multiple physical points of generation from different sources, but it is much more than that. The electrical current is fleeting; it can fail in fractions of a second. For example, South Australia’s Black System experienced some parts tripping within one tenth of a second, six cycles in a sixty cycle per second grid, with the whole system failing in 88 seconds. Electrical stability is fleeting. Wind power adds to instability.
Although the administration and the EPA are claiming authority over the grid, the EPA does not have the resources to take responsibility, or take accountability. See links under The Administration’s Plan – Litigation, Energy Issues – Australia, and last week’s TWTW.

Executive Agreements: When President Obama signed the Paris Agreement, his staff argued that there is no reason to present it to the Senate for approval, because it is an Executive Agreement, not a Treaty, which would require approval of two-thirds of the Senate. The claim prompted some examination, not exhaustive, into the scope and nature of Executive Agreements under the Constitution.
Some sources state the first executive agreement was the Jay Treaty, or Treaty of London of 1794, designed to encourage commerce and navigation between Britain and the US. It was signed in 1794, was very controversial, and became effective in February 1796. Also, it called for the withdrawal of British Army forces from pre-Revolutionary War forts in the Northwest Territory (now the upper Mid-West). However, the Jay Treaty was approved by two-thirds of the US Senate in November 1794, and was not an Executive Agreement when it went into force.
Other types of major executive agreements tend to be in times of armed conflict, or before and after armed conflict, or trade agreements. For example, President Wilson agreed to the Treaty of Versailles concluding World War I. This agreement was an extension of the Paris Peace Conference, and called for punitive reparations from Germany, contributing to the hostility leading to World War II. US Senators were not included in the negotiations for the Treaty, and the US Senate rejected it.
War-time executive agreements include President Roosevelt’s lend-lease of destroyers to the United Kingdom. Roosevelt consulted with congressional leaders and Republican candidates for President and VP, which was considered a matter of national security. Also, the war time occupation of Greenland and protection of Iceland came under Executive Agreements. Following World War II, Congressional action called the Bricker Amendment attempted to prevent Executive Agreements, but failed when President Eisenhower rejected it.
Documents reviewed assert that during the 1980s and 1990s the United States completed 6,796 international agreements, of which only 415, or 6.1 percent, were treaties submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. Additionally, the State Department has been lax in reporting executive agreements. The most important trade agreements are completed as congressional-executive agreements, including NAFTA, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the Central American Free Trade Agreement. These sources state that congressional-executive agreements require approval by both houses of Congress, but not the more rigid two-thirds approval of the Senate, as required by treaties.
Marlo Lewis, of CEI, explored some of agreements listed by the State Department, and found them to be minor, requiring little commitment by the United States.
As s side note: Human rights agreements are treated as treaties.
For the US, the Paris Agreement is major – requiring significant restructuring of the electricity generation system and, curtailment of various industries and economic activity, to the detriment of the general population. Unless utility scale electricity storage becomes affordable, the Paris Agreement can be hazardous to the general population. Yet, President Obama appears to be ignoring his Constitutional responsibilities and accountability of presenting the Paris Agreement to the US Senate for approval as a treaty. He has not even presented it to Congress as a congressional-executive agreement. See links under The Administration’s Plan – Executive Agreements

Electricity Storage: On his blog, Rational Optimist, Matt Ridley has an easy-to-read overview of the problems of electricity storage – storage that is critical to make wind and solar reliable in most areas. In the clear deserts, with reliable sunshine, industrial solar using molten salt may work, but it is yet to be demonstrated.
Although specific to cloudy UK, Ridley describes the problems and costs in a manner generally understandable to politicians – how massive are the subsidies required for your scheme to work? See links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Storage.
****************
The Energy Policy Act of 2005: The 2005 Energy Policy Act has received a great deal of derision from greens because it exempted hydraulic fracturing (fracking) fluids from Federal control under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA also called Superfund)
Not mentioned by those attacking it is that the Act authorizes innovative technologies to avoid greenhouse gases, expands biofuel programs, clean coal, authorizes tax credits for wind and other electricity producers, such as wave and tidal power, and has other “green” provisions. The bipartisan act received a 249 to 183 vote in the House and a 74 to 26 vote in the Senate.
Since then, after a short lag, oil and gas production on lands not controlled by the federal government has soared, while production on federally controlled lands and waters have stagnated. The growth in oil and gas production is largely due to hydraulic fracturing, and oil imports have been falling since 2006.

****************
Bizarre Decision? Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a lower court ruling from 2014 and upheld the 2012 decision by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to designate the bearded seal as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
Reports state: “The ruling is an important victory for the Obama administration and could help build a precedent of using climate change forecasts for decisions like species protections.
 
“’This case turns on one issue: When NMFS determines that a species that is not presently endangered will lose its habitat due to climate change by the end of the century, may NMFS list that species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act’ the appeals court asked in its ruling, answering in the affirmative.
 
“’The fact that climate projections for 2050 through 2100 may be volatile does not deprive those projections of value in the rulemaking process,’ the court wrote. ‘The ESA does not require NMFS to make listing decisions only if underlying research is ironclad and absolute.’”
Is the court is so engrossed in the mathematical beauty of models, that the judges believe that the mathematics constitutes physical evidence? Perhaps in future cases on oil regulations, the oil industry can introduce government energy models of the 1970s, which forecast the world will run out of oil by the end of last century, as proof that the industry no longer exists and the regulations in question are moot. See links under Litigation Issues.

Defending the Orthodoxy
A 1912 news article ominously forecasted the catastrophic effects of fossil fuels on climate change
By Staff Writers, Quartz, Oct 24, 2016 [H/t Clyde Spencer]
https://www.yahoo.com/news/1912-news-article-ominously-forecasted-143125640.html
[SEPP Comment: A great comparison between 1912 & 2016. The 1912 the photo shows coal-fired power blackening the skies and that CO2 emissions will cause drastic caused global warming, based on the science of that time. Except in special photos emphasizing condensing steam, modern coal fired-power plants emit only invisible gases. Similarly, modern empirical science is showing little or no warming from CO2, except in illusionary climate models.]

“Weatherwatch: Did warm weather cause the Titanic disaster?
But in fact the catastrophe may have been set in motion by a warm, wet year over Greenland in 1908, resulting in greater snow accumulation.
Writing in the journal Weather, Grant Bigg and David Wilton of Sheffield University explain how the snow soaked through cracks in the ice sheet, encouraging excess iceberg calving over the following few years.
Soberingly, global warming has increased iceberg hazard greatly in recent decades, making years like 1912 more the norm than the exception.”

1. North Korean Coal Windfall Boosts Nuclear Advance
New mineral riches complicate Washington-Beijing talks over how to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear program
By Alastair Gale, WSJ, Oct 25, 2016
http://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korean-coal-windfall-boosts-nuclear-advance-1477387708
[SEPP Comment: An unintended consequence of the Obama – China Agreement (not approved by Congress)?]
Summary: The article states:
“North Korean coal prices have surged by 68% in value recently, boosting funds for Pyongyang’s advancing nuclear program and undermining U.S.-led efforts to force it into talks by choking its finances.
 
“The rise for North Korea’s biggest export gives fresh significance to talks between the U.S. and China about tightening sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear activities. A focus of those talks at the United Nations is how to close a loophole that allows North Korean coal to flow to China largely unhindered.
 
“China buys most of North Korea’s goods, including coal, which accounts for about a third—or $1 billion—of the value of Pyongyang’s exports, according to Chinese data. 
 
“In recent weeks, the coal trade has become significantly more lucrative for North Korea. The average price of its anthracite coal arriving at major Chinese ports rose to $99 a ton in recent weeks from around $59 in early August, according to financial data provider Wind Information.
 
“This is swelling North Korea’s coffers as it presses ahead with its nuclear program despite international condemnation. Pyongyang has spent around $200 million on its nuclear and missile program this year, the head of South Korea’s spy agency said last week, including two nuclear detonations and a long-range rocket launch. It has pledged further tests.”

2. Big Oil Companies Reap Windfall From Ethanol Rules
Some refiners stand to rake in $1 billion by selling fuel credits, while others must spend millions to comply
By Bradley Olson, WSJ, Oct 27, 2016
http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-oil-companies-reap-windfall-from-ethanol-rules-1477564201
[SEPP Comment: No link to study. The biofuels program is in the Energy Act of 2005, but expanded later. Once adapted, a government program is difficult to eliminate, even when scientifically wrong and worthless.]
Summary: The article states:
“Environmental regulations designed to boost the amount of ethanol blended into the U.S. gasoline supply have inadvertently become a multibillion-dollar windfall for some of the world’s biggest oil companies.
“Companies including Chevron Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and BP PLC could reap a total of more than $1 billion this year by selling the renewable fuel credits associated with the ethanol program, according to an analysis commissioned by CVR Energy, a refinery operator controlled by billionaire Carl Icahn, a vocal critic of the rules. 
“For other companies, especially smaller refiners, the rules have had the opposite effect, forcing them to spend hundreds of millions to buy credits to comply.
“Some large oil companies acknowledge they are reaping revenue from the regulations, but say their advantage stems from large investments they made to comply with it, and stress that not all of the money translates into profit.
“The top 10 U.S. refiners spent $1.1 billion on biofuel credits in the first half of this year, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Some refiners have warned they could be forced to conduct mass layoffs, or file for bankruptcy, because of the soaring costs of compliance.
“But the dispute over how to fix the program has created a rift in the oil industry, pitting some of the world’s biggest oil companies against smaller refiners. BP and the American Petroleum Institute have opposed the change, saying it could introduce significant uncertainty and do little to create incentives to blend ethanol. Exxon Mobil Corp. has argued the best solution would be repealing the entire program.”

"A new study sheds light on why natural spaces in cities can help keep us healthy. Researchers found that people living in neighbourhoods with a large amount of green space, such as parks or playing fields, had lower stress levels. They also found that women were particularly affected: those with little neighbourhood green space showed higher stress levels than men in the same situation.  The research is part of wider efforts to understand why green space seems to be good for many aspects of human health. There is good evidence from the UK and elsewhere that suggests it leads to lower blood pressure, better mental health, and reduced risks of being overweight or dying from heart disease. Importantly, this relationship remains after researchers account for how affluent or deprived an area is. When we consider the growing impact on society of the sort of chronic illnesses that green space could help to reduce, it’s easy to see why there’s so much interest in the connection. But how, exactly, does green space benefit our health? The jury is still out on this one, but there are a few key suspects (and they may all be in on it together). First, green spaces may encourage us to be more physically active, such as going for a walk or a jog. Second, they may enhance our opportunities for social interaction with others.  And third, they may help to relieve stress and mental fatigue. Each of these - lack of exercise, poor social relationships and stress - are known to lead to health problems, so it’s not surprising that improving them could improve our health. This latest study pursued the stress-relieving hypothesis, by investigating how different amounts of green space in a neighbourhood related to the stress levels of unemployed people living in deprived areas of Dundee, Scotland. The research team was led by Dr Jenny Roe of Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, along with members from the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Westminster, the James Hutton Institute and Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland. The levels of the hormone cortisol in participants’ saliva were measured every three hours, as it is a good indicator of stress levels. Cortisol concentrations peak in the early morning and subsequently decline through the day: individuals with more stress exhibit slower declines than less stressed people. To complement the tests a questionnaire survey was also used to measure perceptions of their own stress levels. It transpired that both men and women in neighbourhoods with more green space had lower levels of self-reported stress and sharper declines of cortisol than those in less green areas. So it seems that living in a greener area appeared to counteract at least some of the negative effects of urban deprivation. It’s well known that poverty and living in a poor environment is bad for health, so this finding is very significant. Researchers in the Netherlands also found evidence that green spaces can provide a cushion against the negative health impact of stressful life events. And an earlier study in England found that excess deprivation-related mortality – the “health gap” between the richest and poorest – was smallest in the greenest neighbourhoods. How this occurred was unclear. This new study contributes one promising explanation: that large amounts of greenery promote better health in deprived populations. Interestingly, those participants in the study living in areas with little green space were more stressed overall, but women were especially so. They not only self-described as more stressed than men in the questionnaire, but their cortisol measurements indicated chronic stress and exhaustion. The results clearly suggest that women take the absence of green, open spaces harder than men. As five times as many women in the study were caring for family than were men, a shortage of local parks and play spaces for children may have affected women more keenly. But this needs further investigation. By adding to the evidence for the stress-relieving properties and health benefits of green space, this study adds to the body of research that should inform urban planning and health policies in our cities. More work like this is needed to fine-tune such policies, by asking how green spaces influence stress in different places and among different population groups. A point that needs particular attention is the comparison of quality versus quantity, as other studies suggest that it is the quality of green space that drives women to use and therefore benefit from it, and this will be an important factor in the provisions made by town planners."
"The sky was the muddy yellow of an old bruise at 7am in San Francisco on Wednesday, and by eight it was a dull orange and the darkness that felt like night was coming on. This morning was perhaps the most unnatural-feeling and unnerving of my life, with darkness rather than daytime rolling in. People around California reported that the birds that would normally be singing were silent. On some of the days, since the freak lightning storm in the heat wave of mid-August launched this explosive fire season, the sun has been red, and when the moon was full it was also red near the horizon, but this morning there was no sun to be seen through the murk. Ash was falling, the ash of trees, forests, homes, towns, dreams burning up. In the strange light, the world around us looked ghostly, otherworldly, unnatural, unnerving, disturbing.  I know that the smoke, the light, and the heat have been worse almost everywhere else in the Bay Area from friends and family, and beyond the inner Bay Area are fires, blackouts, evacuations, and more than 14,000 firefighters doing their best against a monstrous new kind of wildfire. What is happening now is astonishingly worse than the western fire season ever has been before. There are catastrophic fires in Oregon –burning down a small town and prompting the evacuation of much of the small city of Medford. Near Oroville in northeastern California, a fire expanded by a quarter million acres in 24 hours, so far as the experts can tell. That is a new kind of fire and we are in a new kind of era. This is the fourth year of a climate-crisis fire season amplified in duration, scale, and intensity, and it is already worse than the last three in most respects. It comes on the heels of unprecedented heat throughout most of California, with temperatures most of us never expected – 121F (49.4C) in Los Angeles County last week. I have lived in San Francisco all my adult life, which has meant living in relationship to the Pacific and its damp cool breath in the form of our famous fog. Often in summertime the rising heat inland sucks the cool air off the ocean in the form of fog, so that you can be eating soup in a sweater in a world without shadows and know that 10 miles east someone in shorts is sweating under a bright blue sky. Lately I have not known if I was looking at fog or smoke, friend or foe, when I saw a gray sky, until I went out into it. On Wednesday, a marine layer of damp fog spread over the Bay Area with smoke atop it, creating the strange dimness that now weighs us down. Here the ocean is a beloved ally, bringing us cool fresh clean air—and most of our weather comes from over the Pacific – but we are not the ocean’s ally: the world’s oceans have soaked up most of the heat climate change has produced, with disastrous consequences, including intensified hurricanes and typhoons elsewhere. And even the ocean cannot save us now: the autumn winds – the Diablo winds here in central California, the Santa Ana winds in southern California – are due to bring scorching air from the arid east that will amplify fires. We are early in our fire season and already the records are broken. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, who tweets regularly about weather and climate said on Wednesday morning, “Everyone is so far beyond capacity right now, and there so much else going on, that I don’t think the collective bandwidth exists right now to process what it happening. I really do feel like we’re running a marathon at sprint pace right now. It is deeply exhausting.” And “Standard reporting/mapping procedures are essentially not capable of keeping pace with the unbelievable rates of spread now being observed on these fires – it is historically unprecedented.” The night before he had tweeted, “The wildfire situation in California and Oregon has now escalated to the point that I can no longer keep track of the countless massive, fast-moving, and potentially very dangerous fires.” Pacific Gas and Electric, the utility company responsible for horrific fires in previous years, including the one that completely destroyed the town of Paradise in 2018, has been deploying its new strategy of cutting off electricity to prevent its poorly maintained equipment from starting fires in hot, dry, windy conditions. This prompted local public news station KQED to run a story with the headline, “How to Prepare for Power Shutoffs During a Heat Wave and a Pandemic.” The pandemic made us move a lot of life outdoors, but the fires create air so bad that staying indoors is safer. There we check the AQI, the air quality index, or follow the fires online. Of course for the homeless and the displaced, indoors is not so easy to come by, and during a pandemic providing emergency shelter is a far more complicated business. Some of the people facing evacuation or worse in the Oroville-area fire resettled there after their homes in Paradise burned down. In Sonoma County people who had to evacuate in previous years are prepared to evacuate again. Californians have loved their landscapes and many of us chose to live as close to wild places as we could; insurance costs and fire danger may take that option off the table for many of us; and cities are right now the safest place to be. Some small rural communities have burned up. A farmer whose produce I have been buying for perhaps 15 years lost his buildings, including his home, and equipment on the Santa Cruz coast. His crops survived, but when I went to his booth Sunday he was hunched and avoiding eye contact, clearly stricken. The toll takes many forms from loss of life to loss of homes and communities to displacement and disruption to, even for those who are not technically impacted, the dread and dismay of living in this whole new hell. It was 10 years ago now that Bill McKibben published a book titled Earth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet. To try to explain the enormity and peril of climate change, he described the transition as though we had landed on a chaotic, hostile new planet he dubbed Eaarth. This week, with snow throughout the intermountain west fast on the heels of a wave of record-breaking heat, firestorms up and down the west coast sending huge smoke plumes across state and national borders, and a hurricane-force windstorm knocking down thousands of trees in Salt Lake City, I have thought of his book and its premise often. An aerial photograph today would show California and Oregon mostly smothered under smoke, but politically, along with Washington, we are the blue wall of the United States, the solidly democratic region where state policy recognizes and responds to climate change. From here, under the dark orange sky, I hope that all this leads to a dramatic escalation in climate action, regionally, nationally, and internationally. It’s the only thing that can help on the scale that help is needed. Rebecca Solnit is a US Guardian columnist. She is also the author of Men Explain Things to Me and The Mother of All Questions.

"**Hong Kong police have made their first arrests under a new ""anti-protest"" law imposed by Beijing, as crowds marked 23 years since the end of British rule.**
Ten people were held accused of violating the law, including a man with a pro-independence flag. About 360 others were detained at a banned rally.
The national security law targets secession, subversion and terrorism with punishments up to life in prison.
Activists say it erodes freedoms but China has dismissed the criticism.
Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 and certain rights were supposed to be guaranteed for at least 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.
The UK has now said up to three million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship.
On Wednesday, thousands gathered for the annual pro-democracy rally to mark the handover anniversary, defying a ban by authorities who cited restrictions on gatherings of more than 50 people because of Covid-19.
Police used water cannon, tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators. Seven officers were injured, including one officer who was stabbed in the arm by ""rioters holding sharp objects"", police said. The suspects fled and bystanders offered no help, they added.
One of the 10 arrested under the new law, adopted in the wake of last year's widespread unrest, was holding a ""Hong Kong Independence"" flag. However, some Twitter users said the picture appeared to show a small ""no to"" written in front of the slogan. The man has not been identified, and it was not clear whether he would be prosecuted.
The legislation has been condemned by numerous countries and human rights activists.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the measures a ""flagrant assault"" on freedoms of speech and protest.
The UK has also updated its travel advice on Hong Kong, saying there is an ""increased risk of detention, and deportation for a non-permanent resident"".
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China had broken its promise to Hong Kong's people.
But in Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged countries to look at the situation objectively and said China would not allow foreign interference in its domestic affairs.
Crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces are punishable by a minimum sentence of three years, with the maximum being life. It also says:
Beijing will also have power over how the law should be interpreted, and not any Hong Kong judicial or policy body. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority.
Zhang Xiaoming, executive deputy director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the law would not be applied to offences committed before it was passed and that suspects arrested in Hong Kong on charges of violating the law may be tried on the mainland.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader, said the law would ""restore stability"" and that it was ""considered the most important development in relations between the central government and Hong Kong since the handover"".
Demonstrators in the Causeway Bay district chanted ""resist till the end"" and ""Hong Kong independence"", with police using a flag to warn protesters that certain slogans and banners might now constitute serious crimes.
Ahead of the protest, pro-democracy activist Tsang Kin-shing, of the League of Social Democrats, warned there was a ""large chance of our being arrested"", saying: ""The charges will not be light, please judge for yourself.""
A man who gave his name as Seth, 35, told Reuters: ""I'm scared of going to jail but for justice I have to come out today, I have to stand up.""
**By Michael Bristow, BBC World Service Asia-Pacific editor**
The law gives Beijing extensive powers to shape life in the territory that it has never had before. It not only introduces a series of tough punishments for a long list of crimes, it changes the way justice is administered.
Trials can be held in secret - and without a jury. Judges can be handpicked. The law reverses a presumption that suspects will be granted bail. There appears to be no time limit on how long people can be held.
Crimes are described in vague terms, leading to the possibility of broad interpretation, and the right to interpret lies only in Beijing. Foreign nationals outside of Hong Kong face prosecution.
Most cases will be handled in Hong Kong, but the mainland can take over ""complex"", ""serious"" or ""difficult"" cases. Whether or not you think the legislation was necessary, it is impossible to deny its significance. As Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam put it: this is a turning point.
Minutes after the law was passed on Tuesday, pro-democracy activists began to quit, fearful of the punishment the new law allows.
Ted Hui, an opposition legislator, told the BBC: ""Our freedom is gone, our rule of law, our judicial independence is gone"".
The EU expressed ""grave concerns"" that the law could ""seriously undermine"" the city's independence.
In the US, lawmakers from both parties have launched a bill to give refugee status to Hong Kong residents at risk of persecution, reported local media outlets.
Taiwan's government has said it will set up a special office to help those in Hong Kong facing immediate political risks."

 **[Sunanda Creagh  
](https://theconversation.com/au/team#sunanda-creagh)**[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-and-covid-19-your-questions-answered-by-virus-experts-133617)



What do you need to know about COVID-19 and coronavirus? We asked our readers for their top questions and sought answers from two of Australia’s leading virus and vaccine experts.



Today’s podcast episode features Professor Michael Wallach and Dr Lisa Sedger – both from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Technology, Sydney – answering questions from you, our readers. An edited transcript is below.



 **Sunanda Creagh:** Hi, I’m Sunanda Creagh. I’m the Digital Storytelling editor at The Conversation, and I’m here today with two of Australia’s leading researchers on viruses and vaccines. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Hi, my name’s Lisa Sedger. I’m an academic virologist at the University of Technology Sydney. And I do research on novel anti-viral agents and teach virology. 



**Michael Wallach:** I’m Professor Michael Wallach, the Associate Head of School for the School of Life Science (at the University of Technology Sydney) and my expertise in the area of development of vaccines. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And today, we’re asking these researchers to answer questions about coronavirus and COVID-19 from you guys, our readers and our audience. We’re going to kick it off with Dr. Sedger. Adam would like to know: how long can this virus survive in various temperatures on a surface, say, a door handle or a counter at a public place? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Oh, well, that’s an interesting question, because we hear a variety of answers. Some people say that these types of envelope viruses can exist for two to three days, but it really depends on the amount of moisture and humidity and what happens on that surface afterwards, whether it’s wiped off or something. So potentially for longer than that, potentially up to a week. But with cleaning and disinfectants, etc, not very long. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And what’s an envelope virus? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Well, viruses are basically nucleic acid. So DNA like is in all of the cells in our body or RNA. And then they have a protein coat and then outside of that they have an envelope that’s made of lipids. So it’s just an outer layer of the virus. And if it’s made of lipids, you can imagine any kind of detergent like when you’re doing your dishes, disrupts all the lipids in the fat. That’s how you get all the grease off your plates. Right? So any detergent like that will disrupt the envelope of the virus and make it non-infective. So cleaning surfaces is a good way to try and eliminate an infective virus particle from, for example, door handles, surfaces, et cetera. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Professor Wallach, Paul would like to know: should people cancel travel plans given that this virus is already here? Does travelling make the spread worse? And that’s international travel or domestic travel. 



**Michael Wallach:** So this question has come up to many different governments from around the world who’ve reacted very differently. Australia’s been very strategic in banning travel to certain places. And of course, those places you would not want to travel to at the time when there’s an outbreak like China, Italy, Iran, etc.. I was also asked the question on ABC Tasmania: should the Tasmanians restrict domestic travel to Tasmania? At the time, they had a single case. And I said to them, if you have one case, you most likely have more. You will not prevent the entry of the virus into Tasmania. But what restricting travel can do is restrict the number of people who are seeding that area with virus and make it more manageable. So it’s a question of timing. As I was saying to you earlier, the cost-benefit of closing off travel has to be weighed very carefully because the economic impacts are very great. So I think it’s a case by case basis. Ultimately, the planet is now seeded. And we’re moving into the stage of exponential growth and that it will affect travel very severely, where in all likelihood, travel will be very much curtailed now. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And this question’s from our reader, David. He wants to know: with the flu killing more people each year than coronavirus and mostly the same demographic, why is this outbreak receiving so much attention? Can’t we just catch the flu just as easily without cancelling events and travel plans? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yes, and I understand the question. Flu exists. We get it seasonally every year and then we get pandemic flu. And yes, people do die from influenza. I think it was 16,000 people in the US died last US winter. But the issue with this virus is that we don’t yet know how to treat it particularly well. We’re trialling anti-viral drugs in China at the very moment. There’s clinical trials on experimental drugs. There’s drugs that doctors are using. But until that data comes in and we actually know what regime of anti-viral drugs (are best) to use, then we don’t really yet know how to treat it with anti-viral drugs. The other thing is with flu, we have a vaccine. People can take the vaccine. Somebody gets sick in their family, the other family members can take the vaccine and prevent the spread of the virus. So the difference is with flu, we have ways to control it. We know about the disease. We know how it presents. This virus, we’re still understanding the clinical presentation and in different cohorts. So different age groups, different countries, different situations, we’re still understanding the symptoms. And we don’t yet fully know how to control it by antivirals. And we don’t have a vaccine yet. 



**Michael Wallach:** Can I just add to that a bit? I think one of the reasons we’re being so careful is when it broke and Wuhan, at the beginning the mortality rate was extremely high. And with related viruses like SARS, and MERS that went as high as 35%, whereas flu mortality rates is usually around 0.1%. So it was that very high mortality rate that gave a real shock. Had it continued, it would have been devastating. We’re very fortunate that now we see it dropping down to the 2 to 3% level and some say much lower. 



**Lisa Sedger:** And we also know now that some people get COVID, have very minimal symptoms and almost don’t even know that they’ve been sick. So I think that fear and anxiety, in that sense, is lowering. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Molly wants to know: how far off is a vaccine? 



**Michael Wallach:** So, we are working on vaccines in Australia. The group in Melbourne was the first to be able to isolate and grow the virus. And I’ve been in touch with them, in fact, this morning. We’re working collaboratively nationally as well as internationally, collaborating with people at Stanford Medical School who through Stanford, in collaborations we have with them, we have worldwide about 15 vaccine projects going, plus all sorts of industry companies are aiming to make vaccines. In fact, one company in Israel early on announced that they believe that they can get to a vaccine within a few weeks. The problem with the vaccine is you may produce it even quickly, but it’s testing it and making sure that it’s actually going to help. There’s a fear, with COVID-19, that if it is not formulated correctly, to make a long story short, it can actually exacerbate the disease. So everyone has to take it slowly and carefully so that we don’t actually cause more problems than we currently have. But I’m optimistic and believe that we’ll get there. The WHO declared it would take 18 months. I would like to present a more optimistic view, not based on anything that substantial, but I think we can do better than that. And it is a great learning curve for the next time this happens. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Can I make a comment on that, too? Recently, we’ve just seen Africa experience a very significant outbreak of Ebola virus, and there’s been an experimental vaccine that’s been administered that has largely controlled that outbreak. I think the people working in vaccines and the people who do the safety and efficacy studies, we’ve learnt a lot from how to administer vaccines, how to get the data we need to show safety more quickly than we might have in the past. So in the sense we’ve learnt, we’re learning lessons constantly from viral outbreaks. It might not be the same virus, might not be the same country, even the same continent. But we’re learning how to do these things more efficiently and more quickly. And always the issue is weighing up safety versus the ethics of the need to administer all get it, get the drug out there as quickly as possible. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** This reader asks: isn’t lining up at fever clinics for tests just going to spread it even more?



 **Michael Wallach:** So for sure, the way in which people are processed at clinics is crucial and the minimal distance you should keep from a person who’s infected is, according again to the WHO, is one metre. So the clinics have to ensure that spread is minimised, not only spread between people waiting in line, but to the health workers themselves. We’ve had real problems for health workers in China. Several died. And we face that problem here. One of the things we have to do is ensure that we protect our health workers because otherwise they’re not going to want to go in and actually see the patients. Unfortunately, masks alone do not work. We can’t rely on them. So it’s a problem. In Israel, for example, testing for COVID-19, takes place in one’s home. An ambulance pulls up and takes the swab and then takes it to the lab. That actually would be the ideal approach. True, the ambulance services in Israel now are swamped and having great difficulty in coping. But as much as we can keep people separated from each other when they’re infected, it’s crucial for the success of any campaign. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And these questions from Jake. He wants to know for people like myself living in Victoria. How likely is it that we can catch the virus and is hand-washing really the only thing we can be doing to protect ourselves? 



**Lisa Sedger:** I think we now know that the virus is definitely in Australia. If you go to the New South Wales or Victorian Health government websites, you can see them update the statistics daily, even less than a day so that the truth is it’s here and it’s probably in more people than we realise because we haven’t tested as many people and we now realise some people are asymptomatic or don’t show classic flu like symptoms. So it’s here and you can’t say that you’re not going to get sick. Alright? That’s the first thing to say. The second thing is, though, we can minimise what we do. Okay. So we can wash our hands constantly. We can try not to touch our face, our eyes, our ears, our nose. We’ve learned, for example, even how do you dispose of a tissue when you sneeze or cough or, you know, sneeze into your elbow? So it’s just about common sense. This is what I think. It’s no different really than protecting yourself from any respiratory virus infection. So seasonal flu or even a pandemic flu. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And how do you dispose of a tissue safely? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Well, I guess you fold it in and then you put – you don’t touch it, you don’t put it up your sleeve, OK? – you put it in the garbage bin and wash your hands afterwards. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** Michael would like to know: what can we learn from other countries that are handling this well? He says basically South Korea, as far as I can tell. 



**Michael Wallach:** So the country that handled this outbreak the best so far has been Taiwan. The Taiwanese have been amazing in the sense that after the pandemic commenced in China, many Taiwanese returned to Taiwan. And you would have expected they’d seed that island very strongly and it would be a major outbreak. They were ready before the pandemic commenced. And that was largely because they went through a SARS outbreak. Previously, they had in place all the testing, all the people. They have the best health system in the world. And they kept the numbers down to 45 cases during a period when in China it was going into the tens of thousands. And they should be commended on that. It’s quite amazing the way they did that. The issue now in Taiwan, which concerns them, is in the end, that’s a great start. But their population now is unexposed and susceptible. So how do you release them from this sort of quarantine situation? That is the next phase. And that’s what we’re looking to see how that works, because same in Wuhan. The minute you put everyone back out to work and in the street, will there be a second wave? Most virologists, I think, would expect there will be a major second wave, third wave and maybe continued into the future. So we have to continue with our preparedness and with the hope that the vaccine will come into effect sooner rather than later. And then bringing the quarantine approach, enabling that peak of viral infection to occur when the vaccine is available. That would be the goal. 



**Lisa Sedger:** If I could just add one point there. When you look at the number of cases on a per day basis in Wuhan, it was escalating very quickly. And then they brought in their very strict quarantine and self-isolation. But the cases continued to increase until a point where it started to look like it was under control and going down. And that was after two weeks. So quarantine only works until after the quarantine period, because only after that will you see the effect. So I would argue there’s two factors for why isolation worked in Wuhan: One was you limited the spread through the self-isolation and imposed quarantine, but at the same time, the number of people who are infected and asymptomatic were building their own immunity. The number of people who were infected and sick but who survived, one would imagine, have a robust immune response to that virus. So at the same time as limiting spread, you have also slowly built or actually quite quickly built a community with much higher levels of what we call herd immunity. So this second outbreak may come, but it may be considerably less significant. 



**Michael Wallach:** In fact, that the areas where there are the major outbreaks maybe have better herd immunity than places where you keep it down to nothing. So it works both ways. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Jane would like to know: when do we stop testing for this disease and basically just assume that everybody with the sniffles has it?



 **Michael Wallach:** So first of all, the major symptoms are not sniffles, they are fever and coughing and shortness of breath. It’s the sniffles, though, that causes it to be spreadable more easily. That’s a good question: what the health authorities will decide to do at various stages of this pandemic. We’re now at what I would consider the early seeding phase. The world is now seeded with virus and different countries were going through exponential phases like described in Wuhan at different times. And how do they handle that will be a crucial question. I’ve seen all the different approaches from US, Israel, Iran. I think that a mixture of very strategic quarantine with travel restrictions, with bringing in other types of… certainly health authorities will need to control the number of beds that are being occupied. For example, again, in Israel, they just went over their bed limits, so patients are starting to be treated at home. So at some point, I think depending on how the epidemic goes, if we can keep it under control, we can keep the testing going. We can keep control. If the exponential rise is too fast, we will lose control and the testing will become meaningless. So the hope is that things will be sorted and I think Australia has the opportunity to do really well and big decisions have to be made now. 



**Lisa Sedger:** There’s already a paper just this week published in The Lancet that profiles survivors versus those who have succumbed from the infection. And we’re starting to learn what some of those factors are. So as as clinicians can better predict who are likely to be the more seriously ill people, they can better predict who should go to hospital for treatment, and as Michael has said, who are better actually just treated at home. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Dr. Sedger, Kardia would like to know: how does this virus respond to cold or warm temperatures? Is it like the flu, which thrives in cold weather? 



**Lisa Sedger:** I have heard so many different things about this. I will be completely honest and say I’m not certain that we really know. What we know is when this high humidity viruses can exist for longer because they don’t dry out. So that envelope we talked about is less likely to be dried out. And once that’s dried out, the virus is less infective. It’s not actually infective at all if it’s disrupted that envelope. But whether it likes cold temperatures, high temperatures, we think it’s not a warm temperature virus. We think it’s more a cold temperature virus. China’s just been going through their winter. Maybe one of the reasons it’s been big in Italy is they’ve just had winter. We also think the coexistence of seasonal flu in Italy at the same time is probably one of the factors that’s made it more severe. So, yeah, look, different circumstances in different countries, different climates. It’s not just about climate, though. It’s about susceptibility of various populations. Therefore, it’s a hard question to answer (at the moment). 



**Michael Wallach:** Look, I would say in working in infectious diseases for many years, it’s a very difficult thing to predict. Remember with, it doesn’t matter which disease I was working on, everyone said it can’t transmit in dry climates. And it transmitted beautifully in the desert. And you think everything’s totally dry and it still transmits and vice versa. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Well, you’ve got MERS is another coronavirus, which is your Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, and that’s in the desert climates. So that’s why I wanted to hedge my bets on my answer. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Professor Wallach, this reader wants to know: once you’ve recovered from coronavirus, can you just go back to your normal, non-isolating life? 



**Michael Wallach:** So the current understanding, according to colleagues also in the U.S., is if you go through one infection, you’re probably rendered immune against re-infection. There have been reports of cases of people getting re-infected. But the opinion that I heard so far is that it’s probably recurrence of the same infection that probably went down in terms of clinical symptoms. But the virus remained that just came back up. It happens with the flu all the time. The question is, what should be your behaviour after you go through a bout? I guess I would still be careful, which Lisa can maybe add to, it could be that the virus will continue to mutate. Although again, I fortunately heard this morning that they’re not that worried about this virus mutating at the rate that flu does. And we’re hopeful that we will develop herd immunity. People have gone through it then will be fairly safe unless, you have some immune disorder. And then it will become part of our environment just like flu is. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And here’s a question from me. It seems like there’s two camps. There’s the people who genuinely really concerned, quite worried about the situation. We see that in the panic buying. And then there’s the other camp of people who are saying it’s all been blown up. It’s all hype. We don’t really need to worry about it. It’s too early to panic. And I just wondered, how do you reconcile those two views out there in the community? 



**Michael Wallach:** So early on in this outbreak, when I was interviewed also on the ABC and speaking to other groups, I took a very low panic view, maybe because I’ve been thinking about a pandemic for many years. And for me, it was always not a question of if, but when. I actually look at this, in a way, in a positive sense. We’re facing a pandemic that, yeah, as terrible as it is, is nothing in comparison to what could be if it’s a pandemic flu. For example, we experienced the Spanish flu in 1918, which killed somewhere between 20 to 50 million people. So the order of magnitude of mortality right now is extremely low compared to other potential pandemics. If you take China out of the equation, we’re at about 1500 people who died worldwide. That’s not to say we shouldn’t show great respect for the value of their lives. It’s mainly very elderly people with complicating illnesses and probably would have had the same effect if they were infected by flu. So my take on this whole thing is we all have to stay calm. We all have to accept the fact that this is part of nature. These viruses are out there all the time. We know them. I can detect now flu viruses in wildlife, birds that are coming into this country now, that can mutate and start affecting humans. So we have to be prepared. We have to face up to them, together in a collaborative way, in a scientific and professional way. And we could win. If we panic and react the way the market is, for example, of course, that’s that’s an improper way to react. Rather, this is part of being, of our biology. Viruses exist that can hurt us and they will always exist. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yeah. Look, I think there are a few factors that we can really learn from. So one is to work out where these viruses come from. And a lot of these RNA viruses exist in bats. They seem to be transmitted into wild animals through bat droppings. And I think one of the lessons we, the world all over, might need to learn is how we deal with the marketing and selling of wild animals that are then used for foods. That may then prevent these viruses from getting into the human population. So I think there are lessons to be learned, number one. But Michael, I would disagree with you in one sense “that it is maybe not as bad as pandemic flu”, on the other hand: we do have vaccines for flu, we do have anti-virals. And we have a whole world that has various levels of immunity to flu and different strains of flu. Whereas this virus is entering into a naive (non)-immune population. And that’s what’s so significant to start with. It may be that as our immunity at a population level increases, as a disease this will become far less significant. But the first outbreak of it in a naive, (non)-immune, (and a) “naive population” will always have the highest level of morbidity and mortality. And that’s where we have learned from other diseases like Ebola. As I mentioned, what we already know about flu, how we already control flu and the development of new and novel antiviral agents will be just as effective and important, I believe, as will the development of vaccines. So I think there’s a lot to learn to prevent this or limit, I should say, to limit these the severity of the outbreak and maybe even prevent it from happening again. As I say, if we stop trapping wild animals and eating them, we might prevent the outbreak of some of these type of RNA viruses.



 **Michael Wallach:** So I certainly agree with that. And China is now putting into law a restriction on the sale of wildlife in their markets. What I’m trying to do, and I hope we both agree, is that in proportion to, for example, influenza, even seasonal flu that killed in one year I think up to 600,000 people worldwide, I’m just trying to put things into proportion. To prevent people from panicking. To understand that, yes, this is affecting the elderly. And anyone who is elderly, suffering from heart or respiratory conditions would certainly isolate themselves. So where my wife’s parents live, where they live in a retirement village, they made a decision to close off the entire village. Nobody’s allowed in, as a means of preventing – because they’re an elderly population – people bringing in COVID-19 and infecting that area. And I certainly agree with that sort of strategy. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And John would like to know: are the death rates likely to be lower in a country like Australia with lower rates of smoking than places such as China, Iran and Indonesia? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Again, I think this is a little bit we have to watch and just wait and see. It’s very hard to predict these things. It was intriguing that some of the highest death rates in China appeared to be men as well as just the elderly. And that might be because there’s a high rate of long term smoking. So almost like an endemic lung pathology within that community that somehow exacerbated the disease. In Australia, we may find that there are different populations that are the most at risk. So we know, for example, the virus uses a receptor to get inside of cells that is a protein present on cardiac tissue. So people with known cardiac conditions may turn out to be at higher risk. And in a non-smoking type country, maybe people with existing heart conditions will turn out to be the most at risk. In America, we might find something quite different. What we might find is it’s more socio-economic. Maybe people without health insurance. Maybe people who are homeless and live on the streets will turn out to be the most affected because they have limited resources to be able to get treatment and they can’t afford treatment. So I think each country will be different. We mentioned earlier Italy has one of the highest fatality rates at the moment. That may be because they actually have a large number of people within their population that are over 65. So it might actually be not that surprising given that demographic. It might also be that they’ve had an outbreak of seasonal flu at the same time. We don’t know whether one type of virus limits the other. It’s quite possible you can get co-infections and that’s where people get the most sick. I think it’s going to pan out in different countries slightly differently. I think it’s a case of watch this space. 



**Michael Wallach:** The other thing, just on the rate of transmission. What they go according to is the people who show up to the clinic. And the results from a study done in China indicate that they may have only picked up 5% of the people that have COVID-19. So it’s about 20-fold more than actually recorded because it’s mild and very little symptoms. The other thing that’s becoming a little disconcerting for scientists is there may be two strains of the virus. And the initial outbreak, as I said, the mortality rate was very high. It could be the virus, in order to transmit, went through a mutation that aided its transmission. And I would hope that would probably occur in pandemic flu. Maybe a little less pathogenic than the original strain was. I was surprised to see at the beginning such high mortality and then how it dropped down. That’s the results also put online by the CDC. And we’re looking and following that. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yes, viral evolution is a really key topic at the moment. We think RNA viruses and the rate that they mutate is much higher than DNA viruses. And it’s really a factor of how quickly the virus mutates and how quickly a person’s immune response is able to effectively control the virus replication. So the viruses that sometimes persist longer in a community are not necessarily the most virulent. So what we might also be seeing is a population, a group within the population who get a less severe disease, maybe even asymptomatic, but that may, long term, prove to be the bigger – how could I put this? – the bigger population of viruses that exist within that community.



 **Sunanda Creagh:** And Michael would like to know: if I could shrink myself down to microscopic size and watch a virus invade a cell, what would I see? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Well, a virus is not like a bacteria. A bacteria is a entity all of its own, and it can replicate and make another copy of itself and grow on a nutrient source. A virus, however, is sometimes called a non-living entity because outside of a human cell, it can’t replicate. It just exists as an entity. A virus is essentially just a piece of DNA, which is, you know, in the nucleus of every cell. It’s what our chromosomes are made of. So it’s either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat and sometimes it’s also a lipid-based envelope outside of that, again. The virus will somehow encounter a cell. And for respiratory viruses, it’s largely by us inhaling water vapour droplets. They may contain hundreds of viruses. Those viruses then will attach or be exposed to our respiratory epithelium. If the virus can actually bind to the respiratory epithelium cell, then it might get inside. Once inside, it may or may not have the capacity to actually undergo replication, but it has to uncoat from that protein shell. Then the nucleic acid, the DNA or RNA has to make another copy of itself. Then all the genes that are in the virus have to get expressed as proteins. They then reassemble into a new viral particle and then the virus will get out of the cell. Sometimes it [lyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (breaks) the cell, sometimes it will just buds out from the cell and leave the cell intact. And that’s what a virus is. That’s why we, some people call them living or non-living because they can only replicate in inside a cell, a host cell.



 **Michael Wallach:** And it’s not like viruses have a will. So if they want to do this, it’s just part of evolution. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yes, I’m never a favour of the argument you sometimes see people say “it’s warfare, it’s the virus vs. immune system!” But there’s no will involved, it’s just capacity of life to replicate itself. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Deidre writes in to say, I heard on the radio today that half the population is likely to get this. And with, say, a 1% death rate, the body count will add up. And I wondered what you thought of that. 



**Michael Wallach:** So there was an announcement actually by Angela Merkel preparing Germany for 70% of the population being infected. Lisa may say the number is lower, I don’t know, until we build up herd immunity. The question of the mortality rate, as I alluded to before, I think based on what again, CDC and WHO are writing, is probably overestimated. Some estimate the mortality rate as being much lower. That’s not to say… every death is a family and has to be looked at and be concerned about. So again, I think and would like to hope that as we develop new vaccines, as we develop drugs, as we develop approaches to quarantine people, test them, keep them at home, isolate them, we’ll get the mortality rate under control. And I’m going to express an optimistic view. This world has amazing capabilities of doing amazing science. And if we apply it and work together, I think we can control this problem. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yes, absolutely. I would endorse that. And I’d say that the mortality rates at the moment simply reflect who is being tested. And it’s primarily people who are turning up with symptoms. But we’re now beginning to appreciate that there is a large number of people who could be quite asymptomatic, who are never tested. This virus will certainly have infected many more people than will be tested. And if we did have surveillance of every single person being tested, then there’s two questions here: Are you testing for the presence of the virus? If they’ve had virtually no symptoms and not a big illness, you might not find the virus. But if we test for the presence of an immune response to the virus, we would truly know how many people have been infected. And then we could get a true estimate or at least a much closer estimate of what the mortality rate really is. So at the moment, there’s hyperbole.



 **Sunanda Creagh:** And Catherine asks, what is the likelihood of transmission through using a public swimming pool? 



**Lisa Sedger:** I would think quite small because a) the virus would be quite diluted in a swimming pool. Secondly, swimming pools are all treated with chlorine, for example, and chlorine is a very effective anti-viral agent. You’d have to drink a lot of swimming pool water to get the virus. 



**Michael Wallach:** I agree with that. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** Candy would like to know: there are conflicting symptoms lists circulating on Facebook. One says it starts with a dry cough and if your nose is running, it is not COVID-19, which I suspect is incorrect. Can we please have an accurate list? 



**Michael Wallach:** So, again, the major symptoms are, in fact, the cough and shortness of breath and fever. But, it’s not to say it’s not possible that you’ll have also upper respiratory effects. The virus goes into the lung and attaches to the alveolar cells or to the cells that make up our air sacs and that help our breathing. And it has to get there to really cause this disease. So if there’s upper respiratory involvement, which includes sneezing and runny nose, et cetera, it’s probably not the main effect of the virus. Again, I would say if you see that somebody is sneezing and wheezing and and that’s it, it’s probably an allergy, but it does frighten people. I was on the train this morning, and I know if I, God forbid, sneezed the whole train would empty out pretty quickly. 



**Lisa Sedger:** You know, we’re just coming into winter. And actually, it’s a really good question because at the moment, what’s building is a sense of fear. But we must keep in perspective that there will also still be the normal seasonal cases of flu. So just because somebody sneezes or has a sore throat does not mean that they’ve got COVID-19. And we need to make sure, I think it’s really important that we don’t stigmatise people who have symptoms because it may not even be COVID. And we’re all at risk from any respiratory tract infections and already have been for years. That’s not a new thing. We just need to keep things in perspective. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** A question from Karen: can you catch it twice? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Normally, I would have said no, because we imagine that there’s a good immune response that will then provide you protection from re-infection. That’s what our immune system does. But this is a new virus. We don’t yet fully understand how our immune system clears it. We don’t know whether virus can remain for a longer period of time. I would would say, though, that there are only a few cases of people who have been treated, appear to have recovered, they’ve gone home, they’ve then had another relapse. There’s only a very few number of cases that have been like that. So for all intents and purposes, I don’t think that’s something we should fear and it’s not something we’ve seen with the previous SARS outbreak in 2003. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And Tim would like to know: how will quarantine work in a family? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yeah, it’s interesting, isn’t it? We think of quarantine as being away from work or away from public places. But really, if you have been infected, then the people in your family are as at risk as your work colleagues would be at work. Again, I think it’s about just common sense. Don’t share food utensils, wash your hands, don’t keep touching your face and your mouth and your nose. Get rid of tissues in a nice sort of clean manner. It’s about minimising transmission. 



**Michael Wallach:** Let me just add to that, that all the data indicates that children likely will only get very mild symptoms, if at all. So if you’re a family member and you’re worried about your children, this is one time that you can be happy about this. All the results so far indicate that children aged zero to nine, there’s not been a single death. 



**Lisa Sedger:** Whereas what we do know is the elderly appear to be more susceptible to a more severe disease. So that’s where if I’m sick, it’s better not to go and visit my grandparents or something like that. That’s where quarantine within the family works in a practical sense. 



**Sunanda Creagh:** And just to finish up, is there anything else that you’d like to add? 



**Lisa Sedger:** Yeah, I think I’d just want to finish with a really positive note. I mean, we live in an amazing era of medical research and science. Within within a very, very short period of time, parts of the virus had been sequenced. We now track the virus in its entire sequence. We know, we have clinical trials for the drugs. We have people working on vaccines. We have epidemiologists better understanding the disease susceptibility within a population. I mean, we learn a lot from other existing outbreaks of infectious diseases. And I remain positive that, you know, the medical and scientific community working together will be able to solve this. I’m quite confident that there’s a really strong response. That’s not to diminish that people have died and it’s been tragic. But we live in an era where we’re exposed to infectious agents and we are getting better and better at controlling most of those infections. 



**Michael Wallach:** So I’ll just add and put in a plug for a program I’m very much involved with called Spark working with people at Stanford. We established a program for exactly this time, when there’s sudden outbreaks. And the program now involves 23 countries and around 70 institutions, all working together for outbreaks of Zika, Ebola and now coronavirus. It gives me great hope that, apart from what you said, we’re now working together collaboratively like never before. We’re putting our egos outside and we’re saying we have social responsibility to do better. Certainly, in the case of a pandemic. And we’re doing it. And we’re very proud to be able to say we have 15 projects going on now collaboratively that we just formed over the past two weeks, together with our colleagues all over the world. I also believe in a very bright future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming was supposed to inject thermal energy into the atmosphere, and thus spawn one super cyclone after another.  Yet observations refuse to cooperate with the alarmist hypothesis.
At Twitter Colorado State University research scientist Philip Klotzbach reports that 2017 global cyclone energy “remains at record low levels“:

Earlier on June 13 Klotzbach tweeted the following chart showing how this year has been running thus far:

Despite all the warnings that a warming globe would lead to harsher and wilder hurricane seasons, data show that the the opposite is more the case.
In fact the especially harsh June hurricanes occurred when CO2 were at rock bottom levels of 280 ppm, like back 131 years ago, in 1886. Klotzbach writes: “In 1886, 3 June hurricanes made U.S. landfall“. He added:
No other Atlantic season on record has had more than one June U.S. hurricane landfall.”
The following chart shows the 1886 hurricane season:

And to show that things were much worse during the cooler, low CO2 days of the past, Klotzbach tweeted on June 12 the following chart:

CSU atmospheric researcher Klotzbach: “14 Cat. 4-5 hurricanes made U.S. landfall from 1926-1969 (44 years). Only 3 Cat. 4-5 hurricanes have made U.S. landfall since (47 years).”
That 1926 – 1969 period was close to 5 times more active with powerful hurricane strikes than the recent 1970 – 2016 period.
At his Weekend Summary at Weatherbell, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi shows us the wild hurricane activity back in the 1950s.

Bastardi: “Can you imagine if this happened again, the media would be going nuts.” Cropped from Weatherbell Weekend Summary. 
But fortunately we are far from that level of activity – at least for now.
Surprisingly alarmist scientists refuse to bring up the real probability that a warmer world perhaps means milder cyclone activity, as many statistical trends indicate. Of course if the exact opposite were occurring, or even just repeating, scientists would be claiming that there’s unmistakable proof that rising global temperatures cause harsher hurricane activity.
The fact they are are not tells us that the global warming is not about science, but all about politics.

"**HSBC and Standard Chartered have given their backing to China's new security laws for Hong Kong.**
Both banks made statements saying the proposed law can help maintain long-term stability in the troubled city.
On Wednesday, HSBC's Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Wong signed a petition backing the law which has been widely criticised.
But this backing comes as Japanese bank Nomura was reported to be ""seriously"" examining its presence in Hong Kong.
Nomura later clarified reports to say that its Hong Kong and China operations were not under review.
It is unusual for a bank to enter into political debate, particularly one as controversial as China's new security laws which many feel could mark the end of Hong Kong's unique freedoms.
HSBC's statement noted that the Hong Kong Association of Banks had already issued a statement saying the law would contribute to a stable business environment.
Although it is Europe's largest bank, HSBC has a strong presence in Asia, particularly Hong Kong.
HSBC ""respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong's social order,"" it said in a post on social media in China.
The bank's full name is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and it has its origins in the former British colony. While HSBC moved its headquarters to London in 1993, Hong Kong is still its biggest market.
Standard Chartered also has a strong presence in Asia. ""We believe the national security law can help maintain the long-term economic and social stability of Hong Kong,"" it said in a statement.
It added that ""the 'one country, two systems' principle is core to the future success of Hong Kong and has always been the bedrock of the business community's confidence"".
Meanwhile, Japanese investment bank Nomura said it was reviewing the scale of its operations in Hong Kong.
The bank's chief executive, Kentaro Okuda, said that while Hong Kong remained its most critical Asian hub outside Japan, the situation now was ""not the same as it used to be"" in an interview with the FT.
While the details are still being fleshed out, the new security laws would make criminal any act of:
Hong Kong residents are concerned this will affect free speech and their right to protest. In China this would be seen as subversion. People are also worried about suggestions that China could set up its own institutions in Hong Kong responsible for security.
""The new national security law will deal the most severe blow to the rights of people in Hong Kong since the territory's transfer to China in 1997,"" according to Human Rights Watch.
HSBC had been previously caught up in Hong Kong's anti-government protests, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march in January.
The bank is also facing its own challenges from the coronavirus pandemic with the prospect of thousands of job losses and a significant drop in earnings.
HSBC didn't respond to a request from the BBC for further comments about the social media post."
"You have just been elected leader of the Liberal Democrats. Congratulations! Allow me to be the first to say: we always knew it would be you. Like millions of other little children all over the world with posters of Paddy Ashdown above their beds, you had a dream: to one day lead our boys in yellow. But unlike them, your dream came true. Now, you’ll have noticed that people are very angry at the moment, about all kinds of different things: the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, racism, climate breakdown, the economy, the Tories, the Labour party. And we want all of those people to vote for your friends and mine, the Lib Dems, at the next general election. So what we need is a statement that implies we’re like, good, but in the most general possible way. OK, hold on, now I think you might love this. What about: “I am listening”? It’s good, isn’t it? Hoof the ball right back into the public’s court. Great stuff. OK, here’s two free drink tokens – enjoy the party, champ.  I’m being a little unfair to Ed Davey here, and in any case, dunking on the Lib Dems is so easy it’s almost distasteful. His speech on winning the leadership contest last week was only the latest in a long line of politicians’ statements promising that their biggest priority was to listen to the electorate. William Hague made needing to listen the centrepiece of his 1998 party conference speech, and Tony Blair did the same at his party conference in 2000. Listening has felt especially ubiquitous this year. Rory Stewart’s vampiric London mayoral campaign involved asking people to invite him across their thresholds for a chat and a sleepover, an idea that, in the era of social distancing, seems about as contemporary as a sprightly quadrille. Taking listening-as-home-invasion into the pandemic age, Keir Starmer has spent the summer doing Zoom-based listening tours of the country. And in the US a few weeks ago, Joe Biden assured young voters that he would “hear their voices”, too. It’s not just politicians either. In the wake of George Floyd’s death, brands and institutions rushed to social media to confirm that they too were listening. Sweaty Betty is listening. The University of Hull is listening. PG Tips, with an upturned teacup pressed against your bedroom wall, is listening. Why all this emphasis on listening? More often than not, it’s little more than an easy thing to say when you don’t want to alienate voters – or customers – by falling down hard on one side of an issue. Listening does form a central part of what MPs do locally in their constituencies through their regular surgeries, a term which makes the process sound about as appealing as getting your knee reset by Michael Fabricant. Talking about listening to an entire population, however, is all too often an empty platitude or performance. And no wonder politicians don’t want to actually listen to public grievances when so much of what they would hear is unfiltered rage. Boris Johnson’s “People’s PMQs” stunt has seen him receive questions from the public such as “When will you resign for your mishandling of the pandemic?” and the ever-popular “How do you sleep at night?”  Political listening is always, in the end, a selective process. Listening to whom? Whomever’s opinion already aligns best with the party’s values? Both Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party claimed to be about listening to people. And in any case, not all concerns are created equal. Tinfoil milliners concerned about whether China is beaming coronavirus into their homes via cellular data waves, or your local crank who wants to make it punishable by law not to thank the bus driver are, I would argue, less worthy of airtime than people concerned about the impacts of systemic racism. A popular belief of the political centre in the UK is that the act of listening in and of itself can somehow bring wildly diverging opinion on contentious issues to an imagined point of agreement or compromise. Extinction Rebellion has attracted criticism for its emphasis on setting up a citizens’ assembly  to discuss what should be done to tackle the climate crisis. It’s a noble enough idea, but as they often emphasise, time is running out. We don’t need more conversation, we need widespread divestment from fossil fuels. When brands promise they are listening on Black Lives Matter, it implies that what is required is more testimony rather than more action. And Starmer’s inexhaustible appetite for holding inquiries is a slightly different but related urge – sure, we can take action on things, but only after we spend a great deal of time yakking about it. In Leah Bassel’s book The Politics of Listening, she writes: “Politics means naming the social forces that deflect attention from particular voices, and is necessarily adversarial as well as active and creative.” It is never going to be enough just to listen; one has to take action against the forces that mean certain voices are unheard in the first place. Listening to varied opinion is an important part of a healthy political climate. But without being followed by meaningful action, it’s all talk. • Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist based in London"

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate models overstate global precipitation by almost a half
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited By P Gosselin)
Slowly people are realizing that not everything in the climate modeling world is as rosy as once claimed for years. It’s bit like the Tour de France, where racers were once celebrated as heroes, but later the doping reality came to light. Are we on the verge of the same realization in the field of climate modelling?
Recently we saw a worthwhile editorial in Nature, 3 May 2017, where the global warming hiatus and communication errors were admitted on both sides:
Increased scrutiny of climate-change models should be welcomed
The apparent slowdown in global warming has provided a spur for better understanding of the underlying processes. […] Some background: the El Niño weather event in 1997 and 1998 belched a great bolus of heat from the ocean into the atmosphere, a release that was entirely consistent with expectations — as was the heady spike in global mean surface temperature that followed. From the top of the Himalayas, the rest of Earth is downhill. And, in a similar way, the 1998 peak in temperature offered an easily visualized time that climate sceptics could cherry-pick as a starting point for a ‘hiatus’, ‘pause’ or ‘slowdown’ in climate change. It’s true (of course) that the next few years saw a reduced rate of warming, or maybe even a slight cooling. And it’s also true that, soon after, some analyses showed that these observations were beginning to diverge from the suite of projections made by climate models. A few responses emerged. First: yawn — “This is nothing more than the sort of normal variability one should expect in the climate system, and models should not be expected to predict any specific dip or peak.” Second: hysteria — “Climate scientists have no idea what controls the climate system.” Third: interesting  — “Let’s figure this out.” Happily, most of the climate-science community adopted the third option. The result was a flood of publications on the topic, and the only half-joking suggestion that Nature’s publisher should launch a new journal called Nature Hiatus.
Continue reading in Nature.
Already in March 2016 Nature was looking at the topic:
Where climate models fall short
Climate models tend to overestimate the extent to which climate change contributes to weather events such as extreme heat and rain. Omar Bellprat and Francisco Doblas-Reyes at the Catalan Institute of Climate Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, used an idealized statistical model to compare the frequency of weather extremes in simulations with and without climate warming. Extreme events seemed to be more closely linked to climate change when the model was forced to run at low levels of reliability than when the model error was kept to a minimum. To account for models’ biased representation of climate variability, studies should rely on calibrated model ensembles, which are commonly used by weather forecasters, the authors suggest.”
There was also welcome realism in a press release from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in December 10, 2015. Climate models systematically overstated the increase in precipitation by 40%:
Climate models overestimate rainfall increases
Lawrence Livermore researchers and collaborators have found that most climate models overestimate the increase in global precipitation due to climate change. Specifically, the team looked at 25 models and found they underestimate the increase in absorption of sunlight by water vapor as the atmosphere becomes moister, and therefore overestimate increases in global precipitation. The team found global precipitation increase per degree of global warming at the end of the 21st century may be about 40 percent smaller than what the models, on average, currently predict. The research appears in the Dec. 10 edition of the journal Nature.
Evaluation of model-predicted global precipitation change with actual precipitation observations is difficult due to uncertainties arising from many sources, including insufficient spatial and historical data coverage. As an alternative approach, the team, made up of LLNL scientist Mark Zelinka and colleagues from the University of California, Los Angeles, including lead author Anthony DeAngelis, evaluated model-simulated global precipitation change through consideration of the physical processes that govern it.

The team found that the increase in global precipitation simulated by models is strongly controlled by how much additional sunlight is absorbed by water vapor as the planet warms: Models in which more sunlight is absorbed by water vapor tend to have smaller increases in precipitation. They demonstrated that model-to-model differences in increased absorption of sunlight were not controlled by how much their humidity increased, but by how much additional sunlight was trapped in the atmosphere for a given increase in humidity. Conveniently, this quantity can be measured from space, allowing the team to assess how well the models capture the physics controlling changes in global precipitation.
“This comparison with observations allowed us to see quite clearly that most models underestimate the increased absorption of sunlight as water vapor increases,” Zelinka said. “Because this acts as such a strong lever on global precipitation changes, the models are likely overestimating the increase in global precipitation with global warming.”

There was also model failure in the simulation of wildlife space. The animals of the last ice age stubbornly resisted the requirements of the computer simulation and instead showed an expansion that was completely unexpected. Press release by the University of Oregon from November 2014:
Fossils cast doubt on climate-change projections on habitats
Mammals didn’t play by the rules of modeling on where they migrated to survive last ice age, says UO researcher
Leave it to long-dead short-tailed shrew and flying squirrels to outfox climate-modelers trying to predict future habitats. Evidence from the fossil record shows that gluttonous insect-eating shrew didn’t live where a species distribution technique drawn by biologists put it 20,000 years ago to survive the reach of glaciers, says University of Oregon geologist Edward B. Davis. The shrew is not alone. According to a new study by Davis and colleagues, fossil records of five ancient mammalian species that survived North America’s last glacial period point to weaknesses in the use of ecological niche models and hindcasting to predict future animal and plant habitats. As a result, Davis says, the modeling needs to be fine-tuned for complexities that might be harvested from fossils.
Ecological niches use modern habitat distributions and climate; hindcasting adds predictive power by adding major past climate shifts into the models. That modeling combination — as seen in a 2007 study led by Eric Waltari, then of the American Museum of Natural History in New York — had the short-tailed shrew surviving the last ice age in mostly Texas and the Deep South. Conclusions drawn in other studies, Davis noted in the new study, also are biased toward southern locations for ice-age surviving mammals of the Pleistocene Epoch. Short-tailed shrew, according to fossil records, did not live in the predicted ranges. Instead they lived across north central and northeast United States, closer to the glaciers and where they are widely found today.
“It’s almost as though it is living in all of the places that the model says it shouldn’t be living in and not in any of the places that the model says it should be living in,” said Davis, who also is manager of the paleontological collection at the UO Museum of Natural and Cultural History. “This suggests to me that whatever the model is keying on is not actually important to the shrew.” Nor to the American marten (Martes americana), two species of flying squirrels and the Gapper’s red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi), all of which lived mostly outside of predicted ranges, according to the fossil record. Northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern (Glaucomys volans) flying squirrels, the Davis study found, shared a compressed geographic region. It may be, Davis said, that some species tolerate competition under harsh conditions but separate when abundant resources are available.
Davis noted that an important but under-cited 2010 paper on rodents by Robert Guralnick of the University of Colorado and Peter B. Pearman of the Swiss Federal Research Institute also showed problems with hindcast projections. Those for lowland rodents in the last ice age did not hold up, but those for a higher elevation species did. “Our findings say that we need to pay more attention to the potential problems we have with some of our modern methods, and the way that we can improve our understanding of how species interact with the environment,” said Davis, who added that his study was inspired by Waltari’s. “The way to improve our forecasting is to include data from the fossil record. It can give us more information about the environments that species have lived in and could live in.” The findings appear in the November issue of the journal Ecography. In a special section of the journal, the Davis paper is packaged with four papers on research initially presented in a symposium on conservation paleobiogeography in 2013 at a biennial meeting of the International Biography Society. The Davis paper is co-authored by Jenny L. McGuire, now at Georgia Tech University, and former UO doctoral student John D. Orcutt, who is now at Cornell College in Iowa.”

What do you know? Pollution levels are down, the sky can be seen over China and the canals in Venice are cleaner than ever in living memory. And what brought this about? The coronavirus pandemic. A real emergency, where thousands have already lost their lives, forced us to change our behaviour overnight. The environmental improvements are a welcome consequence.



In recent years the moral posturers, lead by our Prime Minister, Megan and Harrry and a cast of thousands (from the ‘do as I say not what I do’ brigade) have preached to us how we should live our lives whilst jetting off to their next summit or holiday at another exotic location. And the dangerous, life-threatening carbon emissions continued to rise!



Overnight this has all changed. Forced to close borders and observe physical distancing to contain a deadly virus, **President Trump** has announced the G7 will be held by video conference. A perfectly practical alternative which can achieve the same outcomes without the huge bills for dirty carbon-emitting jets, expensive hotels, sumptuous meals and thousands of hangers-on. 



Drastic times call for drastic measures.



The world’s leaders have been forced to use a technological alternative, because **this is a REAL EMERGENCY, not a fake one** dreamed up by the progressives for their own ends. 



My question is (and has always been) **if manmade climate change is a ‘thing’, why have world leaders and companies not been extensively using video conferencing since its emergence to be economical, promote environmental sustainability and… save the world?**



The answer is simple. There is no climate emergency; the world is NOT coming to an end (but could definitely do with some tweaks around the edges to make it more sustainable). If it were, drastic action would have been taken by our leaders by now. 



Video conferencing (not jet travel to far-flung destinations) would be _de rigueur_ for all, most of the time. Perhaps a system similar to ‘carless days’, like we had in 1979 during the global fuel crisis, would have been enforced in Auckland to ease congestion and cut emissions because (like our current real emergency) the alternative would be too terrible to contemplate.



The students’ climate change protests, where they beat their chests and bemoan lack of action, led by ‘rising star’ Luke (the Green’s candidate for Mt Albert), get them publicity on the evening news and a day off school. But then it’s back to their old routines, selfishly ignoring the environmental consequences of their own actions. A bunch of moral posturers, like their grown-up ideologue mates.



The Covid-19 Pandemic is scary and life-changing. IT IS REAL. We must change or face fatal consequences. Not just virtue signal and then return to our thoughtless, self-absorbed ways.



The question is: will we like the new improved world, which we have unintentionally created through a real crisis, enough to take real transformative action (not the pretend stuff Ardern and her cohorts preach) after the pandemic has calmed down and life returns to normal? 



I can’t think of any drawbacks. Apart from the reduction of photo-ops of Ardern pretending to save the planet. That would be a shame.

According to NASA’s Spaceweather.com, a G1-class geomagnetic storm is ringing Earth’s poles on Sept. 29th as a high-speed (600+ km/s) stream of solar wind continues to buffet our planet’s magnetic field. While this particular storm isn’t expected to do more than produce spectacular Auroras and perhaps cause some minor power grid fluctuations, knowing what impacts a stronger solar storm could have is very beneficial to society. A new solar impact model that NOAA will implement on Saturday should help determine what areas of Earth would be most affected.
From the University of Michigan and Rice University
Solar storms: Regional forecasts set to begin
ANN ARBOR—For the first time beginning next month, forecasts of the regional effects of solar storms will help protect the power grid and communications satellites, thanks to a new tool developed by researchers at the University of Michigan and Rice University.
Solar storms are torrents of charged particles and electromagnetic fields from the sun that rattle the planet’s magnetic field. Major disturbances can send harmful current into power lines, hampering operations and putting expensive transformers at risk. They can also damage satellites.

Today, scientists know when a storm is headed toward us, but it’s impossible to predict where on Earth it will hit hardest. So utility companies and satellite operators can’t always limit damage to their systems by shutting off key components.
That will change Oct. 1, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center begins using a new geospace forecast model that can give unique data for each 350-square-mile plot of Earth, and up to 45 minutes before a solar storm hits.
“This is the first time that utility companies will have a regional forecast of space weather effects with any lead time,” said Dan Welling, assistant research scientist in the U-M Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering and one of the model’s developers. “Compared to atmospheric weather forecasting, this sounds like a trivial step, but in terms of space weather, it’s a giant leap.”

Humans haven’t experienced a catastrophic solar storm since putting up the grid and launching satellites. The “Carrington event” in September 1859 caused significant disruption, but only telegraph wires were around. They continued banging out and receiving messages even after their power supplies were disconnected, and some even set the paper on fire.
If a similar event happened today, “it would really be a disaster much worse than a major hurricane,” said Gabor Toth, research professor in the U-M Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering and one of the model’s developers.
Power outages could last months or more because it could take that long to replace any damaged electrical transformers. That’s a long time in societies that depend on electricity for essentials like food, heat, water and communication.
“The Geospace model will help us provide better information to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and through them, to the grid operators whose decisions affect over 334 million people in the U.S. and Canada,” said Howard Singer, chief scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. “Our forecasts will be used to provide, for the first time, the actionable regional information needed to reduce the risk from extreme space weather.”
Unlike most present-day models, the new one is not based on statistics.
“This is the first high-performance physics-based geospace model that can run faster than real time,” said Tamas Gombosi, the Konstantin I. Gringauz Distinguished University Professor of Space Science and the Rollin M. Gerstacker Professor of Engineering at U-M.
It pulls together three components that researchers worked for a quarter century to develop and meld: a “magnetohydrodynamic” model that simulates effects on the Earth from electric and magnetic fields, an ionosphere model that represents aspects of the top layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, and a “ring current” model that gives insights into a region of hot particles that encircles the planet. Scientists at U-M developed the first two and at Rice, the ring current model.
“The ring current, located in the inner magnetosphere, is connected to both the ionosphere and the outer magnetosphere and its inclusion was crucial to making realistic predictions with the model,” said Stanislav Sazykin, associate research professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice. “We were able to construct a coupled model that is robust and stable.”
Scientists have estimated an up to 12 percent chance that Earth could be hit with an extreme solar storm in the next decade. In 2012, a Carrington-scale ejection crossed Earth’s orbit and missed us by a week. Since that time, important measures have been taken. In June 2014, the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission began requiring utilities to prepare for solar storms. And in 2015, the White House released a Space Weather Action Plan.
Extreme space weather can happen at any time, but historically the strongest storms tend to hit during the declining phase of the sun’s 22-year activity cycle.
“The largest storms occur after solar maximum, so we are in the most dangerous period right now,” Gombosi said.
Good timing for the new model.

A new Cato national survey finds that self‐​censorship is on the rise in the United States. Nearly two-thirds—62%—of Americans say the political climate these days prevents them from saying things they believe because others might find them offensive. The share of Americans who self‐​censor has risen several points since 2017 when 58% of Americans agreed with this statement.



These fears cross partisan lines. Majorities of Democrats (52%), independents (59%) and Republicans (77%) all agree they have political opinions they are afraid to share.



twitter #CatoPolls



Strong liberals stand out, however, as the only political group who feel they can express themselves. Nearly 6 in 10 (58%) of staunch liberals feel they can say what they believe. However, centrist liberals feel differently. A slim majority (52%) of liberals feel they have to self‐​censor, as do 64% of moderates, and 77% of conservatives. This demonstrates that political expression is an issue that divides the Democratic coalition between centrist Democrats and their left flank.



What’s changed? In 2017 most centrist liberals felt confident (54%) they could express their views. However today, slightly less than half (48%) feel the same. The share who feel they cannot be open increased 7 points from 45% in 2017 to 52% today. In fact, there have been shifts across the board, where more people among all political groups feel they are walking on eggshells.



Although strong liberals are the only group who feel they can say what they believe, the share who feel pressured to self‐​censor rose 12 points from 30% in 2017 to 42% in 2020. The share of moderates who self‐​censor increased 7 points from 57% to 64%, and the share of conservatives rose 70% to 77%, also a 7‐​point increase. Strong conservatives are the only group with little change. They are about as likely now (77%) to say they hold back their views as in 2017 (76%).



Self‐​censorship is widespread across demographic groups as well. Nearly two‐​thirds of Latino Americans (65%) and White Americans (64%) and nearly half of African Americans (49%) have political views they are afraid to share. Majorities of men (65%) and women (59%), people with incomes over $100,000 (60%) and people with incomes less than $20,000 (58%), people under 35 (55%) and over 65 (66%), religious (71%) and non‐​religious (56%) all agree that the political climate prevents them from expressing their true beliefs.



The survey found that many Americans think a person’s private political donations should impact their employment. Nearly a quarter (22%) of Americans would support firing a business executive who personally donates to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s campaign. Even more, 31% support firing a business executive who donates to Donald Trump’s re‐​election campaign.



Support rises among political subgroups. Support increases to 50% of strong liberals who support firing executives who personally donate to Trump. And more than a third (36%) of strong conservatives support firing an executive for donating to Biden’s presidential campaign.



Young Americans are also more likely than older Americans to support punishing people at work for personal donations to Trump. Forty‐​four percent (44%) of Americans under 30 support firing executives if they donate to Trump. This share declines to 22% among those over 55 years old—a 20‐​point difference. An age gap also exists for Biden donors, but is less pronounced. Twenty‐​seven percent (27%) of Americans under 30 support firing executives who donate to Biden compared to 20% of those over 55—a 7‐​point difference.



Nearly a third (32%) of employed Americans say they personally are worried about missing out on career opportunities or losing their job if their political opinions became known. These results are particularly notable given that most personal campaign contributions to political candidates are public knowledge and can easily be found online.



And it’s not just one side of the political spectrum: 31% of liberals, 30% of moderates and 34% of conservatives are worried their political views could get them fired or harm their career trajectory. This suggests that it’s not necessarily just one particular set of views that has moved outside of acceptable public discourse. Instead these results are more consistent with a “walking on eggshells” thesis that people increasingly fear a wide range of political views could offend others or could negatively impact themselves.



These concerns are also cross‐​partisan, although more Republicans are worried: 28% of Democrats, 31% of independents, and 38% of Republicans are worried about how their political opinions could impact their career trajectories.



Americans with diverse backgrounds share this concern that their employment could be adversely affected if their political views were discovered: 38% of Hispanic Americans, 22% of African Americans, 31% of White Americans, 35% of men, 27% of women, 36% of households earning less than $20,000 a year, and 33% of households earning more than $100,000 a year agree.



Some are more worried about losing their jobs or missing out on job opportunities because of political views. Those with the highest levels of education are most concerned. Almost half (44%) of Americans with post‐​graduate degrees say they are worried their careers could be harmed if others discovered their political opinions, compared to 34% of college graduates, 28% of those with some college experience, and 25% of high school graduates



But this educational divide appears largely driven by partisanship. Democrats with graduate degrees (25%) are about as likely as high school graduates (23%) to be worried their political views could harm their employment. However, a major shift occurs among Republicans who attend college and graduate school. About a quarter of Republicans with high school degrees (27%) or some college (26%) worry their political opinions could harm them at work—but this number increases to 40% among Republican college graduates and 60% of those with post‐​graduate degrees. A similar trend is observed among independents. The share of independents who have these concerns increases from 18% among high school graduates, to 35% among those with some college, 41% of college graduates, and 49% of post‐​graduates.



Younger people are also more concerned than older people, irrespective of political viewpoint. Examining all Americans under 65, 37% of those under 30 are worried their political opinions could harm their career trajectories, compared to 30% of 30–54 year‐​olds and 24% of 55–64 year‐​olds. But the age gap is more striking taking into account political views. A slim majority (51%) of Republicans under 30 fear their views could harm their career prospects compared to 39% of 30–44 year‐​olds, 34% of 45–54 year‐​olds, and 28% of 55–64 year‐​old Republicans. Democrats reflect a similar but less pronounced pattern. A third (33%) of Democrats under 30 worry they have views that could harm their current and future jobs, compared to 27% of 30–54 year‐​olds, and 19% of 55–64 year‐​old Democrats.



These data suggest that a significant minority of Americans from all political persuasions and backgrounds—particularly younger people who have spent more time in America’s universities—are most likely to hide their views for fear of financial penalty.



A particularly surprising finding was that Americans who have these concerns are somewhat more likely to support the firing of Biden or Trump donors. A third (33%) among those who worry that their political views could harm their employment supported firing either Biden or Trump donors, compared to 24% of those who were not worried about their views impacting their jobs. This suggests that those who fear reprisal or economic penalty for their political views are not entirely distinct from those who seek the same for others.



Taking these results together indicates that a significant majority of Americans with diverse political views and backgrounds self‐​censor their political opinions. This large number from across demographic groups suggests withheld opinions may not simply be radical or fringe perspectives in the process of being socially marginalized. Instead many of these opinions may be shared by a large number of people. Opinions so widely shared are likely shaping how people think about salient policy issues and ultimately impacting how they vote. But if people feel they cannot discuss these important policy matters, such views will not have an opportunity to be scrutinized, understood, or reformed.

Why does the Neo‐​Malthusians’ dystopian worldview — that human and environmental well‐​being will suffer with increases in population, affluence and technological change — fail the reality check? Why has human well‐​being improved in the Age of Industrialization despite order‐​of‐​magnitude increases in the consumption of materials, fossil fuel energy and chemicals?   
  
  
I offer some reasons in the last of a series of posts (1, 2, 3, 4) at MasterResource.   
  
  
I note that although population, affluence and technology can create some problems for humanity and the planet, they are also the agents for solving those problems. In particular, human capital and greater affluence have helped the development and adoption of new and improved technologies, which empirical data show have reduced risks faster than the new risks that may have been created — hence the continual improvement in human well‐​being in the era of modern economic growth.   
  
  
A corollary to this is that projections of future impacts spanning a few decades, but that do not account for technological change as a function of time and affluence, more likely than not will overestimate impacts, perhaps by orders of magnitude. In fact, this is one reason why many estimates of the future impacts of climate change are suspect, because most do not account for changes in adaptive capacity either due to secular technological change or increases in economic development.   
  
  
Yogi Berra is supposed to have said, “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.” Most analysts recognize this. They know that just because one can explain and hindcast the past, it does not guarantee that one can forecast the future. Neo‐​Malthusians, by contrast, cannot hindcast the past but are confident they can forecast the future.   
  
  
Finally, had the solutions that Neo‐​Malthusians espouse been put into effect a couple of centuries ago, most of us alive today would be dead and those who were not would be living poorer, shorter, and unhealthier lives, constantly subject to the vagaries of nature, surviving from harvest to harvest, spending more of our time in darkness because lighting would be a luxury, and spending more of our days in the drudgery of menial tasks because, under their skewed application of the precautionary principle (see here, here and here), fossil fuel consumption would be severely curtailed, if not banned.   
  
  
Nor would the rest of nature necessarily be better off. First, lower reliance on fossil fuels would mean greater demand for fuelwood, and the forests would be denuded. Second, less fossil fuels also means less fertilizer and pesticides and, therefore, lower agricultural productivity. To compensate for lost productivity, more habitat would need to be converted to agricultural uses. But habitat conversion (including deforestation) — not climate change — is already the greatest threat to biodiversity!

"Bristol will be the first British city to “go Dutch” after the city council gave the green light to building a European-style cycle network that would not be shared with road traffic. The city’s plans for a strategic cycle network chime with the Prime Minister’s announcement this summer of a cycleway to parallel the proposed High Speed 2 line linking London and the North, and a pot of £148m for England’s major cities to improve and “cycle proof” their transport infrastructure. After being concerned with “smoothing the flow” of road traffic, London’s Mayor is also now promoting a vision which includes turning many London boroughs into cycle-friendly “mini-Hollands”. It’s encouraging to see the ambition to improve matters for cyclists reaching ever higher levels of political influence. It is excellent that there seems now to be more thought to investing strategically in cycling, and a greater willingness to invest the sums of money needed. The rhetoric is in place and funding is in the pipeline, but the jury is still out on what practical steps are needed to create attractive and comfortable conditions for large numbers of urban cyclists. Where is the detail, what is the model? Do we want to go with Dutch Pancakes, or Danish Pastries, or stick with our rather stirred up English pudding? World-renowned for their cycling, the emphasis in The Netherlands is on cycle routes that are entirely separate from motor traffic. This traffic segregation has become the main focus of discussion about cycling provision, and is commonly discussed in the context of roundabout design in The Netherlands. Arguably the more important aspect is the nature of comprehensive cycle networks: routes tend to be more direct, remove difficult barriers to movement, and above all are designed so that it is quicker and easier to bike than drive. These are often referred to as filtered permeability networks, a phrase coined by Steve Melia from the University of the West of England. The Danes on the other hand (forgive the sweeping generalisations) are more prepared to mix cycle and motor traffic. For example at traffic light-controlled junctions, cycle users typically leave a kerb-separated cycle lane to join other road traffic on the main carriageway, progress through the junction, before returning to the separate cycleway. Northern Europeans also have different highway code rules for road users. For example, helpful time saving protocols at traffic lights where pedestrians and turning traffic can move at the same time, with traffic giving way to pedestrians. These differences in the highway code create a different culture of responsibility, which affects the behaviour of road users. There is a danger in simply transplanting Dutch or Danish approaches to the UK. An important difference is the law surrounding traffic management. The UK does not have strict or presumed liability in road traffic law, where the default assumption is that the driver of a motor vehicle is liable to pay compensation if colliding with vulnerable road users. This is currently under debate in Scotland. It is interesting and perhaps bizarre that strict liability exists in UK law for owners of dangerous dogs and employers with potentially dangerous equipment, but not for drivers of motor vehicles - despite the 1,754 people killed on Britain’s roads in 2012 alone. While some cities such as Bristol, Cambridge and London have seen a significant increase in cycling over the last decade, in other places - ostensibly with ready-made infrastructure in place, such as Milton Keynes and Stevenage - cycling takeup has been much slower. The problem with segregated cycle routes is that their sole purpose has been to remove cyclists from the carriageway, to provide less hindrance for motor traffic. Unless cycle routes are specifically designed for the needs of cycle users they will remain underused and, as the evidence suggests, no safer than the highway. We know what cyclists’ needs are, and how to design for them: lanes should be direct, comfortable and attractive. Off-road routes need to have alignments that are well engineered and be wide enough not to feel cramped. Where routes coincide with roads, care needs to be taken to provide sufficient safe space for movement around vehicles. The problem with cycle provision in the UK is that historically it has always been seen as “a problem” to be overcome. This is based on the misplaced notion that it is cycling that is inherently risky, rather than presence of motor vehicles. Road traffic management has been concerned only with maximising capacity and minimising delay. Thankfully we are seeing a recognition that in fact better urban traffic management is achieved by limiting speed. The challenge for the UK now is to take cycling seriously enough to invest in the necessary quality of comprehensive, comfortable networks that will encourage people from four wheels to two."
"In the last two years, Erin Finafrock has lived in a trailer and at the homes of friends in three California cities. She has camped at a fairground and in between swaths of fire-blackened forest. She has slept on owl-print sheets in a tent next to a busy Oakland street. When the Camp fire tore through the town of Paradise and its surroundings in Butte county, California, in November 2018, it also upended her life. Finafrock, 34, was living in nearby Magalia with a boyfriend and cat, and had just months earlier found stability after years of addiction, homelessness and being away from her children. She had fallen in love with the quiet communities in the Sierra Nevada foothills. “I like small spaces,” she said. “When I got to Magalia, it was like a little piece of heaven. The forests and beautiful rivers everywhere.” It was near one of those rivers that a worn hook on an almost 100-year-old PG&E transmission tower failed, casting sparks into the brush below. Exacerbated by increasingly hot and dry conditions caused by the climate crisis, the wind-driven fire would become the deadliest and most destructive in California history. It killed 85 people and obliterated nearly 14,000 homes in an area that had long been more affordable than much of the state, displacing, at its peak, over 50,000 people. The scale of destruction was almost without precedent in modern US history. “We always have had some fire risk … but to lose a whole small city … it was really a shock to everyone,” said LeRoy Westerling, a fire scientist at UC Merced. Paradise is rebuilding – an estimated 3,000 people live there today – as are other areas affected by the fire, including Magalia, Concow and Butte Creek Canyon. But tens of thousands of its former residents have not returned. Some have rebuilt elsewhere, often after sojourns in hotels, parents’ guest bedrooms or on friends’ couches. Others are still struggling to find a place to call home. Affordability, trauma and concerns about the future of Paradise and the other Ridge communities have shaped decisions about where to go. Some have resettled nearby, hoping to stay close to their hometowns and families. Others have left the state, in search of a new inexpensive place to rebuild. All too often, those with the least resources have faced the greatest challenges. The fire has not only dramatically altered the lives of those affected by it, but the towns many of them have chosen to resettle in. More than 16,000 people displaced by the fire have moved to other Butte county communities. Chico, a university city of 110,000 close to Paradise, grew by more than 10,000 people. Nurse Matt Rosendin and his family were among those to eventually settle in Chico after they lost their 1950s-era home in Paradise. “It overlooked the canyon and it was like it was all ours,” Rosendin recalled about his property. After a difficult evacuation, during which Rosendin spent hours unsure if his wife had escaped the fast-moving fire, the couple sought shelter at his in-laws’ an hour south. They later moved to a rental home in Willows, 50 minutes from Paradise, before buying a home in Chico in April 2020. “One of my goals was to, as quickly as I could, get some stability and normalcy again,” Rosendin, a father of three, said. “There is no stability up there. It’s starting to come back but there were so many more questions than answers – what’s the town gonna look like? Is the water safe? Could we get insurance? … I just wanted to get back to a normal life.” The family had good insurance, Rosendin said, and they’ve been able to make a life for themselves in Chico, a community they had lived in previously. Chico has struggled to accommodate the sudden boom, which Mark Orme, the city manager, said was “like 15-20 years of population growth overnight”. Traffic, and collisions, waste management and sewage use increased significantly. Butte county was already facing a housing shortage, and the fire worsened it. Evacuees struggled to find apartments in the area, and in the month after the fire Chico had the top real estate market in the US in terms of interested buyers. The city has applied for grants for road projects, but hasn’t been able to expand fire and policing services to meet the population increase, Orme said. “We continue to try to find resources to help,” he said. “It’s a race to get back to that quality of life that is so cherished in this community. It’s been a strain on resources. We are finding a footing. We’ll get there.” It’s a scenario that’s likely to repeat itself in the coming century as the US sees more destructive natural disasters and increasingly extreme fires. The state saw a sweltering heatwave over the weekend and an onslaught of wildfires. More than 2m acres have burned this year, surpassing a record set in 2018. “That’s what the future is going to look like,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Tulane University, adding that cities that are at lower risk from phenomena such as sea level rise or wildfires should prepare for the possibility that large groups of people could seek refuge there. Keenan pointed at the ripple effects of such displacement. Chico will probably see rapid urbanization, much of it unplanned. The flood of new people in a small market has driven up real estate prices, complicating the lives of many for whom affordability was a key reason for living in the area. It isn’t just disasters themselves that push people out, Keenan continued. Even for those who don’t lose their homes, the stress of living in a high-risk area and the cost of insurance can also drive migration. In the communities affected by the Camp fire, remaining residents have seen their rates in some cases double, or drop entirely. “Your insurance going up is an economic burden. If you can’t get insurance then you’re in default on your mortgage and they can actually foreclose your mortgage,” Keenan said. “All of this imposes huge stress and duress on households.” Outside of Chico, a few hundred people remain in housing provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in the smaller communities in Butte and Glenn counties. Skye Sedwick, whose 82-year-old father, John, died after spending hours fighting the flames and saving neighbors’ homes, moved into a small trailer in Orland in early 2019 before landing in a two-bedroom at a temporary Fema community in Gridley. In recent months, she’s watched the complex of some 400 uniform, light grey manufactured homes slowly empty as families seek permanent housing elsewhere. The agency had planned to start collecting rent from residents, but announced last spring it would delay that until October amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sedwick plans to leave in the coming months. She wants to return to the Magalia property that’s been in her family for more than 70 years and build a home to share with her son and grandson. The fear that fire could return lingers, but she can’t bring herself to abandon the hill her father cherished with its majestic grey pines and Douglas firs and view of Sawmill Peak across the West Branch Feather River Canyon. “It’s a beautiful place and it’s mine,” she said. Others can’t bring themselves to return. Panda Bell, 35, lived in a quirky Paradise home, a converted church, with her disabled mother, stepson and husband. When they drove away with their three dogs on 8 November 2018, flames were encroaching on their fence and gazebo. Seeing their town overcome, flames all around them and the sound of explosions in the distance, was so traumatic Bell knew she could never live in Paradise again. For the first two months, Bell and her family bounced between relatives’ apartments and hotel rooms for a night or two when they could find them. They spent most hours in their Honda Pilot, gathering paperwork, driving to stores to purchase essentials, clothes and toiletries, and taking Stella, Remington and Sweet Pea to the dog park. It took two months for them to find a rental home, and shortly after, they bought a property in Orland, a town of just under 8,000, 45 minutes west of Paradise. It’s an almost three-acre plot, big enough for them to have goats and chickens and with room for the dogs to run around. Bell, who previously worked as a seller at a boutique, opened her own store where she sells home decor and Paradise-themed goods that are locally made. “All of our Paradise customers that knew me from the store come to Orland to shop with us. I still have my same customers,” she said. “I love it.” Still, it’s been a challenging period for the family. Bell’s mother, who had struggled in the aftermath of the fire, died earlier this year. “My mom was never quite the same after the fire,” she said. “My dad had passed a few years earlier … everything that was from their life together was lost.” The family has kept the Paradise property, unsure what they’ll do with it, but they won’t be returning. After the fire, Erin Finafrock stayed in different cities around Butte county, looking for permanent housing, but faced setback after setback, including the theft of an RV that someone donated to her before she ended up back in her hometown of Oakland, where she learned she was pregnant with twins. She now lives with her four children and aunt near Santa Rosa, thanks to the donations and support she received from a nonprofit after she was interviewed for a local news story and assistance from residents of the Ridge, who upon hearing her story sent thousands of dollars worth of items. Finafrock found a job and has been able to have all her children back in her life, she said. Despite the hardships she experienced, Finafrock stayed sober, something she is particularly proud of. She hopes to return to the Ridge or a nearby community. “I love these little towns,” she says. “I’ve been through a traumatic event with these people. They’re my family now.”"

When the left grumble about **“populism”** , what they really mean is that **the right are tapping into the popular mood** – and it’s driving the left crazy.



No matter how much they shout, finger-wag, hector and bully us, we hoi polloi just refuse to be told what to do by the left-elite. Trump, Brexit, Morrison, Bolsonaro, Orban, Johnson – **across the Western world, the left-elite are being given the collective middle finger**.



The parties of the right have triumphed in better reading the public mood and recasting their policies, even their identity to win.



The parties of the left have blown their brains out by squandering the public anger towards ­financial elites, compressed living standards and the alienation of working people who feel frustrated or betrayed — an ideal framing for left election victories. The left misread the times. Its world-historic failures have created the current opening for radical conservatives. Hillary Clinton and Bill Shorten expected to win; many of Corbyn’s backers believed he might pull off victory.



The left became consumed by ideological arrogance. It listened to its true believers and the liberal media.



The insular arrogance of the modern left has been nowhere better demonstrated than in the US, where the left has literally gathered to “scream helplessly at the sky”, while the left-dominated media watch on in mixed puzzlement and fury as their viewing numbers plummet.



Success in each case was built upon the left’s extremism. **The left made two specific mistakes — it misread culture and it misread class.** It embraced contemporary progressivism in its assault on traditional values and patriotic norms while its quest for individual self-expression spilling into gender, race and queer ideology only alienated the mainstream.



Its class campaigns were crude, old-fashioned and tired[…]



As **Lauren Southern** [has written](https://www.amazon.com/Barbarians-Boomers-Immigrants-Screwed-Generation/dp/1541136942), Westerners are rediscovering the virtue of nationalism. Not, as the left would have it, jackbooted, goose-stepping, right-arm raising “fascism”, but the simple virtues of love of one’s country and countrymen – regardless of their race.



The lesson is that nationalism retains its power into the 21st century because people link individual self-interest with national self-interest. This is the golden bridge to conservatism’s revival. Its power lies in its validity: individual destiny is chained to ­national destiny.



This strikes at one of the foundations of progressivism — its distaste for nation-state loyalty and its belief that a civilised people will accept the logic of a globalised world (think trade, capital flows, climate change and people movement) and substitute enlightened internationalism for emotive ­nationalism. The elites misjudged their own countries and the bedrock power of location, community and nation in the way people interpreted their lives.



So where does this leave the left, seemingly unshakeably wedded to the ideology of globalism, open borders, capital-M Multiculturalism and mass immigration from the Global South?



Can parties of the left escape from their current crisis? Consider Corbyn’s response to ­defeat. He believes he won on the issues[…]This is progressive dogmatism at its worst.



So long as the left remain locked in an isolation ward of social media echo-chambers, legacy media incestuousness and inner-city insularity, they are doomed to irrelevance.

"**The UK, EU and Nato have expressed concern and anger after China passed a controversial security law giving it new powers over Hong Kong.**
The law makes secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.
It took effect from 2300 local time (1500 GMT) on Tuesday.
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam defended the law, saying it filled a ""gaping hole"" in national security.
One key pro-democracy group said it was now ceasing all operations.
Demosisto announced the move on Facebook after Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, said he was leaving the group, which he had spearheaded.
The law has come into effect just a day before the 23rd anniversary of the return of sovereignty to China - a day that usually draws large pro-democracy protests.
China says the law is needed to tackle unrest and instability linked to a broadening pro-democracy movement.
Opponents say it undermines the autonomy set out in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was agreed when the territory's sovereignty was returned by the UK in 1997.
Civil liberties such as free speech, the right to protest and an independent and robust judiciary are at risk, they say.
There has been a mixture of concern for personal safety and defiance at the news.
Demosisto said several members had asked to be delisted and it had decided to ""dissolve and stop all meetings"". It said that the fight against ""totalitarian oppression"" would have to continue in a ""more flexible manner"".
Joshua Wong said the law marked ""the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before"".
But Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai said he would defy a ban on a ""handover day"" march scheduled for Wednesday, the South China Morning Post reports.
He will be joined by Figo Chan, of the Civil Human Rights Front, who urged people to take to the streets, saying: ""We are aware of the risks of being prosecuted. But we insist on taking the lead, as we want to tell Hongkongers not to fear.""
Police plan to have 4,000 riot officers on standby.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged China to ""step back from the brink"" and respect the rights of the people of Hong Kong.
He said: ""The success of Hong Kong, the entrepreneurial spirit, the vibrancy, the economic success, has been built on its autonomy in 'one country, two systems'... That clearly is at threat.""
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, said: ""It risks seriously undermining the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong and will have a detrimental impact on the judiciary and the rule of law and we deplore this decision.""
The last UK governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, said the law marked the end of one-country, two-systems.
Meanwhile, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""It is clear that China does not share our values - democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.""
Japan called the law ""regrettable"" and Taiwan even warned its citizens of risks in visiting Hong Kong.
The US has already begun taking steps to end Hong Kong's special status trade relationship, a move China on Tuesday said would be met with unspecified ""countermeasures"".
**Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent**
Hong Kong's sweeping new security law is a frighteningly open-ended tool to suppress political agitation.
Like similar laws on the Chinese mainland it appears that it can be manipulated to meet the needs of the Communist Party as required to crush almost any action deemed threatening.
Unlike elsewhere in China, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary. For this reason, the Party's leadership was not going to leave interpretation of this law in the hands of just any old judges.
No. Those who'll be allowed to preside in these matters will be hand-picked by Carrie Lam, the city's leader who was effectively installed by Beijing.
So, prior to the new security bill, which actions by activists - no matter how subversive - could not be dealt with under existing laws? What were ""extremists"" getting away with to warrant this new legislation?
Bomb making? No. Smashing up buildings? No. Meeting with international NGOs to talk about the city's deteriorating freedoms? Ahhhh. Perhaps. Publicly advocating Hong Kong independence? Almost certainly.
The more that Beijing, under Xi Jinping's leadership, has sought to control Hong Kong, the more it has driven residents into the pro-democracy camp.
But he is playing a long game. Sure, handover promises to the UK were made but he was not going to let some Western attachment to liberty trump loyalty to the motherland. Not on his watch. Enter the security law.
The law, announced by Beijing in May, will make criminal any act of secession, subversion of the central government, terrorism or collusion with foreign or external forces.
State news agency Xinhua said the six-chapter law had 66 articles, clearly setting out the terms of the four offences.
A new office in Hong Kong will deal with national security cases, but will also have other powers such as overseeing education about national security in Hong Kong schools.
In addition, the city will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser.
Hong Kong's chief executive will have the power to appoint judges to hear national security cases, a move which has raised fears about judicial independence.
Importantly, Beijing will have power over how the law should be interpreted. If the law conflicts with any Hong Kong law, the Beijing law takes priority.
In a video address to the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said crimes under the new law would be clearly defined.
She said the law would only target a ""small minority"" and would not undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, adding: ""We respect differences in opinion.""
In recent years, Hong Kong has seen waves of protests demanding more rights. Last year, rallies over a now-scrapped bill permitting extraditions to the mainland turned violent and fuelled a broad pro-democracy movement."

On the weekend both [National MP **Judith Collins** ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/120815679/heres-how-coronavirus-will-change-us-judith-collins)and [Green MP Chloe **Swarbrick**](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/120807860/opinion--the-way-things-were-thats-no-longer-our-future) had opinion pieces published by _Stuff_. Both opinion pieces had the theme of change.



I thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast their views on our lockdown since they are so very different.



One writer is a very experienced electorate MP and the other is a very young list MP. One is pragmatic while the other is idealistic. One is a centrist, the other a socialist. One is outcome-driven, the other is ideology-driven. So how did their views compare?



Judith pointed out some cold, hard facts.



[…] he could have said, we are going into a period of financial meltdown, where, as a trading nation, some markets will dissolve. All the relationship building between nations and trading partners will be for nought if we cannot trade.



[…] A committee decided what are essential services and products and, surprisingly, butchers are not – unless they work in a nationwide chain of supermarkets. Top quality food to feed families has been consigned to the rubbish tip because it wasn’t deemed essential by the committee.



Chloe talked about the “ **collective** ” and used the word “ **we** ” repeatedly.



[…] **We** rely on each other. **We** always have.



One day, **we** will have navigated our way across this new landscape […] **We** will have done it by supporting our neighbours, practicing physical distancing […] That day, **we** will have left nobody behind. Even if **we** had wanted to be so callous or careless as to do so, **we** would be setting sail to a safer horizon with umpteen holes in the boat. **We** would doom ourselves to sink, to lose, and to start all over again. The risk to all of our health is **collective. We** are only as safe as the most vulnerable and marginalised.



When **we** , together, have removed the immediate threat to our lives and our health, things will not look or feel like they did before. And all of us will be changed, too.



 **We** will know that kindness is not performance nor a veneer. It is the necessary glue of communities, compromise and collaboration. It is the oxygen that keeps relationships healthy.



We will know what it is like to live in the confines of circumstances drawn by powers outside of our control. **We** will feel deep empathy for New Zealanders pushed to the margins by poverty and problems beyond our surface-level comprehension. **We** will reflect on the deep trauma and pain known intimately to those fleeing war-torn countries from persecution and violence, and remember we fought over toilet paper.



Judith talked about what we will need to do as **individuals** to help our economy when lockdown ends.



Things have moved quickly. Businesses are failing. Exporters are asking themselves how long will it take to resurrect their markets and is it worth it? Directors are concerned that they are trading insolvent companies, in contravention of the Law. Tourism, hospitality, and tertiary education are seriously damaged. We are trebly grateful to our primary producers especially if their markets in China hold up.



As a nation, we will be changed. The economy will have changed. We will be changed socially, politically and constitutionally.



We will decide to end social isolation and take to the cafes (those that have survived) with gusto. It will be our duty to support what is left of the economy and keep people employed. We will rush to businesses that the COVID-19 Czars deemed non-essential and hope we have the cash to spend and hope they survived.



Chloe talks about how the lockdown is teaching us that the collective is better than the individual and that it is the collective not the selfish individual that will save the day. She also waxes lyrical about nature. COVID-19 is used as a stepping stone for a Green revolution! Damn the GDP she wants “ **collaboration and care** ”!



We will know that things we had once been told were politically impossible, like housing the homeless and flexibility of working arrangements for the disabled and those with children, were **simply a matter of priority.** We will understand that it is only through our shared effort in jobs across this country that all of our welfare increases, and that our historical wages for carers, nurses, teachers, fruit-pickers and posties have not reflected their critical role in uplifting the rest of us.



We will respect the pace of nature, as we found solidarity in trodding [ _sic_ ] along the footsteps of those who walked our parks and trails moments before we arrived. We will hear reprieve in the amplified birdsong of undisrupted native fauna and witness the unfurling of uninhibited flora. We will breathe, and find peace in belonging, not belongings.



When we reach our destination, some who used to enjoy their perch at the top of an old-world pyramid will begin to feel nostalgic. They will tell us, when we’ve worked in sync, in homes and bubbles across Aotearoa New Zealand to cast off COVID-19, that we’ve got to pick up shovels and rebuild the society that placed us in **unkind, unsustainable, unequal hierarchies.** They will tell us that we are not all in this together, and that this is a matter of survival of the fittest. They will ask us to snap out of it, and to get back to competing against each other. Collaboration and care might be good for your wellbeing, they will mutter, but it doesn’t show up in GDP.



Judith expresses her view that our COVID-19 experience will result in New Zealanders caring more for nationalism than globalism although she doesn’t use those terms. She says, **“We will be more about New Zealand and less about the World.”** She points out the evils currently happening under lockdown.



We will regret the ‘dob-in’ culture currently being encouraged. We will have lost some respect for the Rule of Law when we see ‘the law’ being made up on the hoof. We will ask ourselves, why did we not question the government more in the early days of COVID-19 and then remember that to have done so would have opened ourselves up to condemnation for being either alarmist or, even worse, uncaring.



We will look again at Australia and wonder how their government managed to give every business and sole trader a wage subsidy of A$1500 per fortnight of each staff member and we will regret that our government thought that NZ$585 a week would be sufficient to keep us working when the JobSeeker (“the Dole”) already pays up to $428 a week for not working.



We will note the Aussies called theirs a JobKeeper payment. We will spot the difference. We will wonder how the Australians managed payments of up to A$100,000 to every business and NGO that employs people to pay their rent and other costs.



We will wonder why the government that talked so much about housing development decided to add climate change into RMA decisions by local Councils and we will wonder how that could happen without adequate public consultation. We will be ready to embrace infrastructure on a scale not seen since the “Think Big” days.



And when anyone mentions Greta, we will ask, “Who?”



Chloe finishes her piece by referring to business owners as “These people” and by using a straw man argument.



These people will ache for the world they knew, and the rules they influenced which aided their race to the finish line and threw barriers in others’ way. They will ask us to reapply blinkers, because as Margaret Thatcher said, “There is no such thing as society.”



They will ask working people to shoulder what they say is the cost of the rebuild. It’s the only way, they will say.



And we will know they are lying. We will have already proven our potential. We will know we’re better than that.

"China’s Communist Party celebrated its 95th birthday this summer with a lavish First of July gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In Shanghai, where the First National Congress took place in 1921, the occasion was noted in a more subdued way, with the promotion of a digital map of the important sites of the party’s heroic early years in   Shanghai. The map is a simple affair. Clicking on a man wearing scholar’s robes, for example, sends a cartoon icon toddling off to the brick building on Lane 163 of Zizhong Road, where Chen Wangdao, one of the party’s founding members, translated “The Communist Manifesto” into Chinese. (A   and   app version will soon be available for smartphones.) A problem for anyone contemplating a   pilgrimage to the urban shrines of the Communist Party: Much of the historic city depicted on the virtual map has been wiped off the real map of Shanghai by two decades of breakneck development. The few remaining buildings, among them Dr. Sun  ’s modest   mansion in the former French Concession, stand in the shadows of   or   towers. On a recent visit, my quest to find Mao Zedong’s first address in Shanghai, on a street once known as the Alley of Benevolence and Kindness, ended in the Jing An Kerry Center, a 3.    residential and office complex. The   rowhouse, where the future Great Helmsman once folded laundry and ate rice in an attic room, now sits between a   luxury mall and the     Hotel’s steakhouse. Fortunately, enough examples of Shanghai’s historic architecture have survived to give visitors a sense of what life was like when the city gave birth to the Communist Party. To walk through Shanghai’s last remaining shikumen (alleyway complexes entered through a   kumen, or gateway) is to return to the wicked, glamorous “Paris of the Orient”  —   and to get a glimpse of what has happened to Shanghai in the century since then. My first introduction to shikumen came 10 years ago, when Peter Hibbard, the former president of the Shanghai chapter of the Royal Asiatic Society China, took me on a tour of an alleyway complex near the riverfront Bund. “Up until the ’90s, 80 percent of the population lived in two or   shikumen,” Mr. Hibbard told me then, as we wandered through an atmospheric maze of mostly vacant homes. “They were basically city blocks that functioned as gated communities, with guards manning the front entrance. The whole essence of old Shanghai was that life was lived horizontally  —   all the activity happened at street level. ” Though the complex Mr. Hibbard showed me has since been razed, you can get an idea of what shikumen were like by visiting Xintiandi, a reconditioned alleyway complex located in the Huangpu and Xuhui districts, which were until 1943 the city’s French Concession. The houses at 76 and 78 Xingye Road were saved from the wrecker’s ball only because they played host to the clandestine First National Congress of the Communist Party. Turned into a memorial 30 years later, by which time the private residences had become a noodle factory, they are now a museum and the cornerstone of Xintiandi (the name means “New Heaven and Earth”) a   shopping and entertainment district. On the second floor of a thoroughly modern exhibition space, the Congress is commemorated in the orthodox Communist way  —   with starkly lit wax figures displayed behind glass. The skinny rowhouses that brought together two European members of the Comintern, 12 future party bigwigs and a    Mao have been preserved intact. Visitors walk through a lacquered partition into a   room with whitewashed walls. On a polished red floor, a dozen stools surround a long table, set with teacups and an open box of wooden matches  —   a staging meant to suggest the participants have just left. (The meeting was, in fact, cut short by the sudden appearance of a police informer. Mao and his colleagues fled before the police could raid, reconvening on rented sightseeing boats in the tourist town of Hangzhou.) Wandering the lanes of Xintiandi gives a hint of the magic of the typical shikumen. Faced with   bricks and adorned with elaborately carved,   lintels, the rowhouses call to mind a radically compacted version of the terraced workers’ housing found in northern English cities. The tributary lanes, some only eight feet wide, were built to accommodate rickshaws and bicycles, rather than cars, making shikumen tranquil oases in the heart of a   city. Commissioned mostly by Western developers, the first shikumen appeared in the 1870s, designed to offer wealthy families refuge from the flooding, famine and unrest of the countryside. The local contractors who built them drew upon the interior floor plans of traditional Chinese courtyard homes and local decorative motifs. The Shikumen Open House Museum, a refurnished private residence in the north block of Xintiandi, demonstrates the beguiling collision of East and West that resulted. Leaving an exiguous forecourt  —   the equivalent of a front yard, generally used to wash and dry clothes  —   you take a big step over a wooden sill into a rectangular living room decorated with blackwood furniture and period photographs and paintings. As you walk over creaking floorboards, soft jazz emanates from the horn of a gramophone. A woman’s sleeveless silk qipao hangs from a hook a jade hair clip, a tube of lipstick and a jar of powder are neatly arranged on a dressing table. In the kitchen, bamboo baskets,   colanders and a huge iron kettle are arranged around a potbellied coal stove. Halfway up a precipitous, dogleg staircase is the tingzijian, an unheated room often rented to bachelors. (Among them were the modernist writers Lu Xun and Yu Dafu, who eavesdropped on shikumen life from their    pavilion rooms). The upper floor is occupied by bedrooms, some with impressive   beds. The overall impression is of a luxurious, and surprisingly spacious, upper   home. It’s all beautifully staged, and terribly misleading. By the late 1930s, when the Second   War caused a wave of immigration to Shanghai’s   zones, most shikumen homes became occupied by four families and sheltered an average of 20 people. As an idealized vision of rowhouse life, the Open House Museum is like Xintiandi itself. Until the 1990s, the area was home to 2, 000 families. Their homes were gutted, and often completely rebuilt, to make way for a shopping district where you can buy a latte at Starbucks, a mug of pilsner at the Paulaner Bräuhaus or an   expensive silk scarf at the upscale clothing chain Shanghai Tang. “Xintiandi is fake vintage,” said Ruan Yisan, the director of the National Research Center of Historic Cities at Tongji University and an architectural preservationist. “There aren’t many shikumen houses left in the city. Those that remain are the living fossil of life in Shanghai. ” Professor Ruan remembers his teenage years in a Shanghai shikumen fondly. The day typically began with the “Cantata of the Alley,” the sound of night stools (  latrines) as they were cleaned with bamboo sticks after being emptied by night soil men. Then the first vendors would arrive, selling   won tons, fried bean curd and fresh green olives, often delivered in baskets lowered from   windows. The alleys echoed with the cries of children running off to school, often within the same complex. During unexpected cloudbursts, the   grandma would rush to bring in clothes that absent neighbors had hung out to dry. In the summer, residents would gather after dinner to cheng fengliang (“enjoy the coolness”) trading gossip, playing   and sharing slices of melon chilled in a water well. “Nowadays, our apartments in condominium towers have no public spaces,” he said. “We don’t even know our neighbors. ” The shikumen, Professor Ruan believes, forged the character of the Shanghainese. Contact with foreigners and people from all parts of China made them cosmopolitan, and living cheek by jowl with neighbors made them into subtle   planners, capable of sidestepping    disputes while quietly plotting to further their own interests. He tells me that when shikumen construction ended in 1949, Shanghai counted 9, 000 alleyway complexes, housing up to four million people. The entire spectrum of Shanghai’s life took place in them: Shikumen housed nurseries and coffin makers, universities and Buddhist temples, hotels and   zones (the infamous Alley of Joint Pleasure was home to 171 brothels). Demolitions began in the 1990s, and intensified in the   to Expo 2010. Most expropriated residents were offered  —   and accepted  —   relocation, usually to new residential towers up to an hour’s metro ride from their old homes. (Holdouts found themselves harassed, and in a few notorious cases even killed, by construction crews.) Professor Ruan believes that only 200, 000 Shanghai residents continue to live in alleyway complexes. “If you want to see what a typical shikumen is like,” he said, “you’d better hurry. ” I rode the metro to the Xinzha Road station and walked a few blocks to eastern Siwen Li (Gentle Lane). Built over a former cemetery by a Sephardic Jewish entrepreneur in 1914, it was once home to 11, 000 people now it’s down to 12 households. After I stepped through its threshold, the smell of exhaust was replaced by air redolent with frying garlic and stewing meat. Brownish   exteriors were plastered with peeling posters for “anticorpulence tablets” or scrawled with cellphone numbers of plumbers or fake ID peddlers. Many of the doors were daubed in red paint with the Chinese character “Kōng” (“Vacant”). Between concrete sinks used for washing clothes, bicycles leaned against walls. Somewhere a rooster crowed. At the intersection of two alleys, a   residents had gathered on stools to pass the time. When I told one of them, Ni Wei Ming, 57, a taxi driver, that I had never seen the inside of a real shikumen home, he invited me into his. Though its    —   forecourt for washing clothes, rectangular living room, steep rear staircase leading to   bedrooms  —   mirrors the shikumen home in the Xintiandi museum, it lacked its idealized glamour. Room partitions were made of plastic sheets joined by duct tape cooking amenities were limited to a wok on a   hot plate the bathtub was a   wooden barrel. Though the government had offered to buy it for 7 million yuan (just over $1 million) Mr. Ni told me he was holding out for more. “That would be enough money to be comfortable,” he said. “But I’ll still have regrets. My primary school was here. I met my wife here  —   she lived on the same block. My children did their homework with the neighbors’ kids. There used to be a real feeling of community. Now there are only seven families left on my alley. ” Mr. Ni told me there was a rumor that a Hong Kong property developer planned to replace the complex with skyscrapers. Seeing me back to the laneway  —   beneath the asphalt lie the original cobblestones  —   Mr. Ni lit a cigarette and let his gaze run down the row of carved lintels that marked the entrance to each home. “You know, if they chose to save and restore this place, it would be better than Xintiandi,” he said. (Since my visit, the municipal government has earmarked 260 historic neighborhoods for conservation. The Shanghai office of Chipperfield Architects will oversee the preservation of eastern Siwen Li’s buildings  —   minus, unfortunately, the neighbors who made it into a neighborhood. The life stories of the shikumen’s residents have been collected in a beautifully illustrated book by the French architect Jérémy Cheval.) Other shikumen are scattered among Shanghai’s office and residential towers. Fude Li, where the Communist Party’s Second National Congress took place, is intact (Mao, who got lost in Shanghai’s back streets, failed to attend). The extraordinary Zhang’s Garden off West Nanjing Road, built by a Chinese merchant in 1882, has been saved from demolition because of its role as a community center for seniors. Less picturesque complexes, though, tend to be occupied by migrant workers, many of whom lack of residency permits, which makes the future of these homes tenuous. Perhaps the quickest way to get an idea of the vitality of a traditional alleyway complex is to visit Tianzifang, a   walk from the Dapuqiao station. In the late ’90s, the small factories and shikumen homes along Lane 210 on Taikang Road were occupied by painters, sculptors and ceramists. Their tiny workshops eventually became a complex of 200   cultural and art sites, with older residents continuing to occupy   apartments. Though local residents lament that cafes, restaurants and small businesses have begun to replace artists’ studios, the district retains its original architecture and charm. The narrow cobbled lanes, shaded by trees and potted plants, are filled with window shoppers and diners who have stopped at a terrace to enjoy exquisite   Japanese coffee (Café Dan) or a chocolate milkshake or a smoked salmon bagel (Kommune). Unlike Xintiandi’s international chains, Tianzifang is home to such quirky local businesses as Pureland, which specializes in   ceramic tile images of koi ponds, pagodas and other traditional Chinese landscapes, and Teddy Bear Family, a Thai restaurant where every surface is covered with plush toys. Wandering around   Tianzifang is an antidote to the soaring Shanghai of magnetic levitation trains and  . Like other shikumen, it’s free of cars, making it one of the rare places in Shanghai where you can stroll without having to watch out for a darting electric bike or a barreling Volkswagen taxi. It’s a gentle reminder, too, of an irony of Shanghai’s recent history. In tearing down shikumen, which fostered the canny interdependence of the Shanghainese, government officials are erasing the architectural form that saw the birth of the uniquely Chinese version of Communism. The condominium towers that are replacing them, where   neighbors remain strangers, are breeding nothing but isolation."
"The Government will probably reintroduce the Renewable Energy Targets Bill (The RENT Scheme) very soon. The Liberals are unlikely to stop it – they are too engrossed in considerations of survival, and too many are hostage to Green dreamers, Green Industry speculators and vested interests lined up to profit from suffering electricity consumers.
This bill has nothing to commend it.
Firstly, the whole idea of the Emissions Trading Systems beloved by the Lib-Lab party and the merchant banking speculators is that it allows the market to determine the cheapest way to reduce emissions. It is totally negated when politicians mandate or subsidise certain energy systems. Thus the Rent Scheme should be shelved until the fate of the Ration-N-Tax Scheme is finally decided.
Secondly, it would be foolish in the extreme to force Australian industry to pay elevated electricity costs before it is clear what is coming out of the IPCC talkfest in Copenhagen in December, and what our international competitors are doing.
Thirdly, there is no chance that a force fed program to force solar/wind to supply 20% of Australia’s power will succeed without the risk of disruptions to power supplies and rapidly escalating costs for electricity and gas (which will be needed to back up unreliable green power).
And finally, the environmental “benefits” are very doubtful. When the massive land dislocation, and the minerals, energy and emissions resulting from the manufacture and installation of thousands of wind towers and solar panels are fully accounted for, we may find that Green Power is not so green after all.
This bill should be postponed until a full sensible assessment is made.

According to news reports, the recent heat wave in California resulted in about 150 deaths. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that global warming will exacerbate the problem dramatically, doubling or tripling the number of heat‐​related fatalities in North American cities in the next decade. The UN is dead wrong, because it assumes what climate researchers call the “Stupid People Hypothesis”: that people will simply sit around and fry to death without doing anything to beat the heat.



Global warming or not, our cities are warming, and will continue to do so. Sprawling masonry and blacktop retain heat, and the density of urban construction prevents wind from cooling it off. (Here in DC, there’s an additional warming effect: waste heat from all the money changing hands.)



But heat and heat‐​related deaths are not synonymous. In fact, in several refereed papers published in recent years, my Virginia colleague Robert Davis and I demonstrated that heat‐​related deaths have, in aggregate, declined significantly as our cities have warmed. In fact, in a statistical sense, we have completely engineered heat‐​related mortality out of several of our urban cores, particularly in eastern cities like Philadelphia.



Considering every decade of mortality data at once is misleading; examining it decade‐​by‐​decade is more informative. When looked at sequentially, the data reveals a remarkable adaptation: as cities have warmed, the “threshold” temperatures at which mortality begins to increase have also risen—more than the temperatures of the cities.



For example, in Philadelphia in the 1960s, mortality began to increase once the high temperature exceeded 83°. In the 1970s, the mortality threshold rose to the low 90s. In the last decade, there has been little evidence for _any_ threshold at which mortality increases. In other words, people have adapted to their changing climate.



How? Instead of simmering, people buy air conditioning. Every level of government warns of the danger of excessive exposure to heat, and people seek out cooler places.



Social adaptation can take place very quickly. In mid‐​July 1995, over 500 people died from an intense weekend heat wave in Chicago. Research by University of Illinois climatologist Michael Palecki, published in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_ in 2001, shows that a 1999 Chicago heat wave of comparable intensity resulted in only 15% as many deaths.



This summer’s heat is a bit unusual. Usually, when it’s very hot in the eastern U.S., temperatures are normal or below average in the West, or vice‐​versa. This year it’s hot everywhere. 



Is history repeating itself, or is global warming at work? It’s hard to say. Several summers in the 1930s were known for intense heat across the nation.1930 was a scorcher: in rural Virginia, far from Washington’s sprawl, people suffered a total of 21 triple‐​digit days. Even with the excess heat contributed by the growth of the city, Washington currently averages only one 100° day per year.



The fact is that we cannot completely discriminate between repetitive history and prospective warming when it comes to a single summer. The better place to look for warming is in the winter. Greenhouse‐​effect theory predicts that the coldest temperatures of winter will rise much more sharply than the hottest ones of summer. And indeed, for the last several decades, winter’s lows have warmed out of proportion to summer’s highs.



All of which illustrates the complexity of global warming. Would people accept—even welcome?—climate change that greatly alleviated winter discomfort at the cost of slightly higher summer temperatures?



Clearly, people have adapted to the heat. The evidence shows that, the warmer the city, the more quickly its residents adapt. Heat‐​related deaths are increasing in only one major American city: chilly Seattle. San Francisco and Los Angeles, two other cities that are relatively cool in the summer compared to those to their east, show no change in mortality.



As the UN’s climatologists should recognize, heat waves are dangerous when they are rare and unexpected, because people are unfamiliar with them and slow to take appropriate actions to minimize their exposure. As heat waves become more common, we will simply be better prepared for them and incorporate them into our daily lives and routines—just as the people of Phoenix and Dallas and Houston and New Orleans do, every summer day. Because they’re not stupid.

Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction.
Therefore everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us.
– Ludwig von Mises Socialism.
The above passage was written by the great economist and political philosopher, Ludwig von Mises, in German, in 1922. His massive book “Socialism” demolishes the whole idea that centrally planned economies can ever produce prosperity or freedom.

"Kiah Stokes celebrated New Year’s Eve at a nightclub in Istanbul, where she plays basketball for Besiktas of the Turkish league. But a night of revelry turned alarming when club employees told patrons they had to shut down early for security reasons. As Stokes and her friends left the building, they saw   roads. They cautiously walked for about 10 minutes before finding a taxi to take them home, not knowing that a gunman had killed 39 people at another club down the street and was still at large. “You don’t think something can happen,” said Stokes, who, in September, finished her second season with the Liberty of the W. N. B. A. “Now I’m like, ‘Wow, this is just scary. ’” Players like Stokes have long packed up after the W. N. B. A. season and spent their winters abroad, competing with teams that offer larger paychecks than the women can earn in the American league. This   more W. N. B. A. players ended up in Turkey than in any other country. There are now 26, according to the league’s players’ association. The unrest there  —   an attempted coup last summer and multiple terrorist attacks  —   has led some players to question the costs of taking a second job overseas. It has also added urgency to efforts to keep W. N. B. A. players in the United States in the  . “It’s kind of sad we can’t stay home,” said Liberty guard Sugar Rodgers, who played for the Turkish club Osmaniye but returned to Virginia in November because she did not feel safe. About two weeks after the Liberty were eliminated from the playoffs, Rodgers joined Osmaniye, which is based about two hours from the Syrian border. Shortly after her arrival, a car bombing killed at least 17 people at a checkpoint in Syria’s Aleppo Province. “That right there shook me,” said Rodgers, who has also played in France, Israel and Slovakia. She acknowledged that the United States was not immune to such violence, but in Turkey, the threat of danger felt almost constant. “Getting emails saying families from embassies are leaving  —   the consulate or embassy were leaving  —   that rings a bell,” Rodgers said. She soon got out of her contract. “My team was understanding,” Rodgers said, adding, “I’m not going to play to my full potential always watching over my back. ” As Turkey became increasingly unstable last year, the W. N. B. A. and the players’ association arranged new security measures for the women who would go overseas in the  . In late December, the league provided an app that would allow players to communicate easily with the W. N. B. A. office from anywhere in the world. In an emergency, the office can give information about safe areas and contacts. Jayne    —   the union’s associate director of player relations, who competed in China and Turkey as well as in the W. N. B. A.  —   set up and maintained a group chat for the league’s players in Turkey. When Terri Carmichael Jackson, a former N. C. A. A. executive, became the director of operations for the players’ association last May, she focused on improving security for players overseas. The union met with the league’s director of security, Eric Rhodes, who suggested more collaboration with the State Department and some relatively simple measures, like pointing players to the department’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. The program, a State Department spokesman said, allows travelers to “receive messages from the nearest U. S. Embassy or Consulate, which stand at the ready to assist U. S. citizens abroad. ” “We get news of an incident,” Jackson said, “and we kind of have a   plan in place, informally, here in the office. ” She added, “There’s always a concern there might be a blackout with media and news services. ” Lisa M. Borders, the W. N. B. A.’s president, was attending church services when she heard about the Istanbul attack. Last season, her first as president, Borders gave her personal cellphone number to every player in the league. Until New Year’s Eve, it was seen primarily as a gesture of good will. Borders said that after contacting the league’s security officials that night for instructions, she reached out to players individually. She declined to name which players had communicated with her. “I feel compelled to be deeply engaged with my players overseas, as well as domestically,” she said. “Speaking to players immediately in harm’s way is very relieving to me  —   that I can reach them with a phone call, that they will answer me or FaceTime me and let me know what’s happening. ” Players have noticed the league’s increased efforts to ensure their safety abroad. But many pointed out that they would not feel the need to leave the United States if their W. N. B. A. salaries were higher. According to the most recent   agreement,   players in the W. N. B. A. received a base salary of $39, 676 to $50, 617 in 2016, not including performance bonuses, housing stipends and other benefits. A player in her third year made as much as $54, 609. The most recent   agreement also included a $50, 000   bonus for each team to distribute among players who limit their overseas competition to three months or less. Aside from relieving security fears, an athlete who stays in the United States avoids the physical stress of an extra basketball season. The league also offers professional internships and   programs for the   and it is considering other ways to keep players home in the winter. “I get it,” Borders said. “You want to make sure you are having one job making enough money to pay bills, sustain family and do things we all want to do. That day will come. ” The league needs more revenue for that to happen, she said, adding that her chief operating officer, Jay Parry, met early this month with executives from each team to explore ways to increase attendance. Stokes, who did not disclose her Besiktas salary, said she would probably forgo her second job if the W. N. B. A. could replace most of her overseas income. An ESPN article in 2012 quoted an agent’s estimate that the average overseas salary for a female basketball player was $72, 000. For now, Stokes plans to remain in Turkey until the season ends in early May, despite the hazards. A few weeks before the New Year’s Eve attack, dozens of people were killed in a double bombing outside Besiktas’s soccer stadium, about a mile from where Stokes lives. “It freaked me out,” she said. She had read about the country’s turmoil during the summer, but she took comfort in knowing that a Liberty teammate who had played in Turkey before, Shavonte Zellous, would also be on the Besiktas team. But Zellous said her past experience in the country did not match what she was seeing this season. “The cities they’re bombing, I never imagined terror groups doing something in these cities,” Zellous said. “I think stuff is really getting real now. ” Stokes said that security measures had become noticeably stronger at games and that the team had more frequent police escorts on the road. She also said that she had become attached to her Turkish team and felt a certain level of commitment to it, even if friends and family yearn for her to return. “My mom wants me to come home right now,” Stokes said. “She said it’s too dangerous, it’s scary. She knows the money is good, but it’s not worth it. It definitely crossed my mind. ”"

The latest installment of the ongoing melodrama about global warming occurred last week with the release of the Clinton administration’s “U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change for the Nation.” 



To be sure, there will be some upsides to warming (primarily greater agricultural yields), but for the most part the report predicts doom and gloom for the coming century. 



While the press is eating this stuff up (“End is near” makes a pretty good headline), the public is showing remarkably good judgment by heavily discounting these prophesies of apocalypse.



Let us start by considering how hard it is to forecast the weather, even for the upcoming weekend. Then consider the hit‐​and‐​miss nature of predictions about what kind of summer or winter might be in store for us in any given year. Then ponder the difficulties of predicting weather patterns 100 years out. It boggles the mind, particularly when we reflect on all the industrial and technological changes that will heavily influence the extent of greenhouse gas emissions and our ability to mitigate them. The assessment, to its credit, frankly acknowledges the uncertainties, but they are noted in passing and not allowed to intrude on the parade of horribles that march through the report. 



Surprisingly, the report begins by postulating a 5‐​to‐​10 degree Fahrenheit warming over this century, a range far higher than that predicted by the computer models used in the report (which predicted warming between 3.6 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit). Moreover, there are two fundamental problems with the assumptions relied on by the computers. 



First, the report’s computer modelers postulated a 1 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions each year, a figure 2.5 greater than the observed 0.4 percent annual increase in emissions over the past two decades. Even the somewhat‐​alarmist International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts only an annual 0.63 percent emissions increase over this century. That simple error alone reduces the warming predicted in the assessment by one‐​third to one‐​half. 



Second, the models assume that warming will dramatically accelerate in the future because air pollution from sulfate aerosols, which is thought to artificially cool the planet, will decrease. Yet the “sulfate‐​masking” hypothesis has been torn to shreds by scientists in the peer‐​reviewed literature, and even NASA’s James Hansen, perhaps the world’s foremost expert on climate change, no longer believes that pollution is temporarily protecting us from the full brunt of global warming. 



The report generates most of its disaster scenarios by assuming a relatively even distribution of this dramatic warming, but the data clearly show that warming has thus far been fairly modest and almost entirely concentrated in the far northern latitudes, at night and during the winter. There is good reason for this: Cold, dry air masses warm faster and to a greater extent than moist air for any given increment of greenhouse gas emissions. 



Moreover, warming moist air increases cloud cover, which reduces temperatures during the day but increases them at night. Most climatologists believe that warming nighttime winter temperatures in the north would result in benign or largely positive changes in climate. 



Finally, there is the report’s dubious prediction that warmer weather will cause more extreme weather events. Even the IPCC notes there is no evidence extreme weather events are more likely now than they were in the past, despite the century‐​long buildup of greenhouse gases. In fact, the number of storms and other extreme weather events, along with their severity, are trending down, not up. One can find just as many peer‐​reviewed articles arguing those downward trends will continue as articles arguing the opposite. 



It should surprise no one the “national assessment” has political fingerprints all over it. A senior scientist involved in the project told the New York Times that the report’s conclusions are still subject to revision but that the administration was determined to release the summary now to affect the November elections. The summary itself plays up the degree of “stakeholder involvement” in the development of the report, a clear signal that politically active interest groups had a hand in the document. 



And not surprisingly, the press releases accentuate the negative, even though the report concludes that, despite these worst‐​case assumptions about warming trends, society will likely have little trouble adjusting to climate‐​induced changes. 



The assessment, in sum, sheds more heat than light on the future impact of climate change. But in an election year, what else should we really expect?

“Perhaps this wrenching transformation of our society could be justified if the doom and gloom forecasts of catastrophic consequences of man-caused global warming were correct. However, over 32 thousand scientists in the US alone are now saying there is no convincing scientific evidence that man is causing global warming. Thousands of leading scientists around the world have radically changed their minds because emerging science is increasingly negating the man-caused theory.
“Science is also showing that CO2 is a miracle gas that has increased global food production by over 12 percent. It will continue to do so at an increasing rate. At best, passing the Waxman-Markey bill is not in the nation’s best interest. It is pure folly. At worst, it is insanity.
“It is all pain and no climate gain”.

"The air outside my window is yellow today. It was orange yesterday. The Air Quality Index is over 200. The Environmental Protection Agency defines this as a “health alert” in which “everyone may experience more serious health effects if they are exposed for 24 hours”. Unfortunately, the index has been over 200 for several days.  The west is burning. Wildfires in California, Oregon and Washington are incinerating homes, killing scores of people, sickening many others, causing hundreds of thousands to evacuate, burning entire towns to the ground, consuming millions of acres, and blanketing the western third of the United States with thick, acrid and dangerous smoke. Yet the president has said and done almost nothing. A month ago, Trump wanted to protect lives in Oregon and California from “rioters and looters”. He sent federal forces into the streets of Portland and threatened to send them to Oakland and Los Angeles. Today, Portland is in danger of being burned and Oakland and Los Angeles are under health alerts. Trump will visit California on Monday, but he has said little. One reason: these states voted against him in 2016 and he still bears a grudge. He came close to rejecting California’s request for emergency funding. “He told us to stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down because he was so rageful that people in the state of California didn’t support him,” said former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor. Another explanation for Trump’s silence is that the wildfires are tied to human-caused climate change, which Trump has done everything humanly possible to worsen. Extreme weather disasters are rampaging across America. On Wednesday, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration released its latest State of the Climate report, finding that just in August the US was hit by four billion-dollar calamities. In addition to wildfires, there were two enormous hurricanes and an extraordinary Midwest derecho. These are inconvenient facts for a president who has spent much of his presidency dismantling every major climate and environmental policy he can lay his hands on. Starting with his unilateral decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, Trump has been the most anti-environmental president in history. He has called climate change a “hoax”. He has claimed, with no evidence, that windmills cause cancer. He has weakened Obama-era limits on planet-warming carbon dioxide from power plants and from cars and trucks. He has rolled back rules governing clean air, water and toxic chemicals. He has opened more public land to oil and gas drilling. He has targeted California in particular, revoking the state’s authority to set tougher car emission standards than those required by the federal government. In all, the Trump administration has reversed, repealed, or otherwise rolled back nearly 70 environmental rules and regulations. More than 30 rollbacks are still in progress. Now, seven weeks before election day, with much of the nation either aflame or suffering other consequences of climate change, Trump unabashedly defends his record and attacks Joe Biden. “The core of [Biden’s] economic agenda is a hard-left crusade against American energy,” Trump harrumphed in a Rose Garden speech last month. Not quite. While Biden has made tackling climate change a centerpiece of his campaign, proposing to invest $2tn in a massive green jobs program to build renewable energy infrastructure, his ideas are not exactly radical. The money would be used for improving energy efficiency, constructing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, and increasing renewable energy from wind, solar and other technologies. Biden wants to end the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035, and to bring America to net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by no later than 2050. His goals may be too modest. If what is now occurring in the west is any indication, 2050 will be too late. Nonetheless, Americans have a clear choice. In a few weeks, when they decide whether Trump deserves another four years, climate change will be on the ballot. The choice shouldn’t be hard to make. Like the coronavirus, the dire consequences of climate change – coupled with Trump’s utter malfeasance – offer unambiguous proof that he couldn’t care less about the public good. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good. His new book, The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It, is out now. He is a columnist for Guardian US"

Guest Essay by Kip Hansen
 
Carl Zimmer of the New York Times gives us this story:  DNA Study Reveals the One and Only Wolf Species in North America.
“The first large study of North American wolf genomes has found that there is only one species on the continent: the gray wolf. Two other purported species, the Eastern wolf and the red wolf, are mixes of gray wolf and coyote DNA, the scientists behind the study concluded.
The finding, announced Wednesday, highlights the shortcomings of laws intended to protect endangered species, as such laws lag far behind scientific research into the evolution of species.”
Bridgett M. vonHoldt of Princeton University  who  studies the genome of the canids (mammals of the dog family – Canidae) – that is domestic and wild dogs, wolves, foxes, jackals and dingoes —  in her most recent study, highlighted by Zimmer, concludes that all North American wolves are genetically one species with variants, like the Eastern Wolf and the Red Wolf, being hybrids between Grey Wolves (Canis lupus) and the Coyote (Canis latrans).
Interesting, but so what?
Two months ago, in the same newspaper, Joanna Klein, writing in the science section’s Trilobites series, gave us:  Red Wolves Need Emergency Protection, Conservationists Say.
“Conservation groups submitted an emergency petition last week requesting that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service increase protection for the only wild population of red wolves left in the world.
 Red wolves, which are bigger than coyotes, but smaller than gray wolves, are the only wolf species found completely within the United States.”
….
“It also seeks an upgrading of the status of red wolves, which are endangered, from “nonessential” to “essential.” The change in status would grant reserved habitat to the species and require consultations with biologists over how changes to land use would affect the wolves.”
At the end of May, conservationists were lobbying the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service to declare the Red Wolf an “essential” species, in part because the “North Carolina’s Wildlife Resources Commission, a state-run conservation agency funded in part by the sale of hunting and fishing licenses, which has called the [federal Red Wolf Recovery Program] a failure and claimed that wolves have damaged private land.”  The details of the program themselves are a matter of controversy and conflict between state and federal biologists.
Carl Zimmer reports that “The gray wolf and red wolf were listed as endangered in the lower 48 states under the Endangered Species Act in the 1970s and remain protected today, to the periodic consternation of ranchers and agricultural interests.  In 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recognized the Eastern wolf as a separate species, which led officials to recommend delisting the gray wolf. Conservationists won a lawsuit that forced the agency to abandon the plan.”
Furthermore, vanHoldt’s study not only identifies the three canids (Grey, Eastern and Red wolves) as a single species (albeit, the latter two are wolf-coyote hybrids), but her paper states bluntly:
“The red wolf was listed as an endangered species in 1973, initiating a captive breeding program by the USFWS. The program began with 12 of 14 founding individuals that reproduced, selected from a panel of several hundred captured individuals that were thought to represent the ancestry spectrum ranging from coyote to pure red wolf and various admixtures of the two forms. These 12 founders were considered to be pure red wolves based on phenotypic characteristics and the lack of segregation of “coyote-like” traits in their offspring. The descendants of these founders defined the ancestry of the several hundred red wolves produced by the captive breeding program and have been the source for a single reintroduced population in eastern North Carolina.”
 The sad fact is that not only is the Red Wolf known to be a hybrid of the Grey Wolf and the Coyote, and has always been since it was first identified and studied, believed to have originated in the last century, but the Red Wolves of North Carolina are a human created species, created in an intentional federally financed breeding program, similar to the creating and breeding of dog breeds.   Well intended but hardly the purpose of the Endangered Species Act
vanHoldt and her team use their study to encourage the extension of the Endangered Species Act to cover such hybrids.
Why write of this little biologists’ tiff here?
To me, it demonstrates how far astray science and the science/policy interface can drift when the science itself is vague, blurry —  based on words and concepts that do not have solid, agreed-upon definitions that are based on solid science understandings.
The word in this story is SPECIES.  If you think that there is one and only one common and agreed upon definition of the word species in the world of biology, you have been criminally under-educated or remain willfully misinformed.  For a brief glimpse of the controversy, you can look at the entirely unauthoritative Species Problem wiki page, which states “there are at least 26 recognized species concepts.”
Several years ago, I personally attempted to discover the “current definition” of species being used by academic biologists.  I had foolishly believed that they must have one, by this time, 40 years after my university education.  My search finally ended when I had a protracted email conversation with a well-respected, well placed academic biologist, whom I had approached based on my digging deep into some journal article of his.  We had quite an extensive discussion only to arrive at his admission that “biology, as a subject, does not have a firm definition of species – never has – and may never have.”
This lack of a firm, scientifically-based definition makes the application science-related policies, enshrined as law, such as the Endangered Species Act – which can have far-reaching social and economic effects on civil society – problematic at best and, worse,  subject to “science fads” and whimsy.
# # # # #
Author’s Comment Policy:  
As always, I will be glad to answer your questions about my experience with the definition of the word species.
This essay is a simple comment on the implications of science and science-based-policy that depend on vague definitions and the trouble it can cause.
Disclosure:  I once owned a German Shepard/Wolf cross who was a sweet thing but had the unfortunate habit of playing too rough with my four small children – she would race alongside of them, leap up, take them in her teeth by the backs of their necks, and throw them to the ground, place her fore-paws on their chests and woof:  “I win!”.     I placed her with an ex-soldier who worked with dogs.

The long‐​term outlook for the stock market is not good, and here is why. For the past 100 years, there has been an inverse relationship between changes in the size of government and the growth or decline in the stock market. 



Even though the relative size of the U.S. federal government will decrease from 2009 to 2010, the trend is likely to be steadily upward from thereon, unless some fundamental changes are made. 



From 1910 until 1916, the size of the U.S. government remained almost constant as a share of gross domestic product. But with the entry of the U.S. into World War I, the size of government increased about tenfold from 1916 through 1919. The price level doubled (even though the Federal Reserve had been created in 1913 with an explicit charge to provide stable money) and the value of the stock market was cut in half. 



At the end of World War I, Congress sharply reduced spending but still left the country with a government about three times the size it was before the war. The country suffered a severe recession in 1920 and 1921 as the Fed reined in its inflationary monetary policy, which ultimately provided price stability from 1921 to 1929. The size of government was slowly reduced during the 1920s but still remained at about 50 percent higher than the pre‐​World War I level at the end of the decade. The stock market boomed but, even so, did not recover to its 1909 level (in inflation adjusted dollars) until 1928. 



With the onset of the Great Depression, government spending rose fairly steadily from about 4 percent of GDP at the end of 1929 to 11 percent by 1936, and ultimately to a high of 48 percent at the end of World War II. Despite some ups and downs, the stock market was about half its 1929 level and was not to reach that level again in real dollars until 1956. 



Government spending as a percentage of GDP went through wild gyrations from 1945 until 1953, at first because of a rapid demobilization from World War II, and then a more modest buildup to fund the Korean War. Even so, the size of government dropped by more than half from the beginning to the end of this period, and the markets rose by about 30 percent. 



The period from the end of the Korean War in 1953 to the beginning of the major buildup for the Vietnam War in 1965 was characterized by a continuing decline in the size of government, resulting in an almost threefold rise in the value of the market. 



Unfortunately, much of this market gain was lost during the next 17 years, as government grew larger under both Democrats and Republicans, until Ronald Reagan was finally able to obtain a reversal in the growth of government in 1982. From 1982 to 2001, the federal government slowly declined as a share of GDP (except during the brief recession of 1990–91), and the stock market rose by a record 579 percent. The good news came to an end in 2001 as the government started growing again, first under the Republicans and then the Democrats. The result was a major drop (after adjusting for inflation) from the stock market highs of 2000 to the present. 



In the past 18 months, there has been a huge bump in the government share of GDP (from about 21 percent to 28 percent). Much of the increase was due to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP financial rescue package) and the various “stimulus” packages. Much of the TARP money may well be paid back, and the stimulus spending surge should wind down in 2010. This should result in a small decline in the relative size of government, which partially explains the rise in the markets in recent months. 



But now, hold on. Congress is trying to add trillions of dollars of new spending for health care, climate change and assorted other schemes. To the extent Congress succeeds in passing such legislation, the relative size of government will steadily grow, which means there is a very high probability the stock market will decline in real terms over the coming years (there is a century of evidence). 



And finally, Congress and the administration continue to provide government guarantees (through the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) for most housing loans. Those loans that go bad, as many will, translate into hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government spending. 



Congress is the Grinch that is stealing your financial future. Happy New Year!

"**An underwater data cable, linking the US to Hong Kong, looks set to be rejected by the US government because of fears of Chinese data theft.**
The Pacific Light Cable Network, backed by Google and Facebook, is designed to boost internet speed and capacity.
But a US government committee known as ""Team Telecom"" has now recommended that the US denies it approval.
The decision is another sign of the growing tension between the US and China, who are in a trade war.
It would reportedly be the first such cable rejected by the US on national security grounds.
Around the world, there are hundreds of undersea cables providing internet connectivity.
The new cable was announced in 2016 as a partnership between Google, Facebook, and other companies.
Google said the cable would be 12,800 km long (8,000 miles) and would be the ""highest-capacity trans-Pacific route"".
""In other words, [the cable] will provide enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles,"" the company said.
The project would also have portions connecting the US with Taiwan and the Philippines.
The cable has been laid, reportedly at a cost of ""many millions of dollars"", but needs approval to operate.
One of the companies working with Facebook and Google is the Dr Peng group, a Chinese broadband giant.
The committee has recommended approval for the Taiwan and Philippines sections.
But on Wednesday, it recommended the US to Hong Kong section was denied ""on national security grounds"".
Their reasons included:
The final decision will be taken by the US Federal Communications Commission.
After President Trump took office, the US imposed billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on Chinese goods, with China retaliating.
Mr Trump had long accused China of unfair trading and intellectual property theft.
The US has also targeted Chinese technology firm Huawei, calling it a national security threat, and is taking a more aggressive stance on Hong Kong.
China is trying to introduce a security law in Hong Kong, which is a special administrative region of China. But the US, and others, say the law would threaten the city's autonomy.
Mr Trump said he would remove Hong Kong's privileged status in US law.
""China has replaced one country, two systems, with one country, one system,"" he said in May."

The best way to garner headlines in the global warming game is to generate scary scenarios. While many people view climate change as some esoteric concern of environmentalists, they still raise their eyebrows when they hear a phrase like “global warming deaths.”



It’s little surprise then that a recent article in _Nature_ magazine has caught so much attention. Written by Jonathan Patz, an associate professor of environmental studies and population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin, and three of his colleagues, it is a selective culling of the scientific literature — some recent, some not — on climate change and possible health impacts across the planet. The article’s claim: global warming kills 150,000 people each year.



Patz begins with the 2003 heat wave in Europe. First, it is not possible that any heat wave was caused by global warming, despite some climate modeling efforts that, according to Patz, demonstrates “a causal link.” It is impossible, and in fact is irresponsible, for any climatologist to claim that any given weather event could not have happened if not for increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases. Yes, 2003 was a very warm summer in Europe, but the fact that similar conditions occurred there in the very distant past pretty much debunks the “global warming” hypothesis.



The more relevant question is why so many Europeans died in August 2003. Here culture conspires with climate. The month‐​long August vacation is a cherished European tradition. It’s not unusual then for many countries to effectively shut down while the epicenter of the population shifts southward to Mediterranean beaches. This includes a reduction in medical staffing, less oversight of one’s elderly parents, etc. The French government caught flak for the high death toll, and rightly so. Undoubtedly the same weather conditions in July would have produced substantially fewer deaths. But the cultural factor is never mentioned in Patz’s global warming hook.



The “theory” that leads to such sloppy thinking about heat waves is that climate will be more variable with global warming. While the jury is still out on this, there is plenty of evidence in the United States that the opposite is true. In an extensive series of studies by Indiana University’s Scott Robeson, he found that in U.S. cities where warming had taken place, most of the cities exhibited less temperature variability, not more. Regrettably, these and other key papers were not part of Patz’ review.



Patz continues by talking about impacts that urban “heat islands” — the heat trapping effects of buildings and paved surfaces combined with less vegetation — result in most large cities being significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside. He is correct. In fact, the urbanization effect exceeds the background rate of global warming significantly, in some cases by an order of magnitude or more. If this is a problem, however, we should expect people living in cities to be dying in droves from heat exposure.



The graph below shows the aggregate heat‐​related death rate toll for 28 of the largest U.S. cities from 1964–1998. There is a statistically significant decline in heat‐​related mortality over the period. During the same time, temperature increased by an average of almost 1°C, partly and probably mostly, due to heat island effects. So why aren’t more people, instead of less people, dying from heat exposure, as postulated by Patz? 



  
Figure 1. Annual population‐​adjusted heat‐​related mortality averaged across 28 major U.S. cities. Each bar represents a different decade, beginning in the mid‐​1960s and ending in the late 1980s. Heat‐​related mortality has been steadily declining (adapted from Davis et al., 2003). 



It’s simple. People, by and large, are not stupid. If it’s too hot, they go into air conditioning. If it’s too cold, they turn up the heat, go into the sun, put on a jacket, etc. The fact that Phoenix has a thriving population in a valley that is essentially inhospitable to human life speaks volumes for the adaptability of humans to overcome the limitation imposed by nature. In fact, most elderly people move to Phoenix or Miami thinking they might prolong their lives by living away from harsh winter weather — not so they could die sooner. But global warming scaremongers depend upon the “stupid people” hypothesis to generate high mortality figures.



Later in the review, the authors discuss the potential health impacts of El Niño across the globe: epidemics of malaria and Rift Valley fever, Dengue hemorrhagic fever in Thailand, Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Desert Southwest, waterborne diseases in Peru, cholera in Bangladesh, etc. One teensy problem: El Niño is not related to global warming. The author admits this (sort of). He writes, “Although it is not clear whether and how [El Niño] dynamics will change in a warmer world, regions that are currently strongly affected by ENSO [another name for El Niño]…could experience heightened risks if ENSO variability, or the strength of events intensifies.” Sure. An equally likely scenario is that the impact of all of these diseases will be reduced if global warming generates fewer and weaker El Niños. But this was not discussed. It is not scientifically rigorous to write a paper about global warming impacts and to spend pages talking about impacts from something that is unrelated to global warming. 



Finally, Patz refers to a three‐​year old World Health Organization study, suggesting that climate changes that have occurred in the last 30 years could have caused 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. However, rough calculations using current global population and mortality rate estimates show that “global warming” is responsible for 0.2 percent of all deaths. This is a remarkably small number based upon WHO estimates that are undoubtedly an exaggeration in the first place. Another way to look at this is that during the last century, primarily as a result of technologies developed in a world powered by fossil fuels (the emissions from burning them are the presumed culprit behind the 150,000 annual deaths), average human expectancy in the developed democracies roughly doubled. Posit that two billion people lived in these areas in the 20th century, doubling their life expectancy is the equivalent of saving a billion lives. While one could quibble about the specifics, it is clear that fossil fuels have been responsible for longer lives, not shorter ones.



The most interesting aspect of the _Nature_ article is that Patz, whose primary expertise is in vector‐​borne diseases like malaria, has the least confidence about the global warming‐​malaria link. His discussions and review of the vector‐​borne disease literature is fairly balanced and contains many of the key caveats. Unfortunately, this balanced tone does not permeate most of the report.



There is no doubt that climate change will have some impacts, both positive and negative, on global health. One could just as easily write a review about how a warming planet is producing myriad health benefits. It would not be published in _Nature_ magazine, however, and rightly so, because it would not represent a fair, accurate, and thorough overview of the scientific literature. But, after reading the Patz review, it’s clear that this standard of objectivity is selectively applied.

CO2 Has Risen By 110 ppm Since 1750
 The Human Contribution Is Just 17 ppm 



Harde, 2017
Abstract:
Climate scientists presume that the carbon cycle has come out of balance due to the increasing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change. This is made responsible for the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over recent years, and it is estimated that the removal of the additional emissions from the atmosphere will take a few hundred thousand years. Since this goes along with an increasing greenhouse effect and a further global warming, a better understanding of the carbon cycle is of great importance for all future climate change predictions. We have critically scrutinized this cycle and present an alternative concept, for which the uptake of CO2 by natural sinks scales proportional with the CO2 concentration. In addition, we consider temperature dependent natural emission and absorption rates, by which the paleoclimatic CO2 variations and the actual CO2 growth rate can well be explained. The anthropogenic contribution to the actual CO2 concentration is found to be 4.3%, its fraction to the CO2 increase over the Industrial Era is 15% and the average residence time 4 years.

Conclusion:
Climate scientists assume that a disturbed carbon cycle, which has come out of balance by the increasing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change, is responsible for the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over recent years. While over the whole Holocene up to the entrance of the Industrial Era (1750) natural emissions by heterotrophic processes and fire were supposed to be in equilibrium with the uptake by photosynthesis and the net oceanatmosphere gas exchange, with the onset of the Industrial Era the IPCC estimates that about 15 – 40 % of the additional emissions cannot further be absorbed by the natural sinks and are accumulating in the atmosphere. 
The IPCC further argues that CO2 emitted until 2100 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1000 years, and in the same context it is even mentioned that the removal of human-emitted CO2 from the atmosphere by natural processes will take a few hundred thousand years (high confidence) (see AR5-Chap.6-Executive-Summary). 
Since the rising CO2 concentrations go along with an increasing greenhouse effect and, thus, a further global warming, a better understanding of the carbon cycle is a necessary prerequisite for all future climate change predictions. In their accounting schemes and models of the carbon cycle the IPCC uses many new and detailed data which are primarily focussing on fossil fuel emission, cement fabrication or net land use change (see AR5-WG1-Chap.6.3.2), but it largely neglects any changes of the natural emissions, which contribute to more than 95 % to the total emissions and by far cannot be assumed to be constant over longer periods (see, e.g.: variations over the last 800,000 years (Jouzel et al., 2007); the last glacial termination (Monnin et al., 2001); or the younger Holocene (Monnin et al., 2004; Wagner et al., 2004)).

Since our own estimates of the average CO2 residence time in the atmosphere differ by several orders of magnitude from the announced IPCC values, and on the other hand actual investigations of Humlum et al. (2013) or Salby (2013, 2016) show a strong relation between the natural CO2 emission rate and the surface temperature, this was motivation enough to scrutinize the IPCC accounting scheme in more detail and to contrast this to our own calculations. 
Different to the IPCC we start with a rate equation for the emission and absorption processes, where the uptake is not assumed to be saturated but scales proportional with the actual CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (see also Essenhigh, 2009; Salby, 2016). This is justified by the observation of an exponential decay of 14C. A fractional saturation, as assumed by the IPCC, can directly be expressed by a larger residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere and makes a distinction between a turnover time and adjustment time needless. Based on this approach and as solution of the rate equation we derive a concentration at steady state, which is only determined by the product of the total emission rate and the residence time. Under present conditions the natural emissions contribute 373 ppm and anthropogenic emissions 17 ppm to the total concentration of 390 ppm (2012). For the average residence time we only find 4 years. 
The stronger increase of the concentration over the Industrial Era up to present times can be explained by introducing a temperature dependent natural emission rate as well as a temperature affected residence time. With this approach not only the exponential increase with the onset of the Industrial Era but also the concentrations at glacial and cooler interglacial times can well be reproduced in full agreement with all observations. So, different to the IPCC’s interpretation the steep increase of the concentration since 1850 finds its natural explanation in the self accelerating processes on the one hand by stronger degassing of the oceans as well as a faster plant growth and decomposition, on the other hand by an increasing residence time at reduced solubility of CO2 in oceans. 
Together this results in a dominating temperature controlled natural gain, which contributes about 85 % to the 110 ppm CO2 increase over the Industrial Era, whereas the actual anthropogenic emissions of 4.3 % only donate 15 %. These results indicate that almost all of the observed change of CO2 during the Industrial Era followed, not from anthropogenic emission, but from changes of natural emission. 

The results are consistent with the observed lag of CO2 changes behind temperature changes (Humlum et al., 2013; Salby, 2013), a signature of cause and effect. Our analysis of the carbon cycle, which exclusively uses data for the CO2 concentrations and fluxes as published in AR5, shows that also a completely different interpretation of these data is possible, this in complete conformity with all observations and natural causalities.

"London’s sewerage system is one of the wonders of the industrial world, and a prize example of great Victorian feats of engineering. The system was designed by the visionary Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works - Sir Joseph Bazalgette - in 1856, but languished unfunded, until the Great Stink of 1858. The miasma theory popular at the time held that “bad air” spread disease, and in this case the smell was so bad that Members of Parliament, fearing for their lives, finally focused on tackling the project. Bazalgette’s original sewer system was designed for a population of four million people - to accommodate for the growth of what was already the world’s largest city at two and a half million citizens. The design also accommodated for rainfall of up 6.5mm per day and was – at a staggering cost of £4.2 million - the world’s most sophisticated system. The same system, using today’s high technology construction systems would cost about £60m. Until London’s sewers were built, tens of thousands of people were killed by frequent outbreaks of cholera. During the middle of the 19th century, 40,000 people died due to an outbreak of this disease. Sanitation such as Bazalgette’s London sewers is not just about dealing with dirty water - it has made an immense contribution to the health and well-being of Londoners, and saved many millions of lives where implemented worldwide. To this day, London relies on this original system, but the city’s population of more than eight million today is twice its designed capacity. Adding to complications is that much of the permeable surface that could have helped absorb and slow run-off water has disappeared under the ever expanding concrete and tarmac. Today, even light rainfall of 2mm can trigger a discharge of sewage into the Thames, polluting the water. Following a decade of study and evaluation of various options, the Thames Tideway Tunnel project has been proposed. This is the first significant change to the capital’s 150-year-old sanitation system, and is designed to prevent the current rates of around 39m cubic metres of untreated sewage discharged into the river every year. The Thames Tideway scheme is built around the main tunnel, 7.2m in diameter and 16 miles long, that will run mostly under the River Thames between about 30 and 70 metres below ground level. It also includes the new Lee Tunnel, and upgraded sewage treatment facilities, which are already in progress. Once completed in 2023, the main tunnel will reduce the need for sewage discharge and will reduce rainwater to under three million cubic metres – considerably reducing the risk to public health and the environment in the river itself.  The cost of this project is, at £4.2 billion, a thousand times more expensive than its predecessor, and almost half the cost of the 2012 London Olympics. This is a significant sum of money in these hard-pressed economic times. But it’s likely the alternatives will cost significantly more and some may not be feasible in a city as densely populated as London. Other large cities with very long histories, such as Paris, face the same challenge. A solution similar to the proposed tunnel in London is being considered. An increasingly common approach is to construct separate drainage systems for sewage and rain water. This system reduces the pressure on drainage infrastructure and allows for savings on sewage treatment costs and reuse of rainwater. However, retrofitting dual drainage systems in cities the size and complexity as London is prohibitively expensive and impractical. The other alternatives include Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS), which use measures to minimise the amount of rainwater that enters the sewage system. For example, grassed “living” roofs absorb water, or soakaways in the ground. But these require large areas of land and without a major disruption to the city and its economy, these simply cannot be implemented. They also take much longer, as they rely in part on natural processes. Another approach is to build distributed shallow rain water drains connecting to an underground storage tank. The collected rain water can be treated and reused or - if this is uneconomical - released into the main sewage system at a controlled rate. This would avoid the need to release raw sewage into the Thames. But again, this solution is likely to prove expensive and difficult to implement in the densely-built city centre, but offers an alternative to less densely populated areas of Greater London. Thames Tideway Tunnel is a traditional engineering solution to accumulated problems over the last 150 years. It does not propose any innovations to dealing with the problem. But if steps are not taken to improve London’s sewers, it’s very likely the combined overflow into the Thames will to continue to rise, perhaps as high as 70 million cubic meters. This would seriously damage the river water quality, and potentially pose a public health risk. While the Thames Tideway Tunnel is not necessarily the ideal answer to London’s rising tide of sewage, it is currently the best, practicable solution on the table."
"WASHINGTON  —   Senate Republicans will move this week to speed the confirmation of President Trump’s cabinet, an effort that has been stymied by the combination of lax preparation by Mr. Trump’s transition team, his many unorthodox nominees and Democrats spoiling for a fight, albeit with few cards in their deck. On Monday, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, after Democrats used one of the few procedural maneuvers left to them to force a debate on his inevitable approval. Republicans had hoped to push through Mr. Pompeo and others last Friday, but were able to confirm only two: James N. Mattis for defense secretary and John F. Kelly to lead homeland security. President Obama had seven nominees approved on his first day in office. Also on Monday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, whose road to confirmation has been bumpy. Mr. Tillerson received a lift on Sunday when two Republicans, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they would support him, after weeks of public hedging. Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has drawn scrutiny over his business connections with Russia and his personal relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, has hinted that he might join Democrats in rejecting Mr. Tillerson, which would lead to the unusual spectacle of a nominee facing the full Senate without a positive recommendation from the committee that held his confirmation hearing. Other nominees have been impeded by attempts to untangle their conflicts of interest, a process that Mr. Trump’s transition team started far later than its predecessors and that has led to embarrassing revelations. A committee vote for Betsy DeVos, a billionaire who is Mr. Trump’s nominee for education secretary, has been delayed by a week to give senators more time to review her voluminous ethics paperwork, which was released after her hearing last week. Other nominees have been delayed for similar reasons. Last week, Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, Mr. Trump’s choice for White House budget director, disclosed that he had failed to pay more than $15, 000 in payroll taxes for a household employee. Steven T. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump’s Treasury secretary nominee, failed to list nearly $100 million in assets on his federal disclosure forms, an oversight that gave Democrats a club with which to beat on him in his Finance Committee hearing last week. “Advise and consent doesn’t mean ram it through,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “If I were the Republicans, of course I’d want to ram a cabinet like this through. ” Whether these mistakes will thwart the eventual confirmation of any nominee remains in doubt. For all the intraparty rancor and “ ” during the campaign, Republicans appear to have closed ranks on Capitol Hill to protect their unusual president and his cabinet choices, for now. They have, when possible, prevented Democrats from grilling the nominees too hard, as was the case with Ms. DeVos, when Republicans shut down the hearing after one round of questions from eager lawmakers. Ms. DeVos had been struggling through a series of befuddling answers that raised questions about her grasp of federal education policy, including one flourish  —   replayed widely on social media and cable television  —   in which she suggested that school officials should be armed to protect against prospective grizzly bears on the premises. In other cases, Republicans have rushed to the defense of nominees under fire, as when Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, suggested during Mr. Mnuchin’s hearing that Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, needed to take a Valium. For their part, Democrats showed the frustration that is likely to surface repeatedly now that they have lost the White House and do not have the filibuster available to them. But their approach in confirmation hearings, raw and blunt after a bitter election defeat, probably presages the tactics that lawmakers are already learning in the Trump era  —   and the defensive maneuvers Republicans will employ. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, excoriated the civil rights record of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general, breaking with a   Senate custom of comity in the chamber. Democrats lobbed hours of questions at Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee for secretary of health and human services, about his trading of stocks in health care companies that may have benefited from his legislating, keeping Mr. Price on the defensive heading into another confirmation hearing this week. “I’ve noticed that the questioning frequently has an edge to it,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. “That is not to say that there aren’t legitimate questions to be asked of the nominees. But it’s the way they’re asked that I’ve found to be different this time. ” The Senate typically confirms nearly all of a president’s cabinet, and many Democrats, if not most, will vote for the bulk of Mr. Trump’s nominees. Democrats changed Senate rules when they were in power to make cabinet nominees subject to a mere majority  —   rather than 60  —   vote threshold, empowering Mr. Trump to send up more conservative and unusual choices. Their numbers limited, Democrats have opted to put Republicans on the defensive as much as possible. Mr. Booker’s decision to testify against a fellow senator particularly rankled opponents, who accused him of grandstanding. In other moments, Republicans have chafed more at Democrats’ tone than at the content of their remarks. Democrats are eager to argue the irony of any complaints about partisanship and obstructionism. Many remain bitter over Republicans’ blockade of Merrick B. Garland, Mr. Obama’s choice for the Supreme Court in his final year in office. “The Republican majority in the United States Senate refused a hearing and a vote on a nominee to fill a vacancy in the U. S. Supreme Court,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, chastised Democrats for refusing to consent to a speedy confirmation of nominees on Friday. “That position on the highest court in the land remained vacant because of the specific political strategy of the Republican leader on the other side. ” Others have pointed to the relentless inquiries into Hillary Clinton and the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, wondering aloud why only a single round of questions was allowed in hearings for Ms. DeVos and Mr. Price. After going over his allotted time questioning Mr. Price, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, grumbled that he would cede time in the nonexistent second round. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was not amused. He later noted that Mr. Price had been questioned more than any nominee to the post in more than two decades. “You may be here by yourself,” Mr. Alexander told Mr. Franken. “The Benghazi hearing was 11 hours,” Mr. Franken shot back. “That’s all I’m saying. ” Paul C. Light, a professor of public service at New York University who has worked on Capitol Hill as an adviser on transitions, said the confirmation process had made clear that standards for acceptable nominee conduct have changed. “There doesn’t seem to be any controversy about things that used to be controversial,” he said. “We’ve lowered the bar in terms of offenses that would have taken out nominees. ”"
"Senator Bob Brown insists all coal driven power stations should be closed by 2020.
I would suggest that the public be given an opportunity to see what it is like to be without those power stations, say for one day a week, every week, for say, a year.
As power stations cannot be switched on and off like lights in a home, it will be cheaper and better for the operators to simply cut off the power for 24 hours once a week.
Power stations will be compensated for their financial losses by the Greens, the Labor party and those true believers in the Liberal party.
This will give the public some basis on which to make judgments.
When the power goes off, there will be:
* No trains.
* No airline operations.
* No shops open.
* No food available.
* No coffee shops.
* No paper shop.
* No radio and or television transmission.
* No air conditioning.
* No electric blankets in winter.
* No refrigeration.
* No washing machines.
* No electrical appliance systems at all.
* No  electronic communications systems.
* No sporting events.
* No 000 calls.
* No ambulance.
* No Fire Brigade.
* No medical operations.
*  No X-rays.
I have been wondering whether the public would stand this for a year; especially over a non-existent problem. If Senator Brown gets his way they will have to endure it for ever.
Apart from hydro power, coal driven power is still the cheapest source of reliable power on earth.

"Solar and wind power rightly receive a lot of attention as we struggle to ramp up renewable electricity and move away from fossil fuels. But in a damp, blustery island such as ours, generating heat is as much a priority as electricity. This is especially the case in fuel poor homes where affordable warmth (as opposed to fewer carbon emissions) is the pressing priority. In this case, district heating systems can play an important role in making heat cheaper, while also reducing carbon emissions. The importance of renewable heat has been recognised in the Climate Change Act (Scotland), which requires 11% of Scotland’s heat to come from renewable sources by 2020. However, as of last year it’s estimated that less than 3% of demand for heat not being supplied by electricity is from renewables. There is an exciting renewable resource right under our feet that lends itself well to district-level heating solutions, however: warm water lying in abandoned mine workings, which varies between 11°C and 14°C. There is a vast network of abandoned pits in the former mining areas across Britain where coal and ironstone were extracted. Many of these seams are found very close to the surface, extending down to a few hundred metres, which makes the water now occupying these voids relatively accessible. The geology is such that many of these coal seams, and therefore the mine workings, are interconnected through faults and layers of permeable rock. This means that in many cases the water can move freely and could be considered as one large, albeit rather complex, reservoir. For this reason the thermal energy stored in the mine water should be considered a truly renewable energy sources, since any water extracted from a mine will be recharged by water percolating through from the surroundings. The heat stored in these waters is vast.  In Glasgow alone the stored heat is in excess of 2,000 GWh per square kilometre. While the temperature of the water might appear low, modern heat pump technologies are at such efficiencies that even a few degree difference between the air and water temperatures is adequate to harvest the heat.  This would therefore means that the mineworkings below Glasgow are able to heat more than 80,000 homes per square kilometre.  British Geological Survey (BGS) scientists have interpreted more than 50,000 borehole records from the Glasgow area and records of abandoned mines dating back to 1839.  These have been brought together with data from other sources to create detailed 3D geological models, enabling researchers to predict the geology and depth of mines anywhere below the city’s centre. Using mine water to provide heating has been demonstrated already, in two housing association estates in Glasgow and Fife, in Scotland. These projects have run for over ten years, providing reliable heating to residents for a very low cost.  For example, the average heating costs in Shettleston, Glasgow which uses heat from mineworkings is £150 per year plus £10/month for maintenance, compared to the national average of £800-1000 per year for gas heating. These systems can be very easily reversed to provide cooling if required.  Given its moderate levels of temperature (11-14°C) the water could be directly pumped into buildings as chilled water for air conditioning.  Scotland’s temperate climate may not require it often, but large buildings such as universities, hospitals and offices require cooling year round due to the heat given off from running lots of electrical equipment and extensive lighting throughout. Research at the Glasgow Caledonian University is focusing on how to exploit this significant heat resource. The aim is to create a resource map that outlines potential hotspots for development that would be appropriate for mine water heating systems. This map will consider heat demand across the Glasgow, with the intention of mapping those who use lots of heat with potential nearby sources. The research will also analyse different heat pump and ground loop configurations and their relative suitability for residential, commercial, or light industrial sites. Monitoring the temperature and chemistry of mine water at a number of sites across Glasgow is another focus, with a view to providing insights to the general condition and characteristics of mine water in this area. To develop the business case, it will also consider the economic aspects to the installation and running costs, as well as length of time to recoup the investment and government incentives on offer. An separate but related initiative is to work with Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) to transform the water that enters Glasgow’s underground system into a sustainable heat source. Ultimately the aim of these projects is to raise awareness of this renewable heat resource and build confidence in the technology that could put it to use throughout the UK."

EU energy consumption fell only a measly 2.5% from 1990 to 2015, eurostat reports.
Also the share of fossil fuels in total energy consumption in the EU remains stubbornly high:

Despite committing an estimated 1 trillion euros in green energies, Europe remains intensively high with respect to fossil fuel consumption. Source: eurostat
For the money, Europe will contribute theoretically only a very few tenths of degree less warming to the global climate by the year 2100.
Though energy consumption in the EU is below its 1990 level, EU dependency on fossil fuel imports is on the rise:

In 2015, gross inland energy consumption, which reflects the energy quantities necessary to satisfy all inland consumption, amounted in the European Union (EU) to 1,626 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), below its 1990 level (-2.5%) and down by 11.6% compared to its peak of almost 1,840 Mtoe in 2006.
Accounting for nearly three-quarters of EU consumption of energy in 2015, fossil fuels continued to represent by far the main source of energy, although their weight has constantly decreased over the past decades, from 83% in 1990 to 73% in 2015. However, over this period, EU dependency on imports of fossils fuels has increased, with 73% imported in 2015 compared with just over half (53%) in 1990.
In other words, while in 1990 one tonne of fossil fuels was imported for each tonne produced in the EU, by 2015 three tonnes were imported for each tonne produced.

Source: eurostat.
Based on EU 2012 directives, EU renewable energy share is supposed to be at least 27% of the electric power production 2030. And according to an EU 2014 agreement, greenhouse gas emissions is supposed to be 40 percent less, a target that climate protection activists say is too little!
Though statistics showing considerable greenhouse gas reductions since 1990, the vast majority of it happened right after the shut down of the dilapidated, communist run industries in the first years after the fall of the Iron Curtain. There has been little progress since.

Undocumented migrants pouring into Europe. By SV – http://www.slovenskavojska.si/odnosi-z-javnostmi/sporocila-za-javnost/novica/nov/sodelovanje-slovenske-vojske-pri-podpori-policije-fotoreportaza-rigonce-dobova-brezice/, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=44418959
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
h/t DailyCaller – an article by Joe Romm on Think Progress (formerly Climate Progress) claims global warming triggered the “political tipping point” which led to Brexit and the rise of Trump.
Recent events, especially Trumpism and Brexit, are omens of the disunity we face. Trump’s campaign is driven by racist statements and wildly impractical plans to wall off the country literally and figuratively from various ethnic and religious groups.
The Syrian migrant crisis “had an outsized impact on the Brexit,” as NBC News political director Chuck Todd said Friday. You can see that in the pro-Brexit poster from the U.K. Independence Party (above) — which became a major advertising campaign of the referendum — featuring thousands of male refugees streaming from Croatia into Slovenia last October.
It bears repeating that a major 2015 study confirmed: “Human-caused climate change was a major trigger of Syria’s brutal civil war.” This study found that global warming made Syria’s 2006 to 2010 drought two to three times more likely. “While we’re not saying the drought caused the war,” the lead author explained. “We are saying that it certainly contributed to other factors — agricultural collapse and mass migration among them — that caused the uprising.”
And that mass migration ultimately fueled the mass refugee crisis of the last two years, a crisis the world has utterly failed to figure out how to handle.

There are a few problems with this narrative.
For starters, the evidence that the Syrian Civil War has anything to do with climate is tenuous at best. Even the über green Guardian has criticised attempts to link the Syrian Civil War to Climate.
The refugee “crisis” is an almost entirely engineered problem. The countries which have the worst “refugee” problems are countries whose leaders deliberately laid out the welcome mat. In Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel virtually guaranteed undocumented immigrants who made it to Europe would receive residency. In America, President Obama granted mass amnesty to undocumented immigrants, encouraging unprecedented numbers of poor people to entrust their families to international criminals.
Contrast those disruptive refugee experiences to Australia, which broke the credibility of people smugglers by turning back the boats, and successfully slowed the flow of mostly economic undocumented migrants to a trickle.
The world is a complex place. Trying to explain the decline of liberal politics, in terms of how much CO2 is in the air, is simply nuts.

"Recently a newspaper asked its readers to propose species that were, ecologically speaking, “useless”, such that their loss would not have any great knock-on effect on other species or biological cycles. And what did they choose to illustrate this question with? A wasp - which, along with stinging nettles and dog dirt are pretty much the only appreciable natural hazards in the British Isles. Like many other species of the order Hymenoptera, these insects have modified ovipositors that no longer lay eggs but instead sting. While bees either make honey or look fluffy and bumbling, these black and yellow wasps seem to do nothing but ruin whatever weather passes for a British summer by pestering picnics and dive-bombing barbeques. Getting stung by a wasp is not a great deal of fun. For an unlucky few it can even be life-threatening if they experience an extreme immune system reaction to the venom and enter anaphylactic shock. In some regions some wasps are considered invasive species, which have in a relatively short period of time wrought havoc on native ecosystems. But I want to consider our attitudes to these species in their native habitats. I want us, in short, to love wasps - for two reasons. First, wasps are not useless but in fact very important elements in complex ecosystems. Adult wasps feed on nectar and sweet fruit (and possibly your unattended soft drink or beer as they will be attracted to its strong smell). By feeding on nectar, wasps are pollinating species. But it is the feeding requirements of their larvae that produce arguably more important ecological effects as their larvae only eat solid food. Consequently, a great deal of an adult wasp’s time is spent searching for species that we consider pests: aphids and caterpillars that eat the plants that we want to eat, or like to admire. To answer the question of what purpose wasps play, one could do much worse than consult Alfred Lotka’s ground breaking work on mathematical biology. Lotka captured some of the myriad interactions between species in a series of elegant equations and showed the complex ecosystem-level behaviour that could result. It would be practically impossible to predict the impact of the extinction of even a single species of wasp on the many other creatures and plants it interacts with, directly or indirectly. The second reason why we should love wasps I come to by way of analogy. I can only speculate what The Right Honorable Theresa May did on the evening of 7th July 2013 - perhaps enjoy a glass of wine with her feet up on a Home Office desk while savoring Abu Qatada’s final journey from the UK to Jordan. Qatada first came to the UK in 1994, and was convicted in absentia by a Jordanian court in 1999 for conspiracy to carry out terrorist attacks. Although never charged, he was imprisoned for periods in the UK under anti-terrorism laws in response to evidence that he had links to terrorists networks such as al-Qaeda. The British government started proceedings to deport Qatada to Jordan in 2002, and these continued in a torturous fashion for more than a decade through various court rulings and challenges to those rulings. He was a thorn in the side of successive Home Secretaries and a focal point for those that questioned the priorities and even sanity of the legal system. Estimates of the costs borne by the taxpayer range from £500,000 to £3m. Why should we care about Qatada’s legal rights? Why go to such trouble, time and expense to ensure that when he was deported it was done in strict accordance to the law? Because by respecting Qatada’s rights and according him due process we can be sure our rights will be respected too. Some of the rights we enjoy in the UK have been literally fought for. The moment you qualify them, judge their applicability in terms of how worthy their holders are, you undermine their entire basis. And so to wasps. They may be a nuisance, to some even life threatening. But if we value them and give them due process and consideration, then we should be in a much better position to consider the very large number of other species that we directly benefit from such as bees pollinating crops or trees stabilising slopes and reducing flooding.  Until recently, we have simply taken for granted that the other species we share the Earth’s biosphere with contribute greatly to our well being. In an important way, these hidden benefits are very much like rights - you only notice how vital they were after they are taken away."
"Over the past decade, many American cities have been transformed by young professionals of the millennial generation, with downtowns turning into bustling neighborhoods full of new apartments and pricey coffee bars. But soon, cities may start running out of millennials. A number of demographers, along with economists and real estate consultants, are starting to contemplate what urban cores will look like now that the generation  —   America’s largest  —   is cresting. Millennials are generally considered to be those born between the early 1980s and late 1990s or early 2000s, and many in this generation are aging from their 20s into the more traditionally suburban   years. There are already some signs that the inflow of young professionals into cities has reached its peak, and that the outflow of   couples to the suburbs has resumed after stalling during the Great Recession. Dowell Myers, a professor of demography and urban planning at the University of Southern California, recently published a paper that noted American cities reached “peak millennial” in 2015. Over the next few years, he predicts, the growth in demand for urban living is likely to stall. The flow of young professionals into Philadelphia has flattened, according to JLL Research, while apartment rents have started to soften in a number of big cities because of a glut of new construction geared toward urban newcomers who haven’t arrived. Apartment rents in San Francisco, Washington, Denver, Miami and New York are moderating or even declining from a year ago, according to Zillow. “Certainly the softening of rents is one sign that they are not coming in at the pace that people thought they would,” said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. The debate is full of contours and caveats, but it really boils down to this: Are large numbers of millennials really so enamored with city living that they will age and raise families inside the urban core, or will many of them, like earlier generations, eventually head to the suburbs in search of bigger homes and better school districts? Their choices  —   and it will be at least a few years before a definitive direction is clear  —   will have an impact on city budgets and gentrification fights. It could change the streetscape itself as businesses shift. It will affect billions of dollars’ worth of new apartments built on the premise that the flood of young people into cities would continue unabated. It could also have a big impact on the American landscape more generally. For the past   the trend toward suburbanization has continued with no real opposition. Even in the 1990s and 2000s, when urban areas were starting to turn around, subdivisions continued to expand. Have millennials ended that trend? Here’s one thing we know: People get older. Another is that people’s tolerance for   jobs and small urban apartments is highest when they are young adults. So while many things affect the increasing popularity of city living, including lower crime rates and a preference for walkable neighborhoods, one of the biggest factors is simply the number of people who are around 25. Right now, that number is as high as it has been in decades. Another big driver of urban demand, immigration (both documented and undocumented) has been roughly constant since 2000. That number could change with policy, but given the current political climate, immigration seems unlikely to go up. The last time the nation had a huge bubble of    was the late 1970s and early 1980s. Then, like now, an influx of people in their early 20s moved into cities. There were newspaper articles about young professionals gentrifying urban neighborhoods “Changing San Francisco Is Foreseen as a Haven for Wealthy and Childless,” a New York Times headline said in 1981. Each era has its economic challenges, and many millennials had the misfortune of entering adulthood during the Great Recession and its aftermath. The people at the tail end of Generation X, who came after the baby boomers, were born in the   years of the late 1970s and entered adulthood during the late 1990s financial boom. But the bulk of millennials came of age when jobs were scarce, Mr. Myers noted. They started moving into cities and apartments during years when rent was historically high. The number of young professionals was rising, adding to apartment demand, but supply was tight because new construction stalled during the recession. When city populations started swelling in the early and   it had less to do with the first of the millennials moving in than it did with lots of slightly older people not moving out, according to Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire. The presence of so many young college graduates upended many American cities. You can see it in the hordes of techies congregating on weekends at Dolores Park in San Francisco and in the battles over gentrification. It’s behind new demands for rent control and the artists who live in cheap but unsafe warehouses. In many cities, the high cost of living has galvanized a generation of young renters who have started to form a “YIMBY Party” that wants more apartment construction, and often pits younger renters against older homeowners. Now, however, the pressure is starting to ease. Apartment developers have responded with a boom in new construction. In 2013, the number of people moving into and out of cities started to balance out for the first time since the recession, largely because those in their 30s and 40s resumed their march to the suburbs, according to Mr. Johnson’s research. Some research also shows that, while millennials seem to prefer cities in their youth, the draw of the suburbs is still strong. The counterargument is some version of “this time is different. ” And millennials do seem to embrace cities more than their boomer parents did. They have shown up in greater concentrations, they bike more and drive less, and they have lingered in cities longer  —   possibly because they are still building a house down payment, delaying children longer or forgoing parenthood entirely. For these reasons and others, Joe Cortright, director of the City Observatory, an urban think tank in Portland, Ore. is predicting that cities will continue to swell with young people coming in and older people staying longer. The decline in births between millennials and the generation after them  —   often called Generation Z  —   is more like a slight grade than a cliff, so even as millennials age there will be a new, though smaller, supply of    coming behind them, he said. Still, if there is an economic lesson that the Great Recession has stamped upon many millennials, it’s that there is often a big difference between what you want and what you can afford. So while some    millennials might have made a declaration that they would rather die than live in a suburb, their    selves might feel differently, especially when they realize that suburban housing is often cheaper and suburban public schools are often better. “You can have all the preferences you want, but you have to live somewhere and you have to have a budget,” said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow. “Those are the cold hard truths you have to live with. ”"
"**China's ruling Communist Party has set in motion a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, a move seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms.**
The law to ban ""secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" could bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers.
Critics say Beijing is breaking its promise to allow Hong Kong freedoms not seen elsewhere in China.
Pro-democracy activists have called for mass protests against what they see erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.
Anger was already apparent on Friday, as a group of protesters descended on China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The draft law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year.
Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce security legislation after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997.
After last year's wave of sustained and violent protest, Beijing is now attempting to push them through, arguing ""law-based and forceful measures"" must be taken to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future.
On Friday, Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms.
The law has rattled financial markets, causing Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) to drop by more than 5% on Friday.
The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC.
It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial.
That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law.""
Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions.""
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city.
**Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent**
China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever.
But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland.
""Secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" are open to some interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting.
The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere.
China could essentially place the draft law into Annex III of the Basic Law, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree.
The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May.
It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June.
Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China.
It has observed a ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have.
Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms.
""This is the largest nuclear weapon the Chinese Communist Party has used in its mutual destruction of Hong Kong,"" Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist who played a leading role in last year's protests.
Last year's mass protests in Hong Kong were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
The bill was paused, then withdrawn - but the protests continued until the coronavirus outbreak at the end of the year.
The US has also weighed in, with President Trump saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details.
It is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges.
The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""following reports and monitoring the situation closely"".
""We expect China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the [Sino-British] Joint Declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong's autonomy and respecting the 'One Country, Two Systems' model,"" a statement said.
Mr Wang said the security risks had become ""increasingly notable"" - a reference to last year's protests.
""Considering Hong Kong's situation at present, efforts must be made at the state-level to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms,"" he is quoted as saying in state media.
Beijing may also fear September's elections to Hong Kong's legislature.
If last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could potentially be blocked.
In a separate development, a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill on Friday.
Hong Kong was under British control for more than 150 years up to 1997.
The British and Chinese governments signed a treaty - the Sino-British Joint Declaration - that agreed Hong Kong would have ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"", for 50 years.
Those freedoms, contained in the Basic Law, are only enshrined until 2047 and it is not clear what will happen then."
"When the Chinese authorities in Chengdu showed off their 14 giant panda cubs last week, it again raised questions about the role of panda breeding in zoos outside China, and whether it is a help or hindrance to their conservation in the wild. From one perspective this practice isn’t even about panda conservation, but is nowadays linked more to commerce and trade agreements between China and the countries concerned - so-called panda diplomacy. It’s also been suggested that some of the very large amounts of money needed to loan pandas from the Chinese government, money ostensibly used for panda conservation, may not in fact fund panda conservation at all. These were the sort of issues that brought researchers and zoologists and biologists (myself included) to a symposium at Edinburgh Zoo last month, to hear the current state-of-the-art in panda conservation, and to help the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland develop a research program to help pandas in the future, both in captivity and in the wild. Despite the fact that this is one of the most heavily researched endangered species in the world, the elusive nature and peculiar lifestyle of wild pandas mean there is still a lot to learn about China’s “bear-cat” (the literal translation of the Chinese name, 熊貓 or xióng māo). The symposium brought together some of China’s top panda experts, scientists and zoo curators from the US, UK and Germany, and researchers from Scotland who have been studying Edinburgh Zoo’s captive pair Tian Tian and Yang Guang since they arrived in 2011. So as the world has watched and waited (and waited) for news of whether Tian Tian will be the first captive panda to give birth in the UK, there were serious discussions about how the Society could use its resources to prevent the species going extinct in the wild. In the last two years, Chinese authorities have been conducting the 4th National Survey to attempt to document the remaining wild panda population. Estimated at around 1,600 in 2003, it may have increased following stringent protection measures and improvements in the way pandas are counted – including DNA profiling. One issue raised was need for better means of assessing the success or failure of efforts to reconnect the areas of panda habitat, areas that are divided by ever-expanding development by China’s human population. In fact pandas do not always stay in their bamboo forests as we might believe. In 2005 a female panda was found in the city of Dujiangyan, sitting in a tree next to a major road. Those who saw her were struck by her agility, speed and ability to evade capture: wild giant pandas are far from the sluggish chewing machines their captive relatives are sometimes portrayed as. If, as seems possible, panda populations are slowly rising, the challenge is how to enable them to move between patches of surviving habitat near human settlements, and how to monitor them when they disperse. Ultimately it will be connections between reserves that will enable the species to occupy more of its former range. But to create these corridors so that they are used, we need to know a lot more about how individual pandas use their existing habitat, and what forces them out into less familiar areas. The availability of old growth forest to provide secure and stable tree holes for females to give birth, and the correct balance of bacterial gut flora needed for this unusual bear to process its bamboo diet in all seasons are also important areas that need research. For captive breeding programs the challenge remains how, or even whether, it is possible to predict whether a male and female housed together will breed. Do male pandas whose genes come from the northern part of their natural range (Shaanxi province) fancy southern females from the south of Sichuan, for example? And while artificial insemination is already used to impregnate females (as is the case with Tian Tian), could other forms of reproductive technology be used for better breeding success? Or should we simply encourage pandas to mate naturally, as they do in some zoos? One thing seems clear, Edinburgh is committed to help panda conservation for the foreseeable future (their pandas are on loan for ten years), which is just as well because although Tian Tian’s hormone profiles look promising (I could tell you the details, but I would have to shoot you afterwards), a birth within the next few weeks is far from assured. And some zoos have waited almost a decade for the patter of tiny paws, with no success."
"As a farmer, I’m supposed to hate vegans and environmental activists, but that’s nonsense. Even when I don’t agree with everything they say, I share their wish to make the world a better place and their concern about the state it’s in today. In an age of increasingly apocalyptic news about the natural world, we are frequently warned that the things we are buying and eating are driving ecological collapse. Sensible and thoughtful people everywhere are asking the same question: what should I eat? It is a good question and an important one that speaks of a growing public awareness of our footprint on Earth and our wish to do less harm, individually and collectively. But as a farmer I know that that question masks another, far deeper one, that we must all ask ourselves: how should we farm?  Yes, that question is relevant to each of us, even if we don’t work on the land. What we choose to eat isn’t just a personal choice. The things we pick from the shelves as we shop (and how much we pay for them) add up to a world-shaping message that is broadcast across the fields and determines what farmers choose to grow and how they must do it. So let’s ask ourselves, and farmers, to produce food that makes ecological sense. The question “what should I eat?” is looking down the wrong end of the telescope. So, how should we farm? A sustainable and good farming landscape needs to do many things. It needs to feed us all affordably, to keep soil healthy, to provide micro-habitats such as hedgerows and field trees – and even protect what is left of precious habitats such as peat bogs, rivers, wetlands and woodland. If a farming landscape does all this well already, then it is perhaps enough for us to talk about it being “sustainable”. In practice, however, few places are like this, so we need to be way more ambitious. We need to ask for “regenerative” agriculture, which means boosting soil health and encouraging biodiversity by working with natural processes as we grow food. More often than not, this means using grazing animals in “mixed” farming systems. Livestock, if well managed, repair soil, trample or eat crop residues and waste, provide fertiliser and control weeds. It means our uplands becoming patchworks of native habitats – meadows and pastures, woodland and bogs – and our lowlands working as rotational mosaics of fields. We have become profoundly disconnected from the fields that feed us and it can be difficult to know, as we stand in the supermarket aisles, whether our food has been grown sustainably. We often don’t realise that, behind the misleading packaging, a lot of what we eat doesn’t come from our own landscapes, but from far-off places where animal welfare or environmental regulations are almost non-existent. Responding to this crisis, many people opt for a “plant-based diet”. For sure, there are sensible reasons to eat lots of fruit, nuts and vegetables. But if those plants were produced in landscape-scale monocultures, created by ploughing (which is increasingly understood to be an ecological disaster) and grown using either copious amounts of synthetic fertilisers or with industrial chicken litter and doused in pesticides – well, count me out. Such places would once have been biodiverse forests, mixed wild habitats or, perhaps, less destructive, more nature-friendly mixed farms. Yes, it takes less space, but it is the worst farming on Earth. The ethical reasoning doesn’t go nearly far enough. Likewise, just choosing to eat “local” food doesn’t cut it if that food is produced in ecologically disastrous ways. Even choosing to eat “organic” doesn’t necessarily meet the challenge, because organic fields are often ploughed and, at vast scale, devastate wildlife and release huge quantities of carbon into the air. The difficult truth is that there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all global sustainable diet that will solve the ecological crisis at one fell swoop. We are all local to somewhere and owning, seeing and taking responsibility for our food and how it is grown is imperative. We need to re-engage with the fields that feed us. We need to learn about and care about farming once more. As a first step, I would urge everyone to try to grow something of their own to eat, at least once. Of course, not everyone is lucky enough to own a field, or even a garden, but just growing something like a packet of lettuce on a windowsill can help to appreciate the beauty, the challenge and the sheer miracle of growing food. It helps us to start to think about the soil, about the life we’re nurturing, about the elemental processes that sustain us all. As you do so, you might start to think of the British countryside as your garden. You wouldn’t walk into it and expect to eat something from it that you couldn’t actually grow, or something out of season, or something that trashed your garden. Instead, you would look at what was available in each season and try to eat accordingly. Beyond this, if you can, get your food direct from a farmer with a sustainable farming system and environmental values (quite a lot of them can be found on social media and, yes, they often home deliver). Or try being a nuisance and ask more questions in shops and restaurants about where the food came from. If it doesn’t have an origin, a story you can understand, don’t buy it. And then be noisy. Demand changes to our laws that raise our standards and encourage progressive change on farms via environmental schemes. Above all, right now we should all raise our voices against the proposed US trade deal that would drive things to be much, much worse. When we find ways to farm regeneratively and in ways that allow nature to thrive around us, then we will have a range of foodstuffs to choose from. We can then take our pick and eat what we each think is right and good. • James Rebanks is a farmer based in the Lake District. His latest book is English Pastoral"

"WASHINGTON  —   A team of prominent constitutional scholars, Supreme Court litigators and former White House ethics lawyers intends to file a lawsuit Monday morning alleging that President Trump is violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments. The lawsuit is among a barrage of legal actions against the Trump administration that have been initiated or are being planned by major liberal advocacy organizations. Such suits are among the few outlets they have to challenge the administration now that Republicans are in control of the government. In the new case, the lawyers argue that a provision in the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause bans payments from foreign powers like the ones to Mr. Trump’s companies. They cite fears among the framers of the Constitution that United States officials could be corrupted by gifts or payments. The suit, which will not seek any monetary damages, will ask a federal court in New York to order Mr. Trump to stop taking payments from foreign government entities. Such payments, it says, include those from patrons at Trump hotels and golf courses loans for his office buildings from certain banks controlled by foreign governments and leases with tenants like the Abu Dhabi tourism office, a government enterprise. “The framers of the Constitution were students of history,” said Deepak Gupta, one of the lawyers behind the suit. “And they understood that one way a republic could fail is if foreign powers could corrupt our elected leaders. ” The president’s son Eric Trump, who is an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said the company had taken more steps than required by law to avoid legal exposure, such as agreeing to donate any profits collected at   hotels that come from foreign government guests to the United States Treasury. “This is purely harassment for political gain, and, frankly, I find it very, very sad,” he said in an interview on Sunday. The president’s lawyers have argued that the constitutional provision does not apply to   payments, such as a standard hotel room bill, and is intended only to prevent federal officials from accepting a special consideration or gift from a foreign power. “No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument,” one of the lawyers, Sheri A. Dillon, a partner at Morgan Lewis, said at a news conference this month. The legal team filing the lawsuit includes Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard constitutional scholar Norman L. Eisen, an Obama administration ethics lawyer and Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine. Among the others are Richard W. Painter, an ethics counsel in the administration of George W. Bush Mr. Gupta, a Supreme Court litigator who has three cases pending before the court and Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham University law professor and former congressional candidate who has been studying and writing about the Emoluments Clause for nearly a decade. Ms. Teachout said the one place of potential concern was a nation like China, which rents space at Trump Tower in New York and is a major lender to an office building in New York that Mr. Trump controls in part. Foreign governments, Ms. Teachout and other ethics experts warn, could rent out rooms in Trump hotels as a way to send a message to the Trump family. “If you think other countries are not going to try to leverage relationships with Trump’s companies to influence trade or military policy, that is naïve,” she said. But Andy Grewal, a University of Iowa law school professor, argued in an academic paper published last week that a payment to a hotel owned by the Trump family, like the Trump International Hotel in Washington, would not violate the Emoluments Clause because the money is paid to a corporate entity and not to Mr. Trump directly. “There is no connection between the payment and performance of services by the president personally,” Mr. Grewal said. “It would be a lot of fun to watch,” he said of the lawsuit, “but I imagine it will be kicked out. ” Mr. Eisen said the legal team intended to use the lawsuit to try to get a copy of Mr. Trump’s federal tax returns, which are needed to properly assess what income or other payments or loans Mr. Trump has received from foreign governments. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is a liberal group known as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which until recently was controlled by David Brock, a Democratic Party operative and fervent supporter of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Eisen now serves as chairman of the organization’s board, and Mr. Painter is vice chairman. The lawsuit may run into trouble, other legal experts said, given that CREW, as the organization is known, must demonstrate that it would suffer direct and concrete injury to give it standing to sue. The group says it has suffered harm by having to divert resources from other work to monitor and respond to Mr. Trump’s activities. For example, the group said, it has answered hundreds of questions from news organizations. In a 1982 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a civil rights organization had standing to sue because its use of black “testers” to see whether landlords and home sellers were abiding by federal law had hurt its ability to conduct other activities. But in recent decades, and outside the context of civil rights violations, the court has often been skeptical of broad assertions of standing. Regardless of the lawsuit’s fate, it is just the first hint of the legal assault that the Trump administration will face. Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said it was separately looking for plaintiffs to file a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause. It hopes to find a hotel or    that might compete against a Trump hotel as a party with standing to sue. The A. C. L. U. filed an extensive Freedom of Information Act request on Thursday asking the Justice Department, the General Services Administration and the Office of Government Ethics for all legal opinions and memos they have prepared addressing financial or ethical conflicts that Mr. Trump might face. It could potentially use those documents in litigation against the Trump administration. CREW filed a separate complaint with the General Services Administration on Friday over a provision that appears to prohibit the leasing of the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to an elected federal official. The building is the site of Mr. Trump’s hotel. Perhaps more important, the legal groups said they might challenge executive actions Mr. Trump is expected to take on topics like international trade deals, illegal immigration and climate change."
"The nights are drawing in, leaves are changing from green to gold, and energy suppliers are announcing price hikes. Along with animals disappearing into hibernation, energy price rises have become what looks to be a permanent sign of the start of winter. Last week, Npower and Scottish Power joined British Gas and SSE in announcing this years’ price rises, attributing increases to a mixture of wholesale, network, and policy costs. With energy bills at record levels and more households falling into fuel poverty, parties have been keen to offer solutions. But none have identified the two most fundamental things missing - significant levels of demand reduction, and strong, courageous leadership. The most radical solution to rising energy bills is Ed Miliband’s 20-month price freeze, during which time he would impose reforms on the industry: separating the energy generation and supply arms of the Big Six energy companies, reintroducing the electricity pool (a previous form of market structure, replaced by the current arrangement in 2001), scrapping Ofgem, and forming an Energy Security Board. But the price freeze in particular has been very popular among the electorate - though less so among commentators, such as Professor Dieter Helm who warns “it is hard to think of any measure better designed to undermine incentives to invest”. He is however more complimentary of some of Labour’s other proposals, as are several of the Big Six’s chief execs who appeared before the Energy and Climate Change Committee yesterday; agreeing that “virtual separation” of supply and generation was a good idea - although exactly  what that might entail isn’t yet clear. The coalition, caught on the hop by Miliband’s proposals, offered only two rather weak suggestions. The first was that people should switch energy supplier to find a cheaper tariff. Given that the latest figures from Ipsos Mori suggest that 60% of people have never switched energy supplier, I suspect that few will be motivated by the suggestion now. The second response came initially from George Osborne, but was reiterated by David Cameron last week, saying he would “roll-back” the green and social charges in customer bills which make up approximately 8% of the average dual-fuel bill. The largest share of these go towards the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) - a policy that pays for improving energy efficiency for poorer households. None of the Big Six or Ofgem seem to agree on the true cost of ECO, with estimates ranging from £47-£60 per household, although there is agreement that the charges are significant, and set to rise. But in spite of the costs, ECO has had a positive effect: nearly 245,000 installations in nearly 215,000 homes in its first eight months. What Osborne and Cameron seem to miss is that the energy efficiency measures these levies pay for are the best ways to create lasting protection for consumers, particularly the fuel-poor, against rising energy bills. The less energy required, the smaller the impact of rising prices. Any response that leads to the elimination of one of the only policies that protects the fuel poor is completely counter-productive. With polls from Carbon Brief, and ICM showing that only 7-11% of the public believe green taxes are pushing up bills, this appears to be little more than a short-sighted bid to appease the Tory right, at the cost of the worst off. Nick Clegg offered a small flicker of hope last week when he pledged not to turn his back on the poor or the environment, suggesting that levying green and social charges from taxation may offer an alternative solution. This proposal received wide support many of the Big Six firms yesterday, who said that if ECO was funded from general taxation, those savings could be passed directly to consumers. Shifting the burden of paying for such policies from bills to general taxation is a potentially progressive step, but is not entirely risk free. James Murray, editor of Business Green, warns that it may not be as straightforward as it seems. As well as disrupting current projects in the short term, future projects would be exposed to greater levels of political risk as efficiency schemes compete for public cash. Reducing energy demand by increasing efficiency is one of the most effective ways to beat price rises. Rather than cutting such schemes, the UK needs significantly more. Current legislation requires new homes to be highly efficient (at least by UK standards), but existing homes have no such requirement and the forthcoming requirements on rented properties is very weak.  Legislation must go further, and consumers cannot be expected to go it alone. A legal requirement for all homes to be of a certain standard, as proposed by Dr Brenda Boardman, backed by a means-tested financial support mechanism, funded from taxation, could provide enormous protection for the whole of the British public against future energy price rises. Reducing the effect of future price rises is essential, but so too is cutting off the problem at source. Wholesale gas prices are responsible for the greatest percentage of bill increases, but the government can do little to control this. While the elimination of green levies is something the government can do to reduce bills, a more determined transition to a clean energy system, free from the whims of international gas markets, would be more logical. It seems that underlying all of this is the problem of leadership. To stand firmly behind the need for an energy transition, while forcing disengaged consumers to insulate their homes and ensuring the funds are there for them to do so, requires real political courage. Given we are in a world where the suggestion of wearing jumpers at home quickly leads to considerable back-pedalling, the required sort of leadership seems in short supply. A version of this article appeared on the University of Exeter’s IGov blog."
"The government is currently ‘thieving’ from farmers to demonstrate its green credentials.
Pretending they can control natural, cyclical, global warming.
To protect farmers from the government’s insanity, misrepresentations and fraud, a man is dying.
Property rights are fundamental to freedom.
The key is not CO2. The key is the vital use of fuels containing carbon. That is a massive lucrative tax base. And controlling energy controls modern society.
The government’s fraudulent desire for tax and control is exposed.
The ETS will hurt everyone. Stifling regulations will hurt everyone. Who’s next? You are, we are.
For what benefit? None. Regulating CO2 via theft of property without compensation is not protecting the environment, it is hurting the environment. It is undermining and discrediting science. It is an attack on the economy and an attack on freedom.
Attacks on freedom, a tax on freedom, a tax on life.
For a lie to take root and hurt us all, it only needs us as honest men and women to turn a blind eye.
Rudd-Wong misrepresentation of carbon: No science, no integrity, no benefit, no need – no way.
Send prayers for Peter and all farmers. Turn up the heat on politicians.
The real issue for farmers is an issue for all of us – property rights are a cornerstone of freedom.
Protect freedom.

Paris Agreement China pledge irresponsible
The first by Harris, 2017, calls China’s Paris pledge on climate change “inadequate and irresponsible” and “little more than business as usual“.
Today China is the largest national source of greenhouse gas pollution and thus to solve the “problem” of climate change, China is the country that needs to do the most.  But the paper writes that the Paris Agreement “disregards such obligations“. The paper adds:
The inadequacy and irresponsibility of China’s Paris pledge exposes some fundamental flaws in the international climate change negotiations and agreements, demonstrating that science and environmental studies cannot be disconnected from ethics and justice.”
The Paris Agreement is not going to accomplish anything. China is on board because its leaders know they won’t be obligated to do anything differently. It generally gets a free pass. Under the bottom line, there is no agreement in place that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, it isn’t going to happen.
Climate change will be “slightly positive”

The next paper is by Tol, 2017, where he clearly reminds us that climate change is not only bad, like many “experts” like to have us believe it is. An excerpt from page 2:
Research has shown that climate change would bring both positive and negative impacts (Arent et al. 2014, Schneider et al. 2007, Smith et al. 2001, Pearce et al. 1996). Positive impacts include a reduced demand for energy for winter heating, fewer cold-related deaths, and carbon dioxide fertilization which makes crops grow faster and reduces their demand for water. Negative impacts include sea level rise, the spread of tropical diseases, and increases in storm intensity, droughts, and floods. Adding up all these impacts after having expressed them in welfare equivalents, the impact of initial climate change is probably slightly positive. This is irrelevant for policy, because initial climate change cannot be avoided. More pronounced climate change would have net negative effects, and these impacts would accelerate with further warming. Even so, the impacts would be moderate: The welfare impact of a century of climate change is comparable with the welfare impact of a year of economic growth (Tol 2015). Uncertainties are large, though, but even the most pessimistic estimates show that welfare loss due to a century of climate change is comparable to that of losing a decade of growth (Stern et al. 2006).”
Concerning the negative impacts some may not be the problem they are assumed to be (tropical diseases, storm intensity), or the problem will take decades and centuries to show up (sea level rise). The author also mquestions the merits of fighting climate change, noting that it “cannot be avoided”.
From binding agreement to “pledge and review”
Moreover, the international community appears to have given up on pursuing a binding treaty. The paper states on page 7:
There are no sanctions for missing targets – indeed Article 15 explicitly states that the ‘mechanism to […] promote compliance’ is ‘non-punitive’. Article 28 stipulates that a country may withdraw from the Paris Agreement without sanction.
In other words, after 20 years of trying and failing to negotiate a treaty with legally binding emission reduction targets, the Paris Agreement switched to pledge and review.”

In honor of April 22, consider this picture:   






It’s taken from Zhu et al’s 2016 paper, “Greening of the Earth and its Drivers.” “Leaf Area Index” is a measure of the density of vegetation cover. It’s positive over most of the planet, and especially so in the purple‐​shaded regions, which are mainly the tropical rainforest, the most diverse and revered of our ecosystems.   
  
  
Only 4% of the surface shows the opposite, or a significant “browning.” The causes of the planetary greening? In a word, “us.” According to the Zhu et al., 91% of the greening is attributable to human activity. Perhaps it’s best to simply quote from the paper:   




Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC) (4%). CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau.



Again, Happy Earth Day!
