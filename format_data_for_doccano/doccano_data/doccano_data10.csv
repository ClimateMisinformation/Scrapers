"The British town of Wainfleet in Lincolnshire is underwater. After two months rain in two days, the River Steeping burst its banks, and 580 homes were evacuated. Curiously, the advice to the town’s remaining residents is to avoid flushing the toilet or using the washing machine whenever possible – advice that is more usually associated with drought rather than flood. The request suggests that Wainfleet’s sewer system is dangerously close to capacity. Using the loo and washing machine not only puts a demand on the water supply system, but it also adds to the flows in the local sewer, which is likely to be very full. Like most towns in Europe, Wainfleet’s town centre was constructed before the 1950s, and will be served by a “combined sewer” that takes both the waste water from toilets and showers, and the rainwater from roofs and roads. This resulting dilute waste water  then needs to be treated before it is discharged into the environment. If the volume of water is too much for the treatment plant to handle then a “combined sewage overflow” will release dilute sewage into rivers and oceans.  It is because of combined sewage overflows that it’s not a good idea to bathe in rivers or beaches after there has been rainfall.   An additional problem in Wainfleet (and many low-lying areas like London, much of the Netherlands or New Orleans in the US) is that the sewer system is lower than the level of the river or sea. This means that the wastewater/rainwater combination does not just need treatment, but it also needs pumping. If there is too much water for the treatment works or pumps to process at any one moment, then water from streets or homes will be unable to enter the sewer system, and dirty water, including dilute sewage, can overflow into rivers, streets and homes. A dramatic example of this happened in Hull in 2007. Just like in Wainfleet, heavy summer rainstorms put pressure on treatment systems and pumps. More than 8,000 homes were flooded, and some people were out of their homes for over a year. Such flooding causes huge physical disruption and challenges people’s mental health. Imagine unexpectedly losing most of your possessions, simultaneously needing to find a new place to live for an unpredictable length of time, having to manage the family routines from a different location, and meanwhile having to negotiate with insurers and builders about the renewal of your home. As climate change threatens to bring more sudden rainstorms, many places are becoming more vulnerable to problems like those in Wainfleet and Hull. One way to address these problems is to slow down the flow of rainwater. The hard surfaces of roads, pavements and pipes, for example, speed up the flow of water. Some agricultural drainage practices may also encourage water to flow rather than waterlog the land. What this all means is that all the water from the rainstorm arrives at the treatment and pumping facilities at the same time. We can address these problems – in Wainfleet as elsewhere – but it will take many small changes to the way people manage their water. All over the world, local authorities are exploring how they can repurpose parks and other open spaces to help to store the water from heavy rainfall. In Firs Farm Park in the London borough of Enfield, for example, playing fields have been raised and others transformed into wetland to hold back the water and prevent flooding downstream. This work has helped to stimulate the involvement of local people in maintaining the park, while the wetlands provide a nature resource for schoolchildren.  Similar projects are being explore as far apart as Bergen, Norway, and Belo Horizonte, Brazil. On a smaller scale, water can be held back in street rain gardens. These small patches of planting combined with dropped kerbs offer opportunities for infiltrating water and greening the streets. Residents may have to sacrifice some local parking spaces, but such investments can make a neighbourhood more pleasant for everyone, as well as reducing the flows downstream. The request to minimise household inputs to the sewer system is one small immediate way to mobilise local residents to help address the threat of flooding. But residents with a garden can help in other ways too. Most UK houses have gutters that discharge directly to the sewer. Depending on the local geology, garden soakaways (stone-filled ditches which can soak up water if it rains), retain the water so it drains more slowly to the ground or the sewer. Another way to accomplish this task is with a raintank. Most people think of raintanks (or water butts) as a way to protect against droughts. But as long as a tank has some space in it, it also has the potential to provide added protection for a neighbourhood from flooding. My research team is currently exploring whether we can make “leaky raintanks”. The idea here is that as well as storing water for use in the garden, the tank will also have a space which is able to fill up in a storm and then drain slowly into the sewer. If every household in a neighbourhood had a “leaky raintank”, it could make a significant difference to the amount of water storage during a storm. Whether helping to replan the local park, participating in discussing which parts of the street can form a rain garden, or through managing a soakaway or raintank on your private land, water management is increasingly seen as something which is too big and too important to leave just to technical experts. We are all part of the water system, and those that manage water are recognising that people are able and willing to undertake actions to improve the water system.   Meanwhile, technical experts more widely need to recognise that water is part of lived in and natural landscapes – and this must be reflected in sewers and streets. In a time in which water-related threats are worsening, society needs to look beyond isolated problems of floods or droughts, and to consider how wise water management can deliver local benefits as well as a more resilient landscape for everyone."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
People have upbraided me for not doing an in-depth analysis of the paper “Earth’s Energy Imbalance and Implications“, by James Hansen et al. (hereinafter H2011). In that paper they claim that the earth has a serious energy imbalance, based on the change in oceanic heat content (OHC). Here’s my quick analysis of the paper. A more probing discussion will follow.
Figure 1. What could happen if the ocean gets warm. Dangers include increased risk of lassitude, along with augmented consumption of intoxicants and possible loss of clothing, accompanied by mosquito bites in recondite locations.
Here’s how I proceeded for a quick look at the H2011 results. The paper says that during the period 2005 – 2010, the warming of the entire global ocean, from the surface down to the abyssal depths, is the equivalent of 0.54 W/m2 of energy.
When I read that, the first thing I did was make the conversion to degrees per year of oceanic warming. I wanted to see what they were saying, but measured in meaningful units. A half watt per square metre of energy going into the global ocean means nothing to me. I wanted to know how fast the ocean was warming from this rumored imbalance. The conversion from watts per square metre to degrees Celsius ocean warming per year goes as follows.
We want to convert from watts per square metre (a continuous flow of energy) to degrees of warming per year (the annual warming due to that flow of energy). Here’s the method of the calculations. No need to follow the numbers unless you want to, if you do they are given in the appendix. The general calculation goes like this:
An energy flow of one watt per square metre (W/m2) maintained for 1 year is one watt-year per square metre (W-yr/m2). That times seconds /year (secs/yr) gives us watt-seconds per square metre (W-secs/m2). But a watt-second is a joule, so the result is joules per square metre (J/m2).
To convert that to total joules for the globe, we have to multiply by square metres of planetary surface, which gives us total joules per year (J/yr). That is the total joules per year for the entire globe resulting from the energy flow in watts per square metre.
That completes the first part of the calculation. We know how many joules of energy per year are resulting from a given number of watts per square metre of incoming energy.
All that’s left is to divide the total joules of incoming energy per year (J/yr) that we just calculated, by the number of joules required per degree of ocean warming (J/°C), to give us a resultant ocean warming in degrees per year (°C/yr).
The result of doing that math for the 0.54 W/m2 of global oceanic forcing reported in H2011 is the current rate of oceanic warming, in degrees per year. So step up and place your bets, how great is the earth’s energy imbalance according to Hansen et al., how many degrees are the global oceans warming per year?  … les jeux sont fait, my friends, drumroll please … may I have the envelope … oh, this is a surprise, there will be some losers in the betting …

The answer (if Hansen et al. are correct) is that if the ocean continues to warm at the 2005-2010 rate, by the year 2100 it will have warmed by a bit more than a tenth of a degree … and it will have warmed by one degree by the year 2641.
Now, I don’t think that the Hansen et al. analysis is correct, for two reasons. First, I don’t think their method for averaging the Argo data is as accurate as the proponents claim. They say we can currently determine the temperature of the top mile of depth of the ocean to a precision of ± eight thousandths of a degree C. I doubt that.
Second, they don’t use the right mathematical tools to do the analysis of the float data. But both of those are subjects for another post, which I’ve mostly written, and which involves the Argo floats.
In any case, whether or not H2011 is correct, if the ocean wants to change temperature by a tenth of a degree by the year 2100, I’m certainly not the man to try to stop it. I learned about that from King Canute.
w.
APPENDIX:  Some conversion factors and numbers.
One joule is one watt applied for one second. One watt applied for one year = 1 watt-year * 365.25 days/year * 24 hrs/day * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute =  31,557,946 watt – seconds = 31.56e+6 joules.
Mass of the ocean = 1.37e+18 tonnes
It requires 3.99 megajoules (3.99e+6 joules) to raise one tonne of sea water by 1°C
Joules to raise the entire ocean one degree Celsius = tonnes/ocean * joules per tonne per degree = 5.48e+24 joules per degree of oceanic warming
Surface area of the the planet = 5.11e14 square metres
1 W/m2 = 1.60e+22 joules annually
So the whole calculation runs like this:
    .54 W/m2 *1.6e+22 joules/yr/(W/m2)

------------------------------------------------   =  0.0016 °C/yr

       5.48e+24 Joules/°C

"Summer is here – for many, a time for holidays and travelling, often by plane. Air travel has risen steeply on a global level. Since 2004 alone, passenger numbers have more than doubled, from two billion to 4.4 billion in 2018, with new record numbers forecast for 2019. Emissions from global air travel are predicted to double or even treble again by 2050 if no action is taken. Universities play a role in this with a high and rising air travel footprint. Academics are frequent air travellers – to present at international conferences, conduct and review research, network and collaborate. “International recognition” forms an important criterion for academic job descriptions and promotions, and universities increasingly benefit from international student fees and international research funding. Many academics see travelling to far-flung places as the perk of the job – to compensate for long hours and performance pressures.  Some might argue that extensive academic travel is justified by the positive contribution that academic research and teaching make to society. But in a world which needs to reduce emissions down to net-zero by 2050 at the latest to stay within planetary boundaries, the sector will need to engage in a more open debate about its air travel carbon footprint and options to reduce it.

      It's time to wake up to the devastating impact flying has on the environment


 The problem starts with a lack of precise data on the air travel footprint of the higher education sector. In the UK, the first port of call should be data collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Currently, UK universities are asked to submit data on flight emissions to HESA, either based on destinations or on spending on flights. This is not obligatory – in the past three years only 43% have done so. Unfortunately, the data show likely errors which compromise their usefulness. For instance, the database records extremely high figures for a small number of universities which skew the calculation of mean emissions. This may be because calculating carbon emissions from expenditure is not very reliable. The database also does not distinguish between flights taken by academic and non-academic staff, even though their flight behaviour is likely to be different. Clearer reporting standards and data checks are urgently required so we can examine the sector’s flight carbon footprint more precisely. To create an estimate, let’s instead cautiously assume that the average academic in the UK attends just one international conference or meeting per year by plane, for instance one in the US, with a CO₂ emissions footprint of about five tonnes. Based on one of my earlier studies, this is over ten times as much as the average UK person’s carbon footprint from leisure flights, and nearly 20% more than the average UK person’s total annual carbon footprint from travel and home energy combined.  With 211,980 academic staff in UK higher education in 2017/8, this would add up to a total of nearly 1.1m tonnes of CO2 emissions per year – equivalent to the average total annual consumption-based carbon footprint of over 120,000 people in the UK. Since most academics fly multiple times per year, this could easily be an underestimate.  What about global figures? If we scale up the estimated CO₂ emissions from academic staff air travel in the UK per higher education institution (around 6,583 tonnes CO₂ for each of the 161 institutions in 2017) to the at least 28,000 universities globally, it would amount to 184m tonnes of CO₂ globally - nearly 50% of the UK’s total CO₂ emissions in 2017. Add to this the carbon footprint of international student air travel. In 2017/18, 458,490 international students were enrolled in UK higher education institutions. Of those, nearly 70% came from outside of the EU, especially from China with 23%.  If each student takes just one return flight per year to visit home, this would add up to around 1.8m tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year (assumed averages based on the atmosfair calculator of 0.8 tonnes per return flight for EU, 5.4 tonnes for China, five tonnes for the rest of the world). Both staff and international student numbers in the UK have been rising over the last few years. If this trend continues, the carbon footprint from academic air travel is also likely to increase.  Demand reduction will need to play an important role in bringing air travel emissions down to zero by 2050. This is because technological options for decarbonising air travel, such as carbon-neutral electrofuels, are very expensive and extremely challenging to scale up. Meanwhile ,carbon offsetting schemes are often thought to be insufficiently effective as many fail to deliver additional carbon reductions.

      Aviation emissions are rising – and industry solutions are just technological myths


 But university management and academics can do various things to reduce flying. Environmental assessments of travel and research project plans should become a requirement as part of already existing ethics and risk assessments. For every suggested flight, it would be important to assess a number of things. Is the journey really necessary, or can a meeting be held online instead? Can fieldwork abroad be conducted by remotely supervised local teams? If the journey is necessary, can it be made by train (which emits about a seventh of the emissions per passenger compared to air travel)?  Every journey booking should be submitted to a carbon calculator to raise awareness and collect better data. Academic job application and promotion criteria would need to be amended such that environmentally conscious academics are not punished for reducing or giving up flying.  The need to reduce air travel also raises very difficult questions in relation to student internationalisation agendas, and global mobility more generally. Online teaching for students abroad would need to expand considerably to minimise travel emissions. Of course, this would have the lamentable effect of removing the beneficial experience of living abroad and immersing oneself in a new culture. In many ways, structural incentives for air travel have become established within the higher education sector. This means neither university management nor academics will show much appetite for reducing flights. But if it wants to lead by example, the sector – like many others – urgently needs to collaborate globally to agree on reducing its impact from business travel."

It appears that the focus of this has to do with the refusal to give up station data in and the DOE’s apparent complicity in that issue as revealed in the CG2 emails in 2009 from Dr. Phil Jones at CRU.
From the Competitive Enterprise Institute (via email):
=============================================================
November 30, 2011
Freedom of Information Officer
Mr. Alexander Morris
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20585
RE:     FOIA Request – 2007 communications between Office of Science and Dr. Phil Jones
ByRegularandElectronicMail — Alexander.Morris@xxx.doe.gov
Dear Mr. Morris,
On behalf of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a not-for-profit policy organization in Washington, DC, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. and the relevant U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) implementing regulations, please consider the following Request.
Please provide us within twenty (20) working days copies of any and all record(s) — defined here as correspondence and any memoranda, analysis, other communications cited therein or attached — which were 

created, received and/or held by DoE’s Office of Science, and
sent by or to (including as a “cc:”) a Dr. Phil Jones of the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (typical, but likely not exclusive address: p.jones@uea.xxx), and
dated during the year 2007.

Background
Dr. Phil Jones, whose work has on occasion been funded in part by the U.S. taxpayer through DoE, is on record stating to parties requesting certain information things such as “Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it.” (Jones in a 2004 email to researcher Warwick Hughes).
Also, in the 2009 and 2011 “ClimateGate” releases of emails many or most of which had been subject to but improperly withheld under the UK’s FOI law, we have seen Jones’s admissions of destroying correspondence in response to or anticipation of FOI requests.
Most important to the present request, in several emails recently made public Phil Jones explicitly states that the DOE informed him it is “happy about [Jones] not releasing the original [temperature] station data” to researchers requesting that particular information, which information was funded by the U.S. taxpayer through DoE.
The data at issue was also requested under a the UK’s FOI law. Jones was funded by the U.S. taxpayer. As taxpayers we have a right to learn relevant facts of apparently public employee-enabling of a scientist they fund to avoid FOI requests.
Examples of recently released correspondence supporting the public’s need for this information is found in, e.g., “ClimateGate 2011” emails that DoE offered this counsel in 2007.
In email 1577, Phil Jones says the following:
“Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden. I’ve discussed this with the main funder (US Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.” (July 28, 2009)
Also, he repeats this in email 1217:
“Work on the land station data has been funded by the US Dept of Energy, and I have their agreement that the data needn’t be passed on. I got this in 2007.” (May 13, 2009)
Transparency
We note the inauguralpost on the White House “blog” made immediately upon President Obama’s swearing-in to office which restated, in pertinent part, a prominent promise made when courting votes during the election campaign:
Transparency — President Obama has committed to making his administration the most open and transparent in history, and WhiteHouse.gov will play a major role in delivering on that promise. The President’s executive orders and proclamations will be published for everyone to review, and that’s just the beginning of our efforts to provide a window for all Americans into the business of the government. You can also learn about some of the senior leadership in the new administration and about the President’s policy priorities. WhiteHouse.gov, “Change has come to WhiteHouse.gov”, January 20, 2009 (12:01 p.m.), http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/change_has_come_to_whitehouse-gov/
Scope of Request
This Request for the described records covers DoE’sOfficeofScience(particularlyincluding,butnotlimitedto,itsOfficeofBiologicalandEnvironmentalResearch,andtheClimateandEnvironmentalSciencesDivisionanditsEarthSystemModelingProgram), and the period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, inclusive.
Please identify and inform us of all responsive or potentially responsive documents within the statutorily prescribed time, and the basis of any claimed exemptions or privilege and to which specific responsive or potentially responsive document(s) such objection applies. Further, please inform us of the basis of any partial denials or redactions.
Specifically, if your office takes the position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, we request that you provide us with an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1972), with sufficient specificity “to permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA” pursuant to Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 959 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and “describ[ing] each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of supplying the sought-after information.” King v. U.S. Department of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223-24 (D.C. Cir. 1987).
In the event that some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the requested records. See 5 U.S.C. §552(b). If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments and that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the documents as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt and how the material is dispersed through the document. Mead Data Central v. U.S. Department of the Air Force, 455 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Claims of non-segregability must be made with the same detail as required for claims of exemption in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.
Please provide copies of documents, in electronic format if you possess them as such, otherwise photocopies are acceptable. By this we mean that no delay need be incurred on the basis that the records are held in a particular format and must be transferred as we seek them as held in whatever medium or bearing whatever physical characteristics may be the case.
Request for Fee Waiver
We request your office(s) waive any fees associated with this request on the basis that CEI is a nonprofit, tax-exempt public interest organization, with formal research, educational and publication functions as part of its mission, and because release of these records will serve the public interest by contributing significantly to the public’s understanding of the controversial topics of environmental and science-related policy and specifically the ongoing debate over the transparency and credibility of taxpayer-funded science and the activities of taxpayer-funded scientists, and because such a release is not primarily in our organization’s commercial interest.
If our fee waiver request is denied we are willing to pay up to $50.00, and in the event of any appeal as appropriate and regardless of that outcome or your response to this fee waiver request we request the search and document production proceed in the interim.
As explained below and in our initial Request, this FOIA Request satisfies the factors customarily considered for waiver or reduction of fees, as well as the requirements of fee waiver under the FOIA statute – that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), see also inter alia DOE’s implementing regulations, Title10,CodeofFederalRegulations(Section1004.9).
CEI promotes the public interest advocating sensible policies to protect human health and the environment including through education on activities of government and taxpayer-supported entities, and has routinely received fee waivers under FOIA.
CEI is a national, nonprofit organization dedicated in great part to relevant energy and environment issues with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, CEI intends to use the requested information to inform the public, so the public can meaningfully participate in the policymaking process related to hydrocarbon energy production and use with complete, relevant information.
1. The subject matter of the requested records must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the government.
The requested records relate to DoE’s process and advice given regarding obligations to disclose certain details regarding taxpayer-funded work. Pursuant to FOIA this process, related correspondence, these determinations and the policies and procedures on which they are based are unquestionably “identifiable operations or activities of the government.” The Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act Guide expressly concedes that “in most cases records possessed by federal agency will meet this threshold” of identifiable operations or activities of the government. There can be no question that this is such a case.
2. For the disclosure to be “likely to contribute” to an understanding of specific government operations or activities, the releasable material must be meaningfully informative in relation to the subject matter of the request.
The disclosure of the requested documents must have an informative value and be “likely to contribute to an understanding of Federal government operations or activities.” The Freedom of Information Act Guide makes it clear that, in the Department of Justice’s view, the “likely to contribute” determination hinges in substantial part on whether the requested documents provide information that is not already in the public domain. The requested records are “likely to contribute” to an understanding of your agency’s activities because with limited exceptions they are not otherwise in the public domain and are not accessible other than through a FOIA request.
Given current concerns about the credibility of certain taxpayer-funded research and related processes (as revealed in, inter alia, the “ClimateGate” release of emails in 2009 and 2011), this information will facilitate meaningful public understanding of the described campaign, therefore fulfilling the requirement that the documents requested be “meaningfully informative” and “likely to contribute” to an understanding of your agency’s decision-making process and the controversial issue described above.
3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons.
Under this factor, the identity and qualifications of the requester—i.e., expertise in the subject area of the request and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public—is examined. As described in our Request, above and below, CEI has a well-established interest and expertise in the subject of taxpayer-funded science and the related regulatory policies, demonstrated through, inter alia, freedom of information requests and litigation.
More importantly, CEI unquestionably has the “specialized knowledge” and “ability and intention” to disseminate the information requested in the broad manner, and to do so in a manner that contributes to the understanding of the “public-at-large.” CEI intends to disseminate the information it receives through FOIA regarding these government operations and activities in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, analysis and distribution to the media, distribution through publication and mailing, posting on the organizations’ websites, and emailing.
As shown by the extensive public discussion following revelation of certain tactics in the “ClimateGate” releases, these records are the subject of great public interest. To deny this would be prima facie capricious.
4. The disclosure must contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities.
With the exception of the limited ClimateGate releases which do include Phil Jones flatly stating he has corresponded with DoE and received a staffer’s blessing to withhold data, there are currently no records publicly available regarding the requested information — correspondence to and from DoE addressing this matter. Absent disclosure of the records requested, the public’s understanding will be shaped only by what we are told was a “selective” and “out of context” release of emails. Further, Jones’ admissions of having destroyed records makes release of DoE’s versions more important to the public debate.
The records requested will contribute to the public understanding of the government’s role, or their “operations and activities” associated with this critically important information. The disclosure of the requested records is also essential to public understanding of DoE decision making process, its advice to parties it funds regarding transparency, and U.S. influence in critical “climate science” efforts including but not limited to the “IPCC” process. After disclosure of these records, the public’s understanding of this process will be significantly enhanced. The requirement that disclosure must contribute “significantly” to the public understanding is therefore met.
5. The extent to which disclosure will serve the requester’s commercial interest, if any.
As already stated CEI has no commercial interest in the information sought or otherwise in the requested records. Nor does ATI have any intention to use these records in any manner that “furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest” as those terms are commonly understood. CEI is a tax-exempt organization under sections 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and as such has no commercial interest. The requested records will be used for the furtherance of CEI’s mission to inform the public on matters of vital importance to the regulatory process and policies relating to energy and the environment.
6. The extent to which the identified public interest in the disclosure outweighs the requester’s commercial interest.
See answers to factors 1-5 above. Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” When a commercial interest is found to exist and that interest would be furthered by the requested disclosure, an agency must assess the magnitude of such interest in order to compare it to the “public interest” in disclosure. If no commercial interest exists, an assessment of that non-existent interest is not required. As noted above, ATI has no commercial interest in the requested records.
Disclosure of this information is not “primarily” in CEI’s commercial interest. On the other hand, it is clear that the disclosure of the information requested is in the public interest. It will contribute significantly to public understanding of the regulatory process as already described.
We respectfully request, because the public will be the primary beneficiary of this requested information, that DoE waive processing and copying fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(a)(4)(A). In the event that your agency denies a fee waiver, please send a written explanation for the denial. Also, please continue to produce the records as expeditiously as possible, but in any event no later than the applicable FOIA deadlines.
Sincerely,
Christopher C. Horner

Of course, you’re savvy enough to know we won’t be sending actual gifts to Santa. You will receive a tax receipt for 100% of your purchase and proceeds will be used by the David Suzuki Foundation to support our critical work to protect nature and the environment from threats like climate change.
Buying these green gifts and personalized ecards on behalf of hard-to-buy-for friends or relatives on your holiday list is a great way to show you’re thinking of them — and the planet!
Act now to help Santa!
Sincere thanks,
The David Suzuki Foundation
This is nothing more than a thinly veiled revenue generator for the foundation.
No shame, no scruples, just send money. Is it any wonder informed people are doubting the climate change issue when presented with crap like this?
h/t to Mike Bromley in Canada who writes:
Canadian geneticist-turned-environmentalist David Suzuki targeted children in his latest outburst of emotionally-charged enviro-gab, this time scaring the fun out of Christmas by warning that Santa’s home was melting.  In a post-black-Friday period of climate-ethical circus generation, this takes the cake.  This is beyond reprehensible.
Here’s what the North Pole looks like today:

UPDATE: Here’s a clip from 1972 showing Suzuki comparing humans to maggots in his own words. Looks like that must have been his Che’ Guevara period. (h/t Daily Bayonet)

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language The Local from France reports here that clothing retailers have been hard hit by the economic crisis and exacerbated by unusually cold weather so far this summer.


Cold conditions persist over western Europe. Temperature anomaly forecast next 7 days. Source: wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html
Some weather agencies have been trying for months to convince the public that the recent cool temperatures are actually normal and that the coolness is just in our heads. However, consumer behavior is telling us something completely different: It really is cool outside.
The Local writes that “French retailers have started this year’s summer sales early, offering drastic reductions to bargain hunters.”
Among the reasons, The Local cites one retailer (my emphasis):

‘Because of the bad weather, customers have been looking in particular for winter stuff,’ one young shoe vendor in the capital told French daily Le Parisien on Monday. … Which is bad news for apparel and accessories stores who have stockpiled their shorts, swimwear and t-shirts for the summer season.
‘We still have at least 50 percent more stock than usual,’ the vendor added.”

Meanwhile the weather forecast is warning that some areas of Germany may see surface frost in the nights ahead as an early summer cold spell once again grips the country in the days ahead. Read here.
In the days ahead there is indeed once again the risk of surface frost, according to meteorologist Dominik Jung of www.wetter.net. […] During the nights especially in the south there may be surface frost at some locations.”
Recent long-term forecasts circulating in the German media have projected a normal temperature summer with a mixed bag of sun and rain. The big question right now is whether a high pressure system located near the Azores will be able to expand to central Europe and bring summerlike conditions. The weather models are undecided on this.
The rule of thumb is that the weather pattern that establishes itself over Germany during the end of June and early July often (up to 70% chance) persists through much of the summer. This is a phenomenon known as Siebenschläfer in Germany. Right now things could be looking better.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Richard Muller and the good folks over at the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project have released their temperature analysis back to 1750, and are making their usual unsupportable claims. I don’t mean his risible statements that the temperature changes are due to CO2 because the curves look alike—that joke has been widely discussed and discounted, even by anthropogenic global warming (AGW) supporters. Heck, even Michael Mann jumped on him for that one, saying
It seems, in the end–quite sadly–that this is all really about Richard Muller’s self-aggrandizement 🙁
And if anyone should know about “self-aggrandizement”, it’s Michael Mann … but I’m not talking about Muller’s claim that humans caused the warming. No, I mean the following statement:

The historic temperature pattern we observe has abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect sunlight and cool the Earth’s surface for a few years.

In support of this statement, Richard Muller offers up the following chart:
Figure 1. BEST claims about temperature and volcanoes. SOURCE
So what’s not to like?
Well, first it appears he has included and excluded volcanoes depending on whether they show up in his temperature record. If we look at big eruptions, eruptions with a “volcanic explosively index” (VEI) of 6 or above, since 1750 we have the following volcanoes:
Mount Pinatubo, 1991
Novarupta, 1912
Santa María, 1902
Krakatoa, 1883
Mount Tambora, 1815
Grímsvötn and Laki, 1783
So Muller has left off Santa Maria and Novarupta, and included El Chichon and Cosiguina. But that’s not the real problem. The real problem is that many of these occurred after or during the temperature drop that they are supposed to have caused … here’s the BEST data including all relevant volcanoes, without the style of overlay that they have used that obscures the actual timing:
Figure 2. BEST temperature data and dates of volcanoes. Red line is a four-year centered Gaussian average of the temperature data. Photo shows Mt. Redoubt in Alaska.
So let’s look at the volcanoes, one by one:
LAKI, 1783: Occurred near the end of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
TAMBORA, 1815: Occurred at the end of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
COSIGUINA, 1835: Occurred near the middle of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
KRAKATOA, 1883: Occurred at the end of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
SANTA MARIA, 1902: Occurred in the middle of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
NOVARUPTA, 1912: I can see why Muller omitted this eruption, which occurred just before a rise in temperature …
EL CHICHON, 1982: Occurred during the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
PINATUBO, 1991: This is arguably the only one of the eight volcanoes that could legitimately be claimed to cause a detectable fall in temperature … a whopping fall of 0.15°C or so.
So while volcanoes certainly may cause a minor drop in global temperature, the claim of Richard Muller and the BEST folks that there are “abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions” is simply not true. There are abrupt dips, but they don’t match up with the volcanic eruptions.
w.
[Update] Further reading:
Prediction is hard, especially of the future discusses the GISS analysis of Pinatubo.
Missing the Missing Summer is about the eruption of Tambora.
Dronning Maud Meets the Little Ice Age investigates a claim that the Little Ice Age was triggered by vulcanism.
Volcanic Disruptions plays the game “Spot the Volcano”
[Update] Another way to investigate the question is to look at the average temperature anomaly during the two years before and the two years after the eruption. Figure 3 shows that result.
Figure 3. Average temperature anomaly two years before and two years after the eruptions. Black lines show the standard error of the mean.
After some eruptions it cooled a bit, after some it warmed a bit, and after some there was no change … go figure.

In the 1960s and 1970s, neo‐​Malthusian panic about overpopulation overtook eugenics as the primary motivation behind coercive policies aimed at limiting childbearing. Neo‐​Malthusian ideas spread among senior technocrats and government leaders in some developing countries, resulting in human rights abuses that Western development professionals encouraged and that Western aid often funded. Those abuses peaked in the form of China’s one‐​child policy (1979–2015) and India’s forced sterilizations during its “Emergency” (1975–77), a period in India when civil liberties were suspended and the prime minister ruled by decree.



The one‐​child policy saw over 300 million Chinese women fitted with intrauterine devices modified to be irremovable without surgery, over 100 million sterilizations, and over 300 million abortions. Many of these procedures were coerced. In a similar vein, India’s Emergency saw 11 million sterilizations, many of them forced.



China and, to a far lesser extent, India still have troubling policies. After softening its one‐​child policy to a two‐​child policy, China continues to brutally enforce family size limits and to require birth permits from prospective parents and parents seeking to expand their families. Coercion continues to define an unknown share of the country’s 9 million annual abortions. In India, political representation is apportioned in a way that punishes states with high birth rates. Half the people in India live in states with policies that penalize, to varying degrees, families with more than two children to discourage large families. Fortunately, recent policy changes are reversing heavy financial penalties imposed earlier on high‐​fertility states.



Neo‐​Malthusian policies aimed at limiting family size have increased female infanticide and sex‐​selective abortion in China and India, skewing the _world’s_ sex ratio at birth to 107 boys per 100 girls. (The natural ratio is 105 boys per 100 girls.)



Neo‐​Malthusianism remains the chief cause of family size restrictions. Countering overpopulation hysteria continues to be important.



The world is doomed, many people argue, citing poverty, dwindling natural resources, and an allegedly unsustainable rate of population growth. They say there are just too many problems to overcome. But is that really the case? Join the conversation and find out.



In 1983, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)—then the United Nations Fund for Population Activities—the world’s largest multilateral source of funding for government population programs, began issuing a prize called the Population Award, to be presented annually to “an individual, to individuals, or to an institution for the most outstanding contribution to the awareness of population questions or to their solutions.”1 The first prizewinners were Indira Gandhi, India’s prime minister who declared a national “Emergency” that suspended civil liberties and mandated sterilizations on a massive scale between 1975 and 1977, and Qian Xinzhong, head of China’s State Family Planning Commission and the man in charge of the country’s one‐​child policy, which lasted from 1979 to 2015.



The coercive nature of India’s Emergency and the atrocities of China’s one‐​child policy were already well known.2 The Nobel Prize–winning economist Theodore Schultz, chairman of the University of Chicago’s Department of Economics, resigned from the UNFPA Advisory Commission in protest of the award recipients.3



Why did the United Nations (UN) applaud Gandhi and Xinzhong, who had overseen coercive policies that victimized millions of people? Part of the answer can be found in UN Secretary‐​General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar’s statement as he presented the Population Award: “If rapid population growth in the developing nations is left unchecked, it will evidently undermine all efforts for economic and social development and could easily lead to widespread depletion of each nation’s resources.” He praised the “vision and foresight” of Gandhi and Xinzhong for their efforts toward “controlling population growth.”4



Neo‐​Malthusianism, defined as fear that a large population size could lead to a humanitarian and ecological disaster and that combating so‐​called overpopulation is thus an urgent problem—has real‐​world consequences. The belief has often resulted in support for coercive policies. Countering neo‐​Malthusianism is especially critical now given the recent prominence of such thinking.



At the 2020 World Economic Forum in Switzerland, famed primatologist Jane Goodall opined, “All these [environmental] things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.”5 The world population 500 years ago is estimated at 420–540 million people, or around 6.7 billion fewer people than today.



Goodall is far from alone in her belief that population growth is an urgent problem. In August 2019, the United Kingdom’s Prince Harry subtly suggested that children are a burden to the planet and that responsible couples should have “two, maximum.”6 Bill Nye, “the Science Guy,” supports the introduction of special taxes or other state‐​imposed penalties for having “too many” children.7 And popular television host Bill Maher in April 2019 declared: “I can’t think of a better gift to our planet than pumping out fewer humans to destroy it… . The great under‐​discussed factor in the climate crisis is there are just too many of us… . We don’t need smaller carbon footprints, we need less [sic] feet.”8



Recent examples of neo‐​Malthusian writings include op‐​eds appearing in prominent outlets such as _NBC News_ (“Science Proves Kids Are Bad for Earth. Morality Suggests We Stop Having Them”) and the _New York Times_ (“Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?,” which muses that “it may well be, then, that the extinction of humanity would make the world better off”).9 In April 2019, the progressive magazine _FastCompany_ released a video titled “Why Having Kids Is the Worst Thing You Can Do for the Planet.”10



Neo‐​Malthusianism enjoys support among some prominent elected officials. While historically overpopulation alarmism was a bipartisan concern in the United States championed by both Republicans and Democrats, in recent years it has been most common on the political left. When asked in September 2019 if he would enact a “campaign” to “curb population growth” to fight climate change if elected president, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) answered in the affirmative, noting he would focus on poor countries.11 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez (D-NY) famously questioned the morality of childbearing in the face of climate change earlier that year, asking, “Is it OK to still have children?”12 Presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden has even voiced acceptance of China’s family size limits, telling a Chinese audience, “Your policy has been one which I fully understand—I’m not second-guessing—of one child per family.”13



In November 2019, more than 11,000 scientists signed a report calling for the reduction of the world’s population to combat climate change.14 That report went viral and was shared on social media by many U.S. political figures, including Sanders and Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) as well as Reps. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) and Susie Lee (D-NV).15 Overpopulation alarmism, prominent in decades and centuries past, is undergoing a renaissance.



Others have offered in‐​depth critiques of neo‐​Malthusian theory.16 It turns out that birth rates tend to fall without coercion as countries grow richer and that population growth may make resources _more_ plentiful thanks to humanity’s capacity for innovation. Economist Julian Simon, for example, argued that the human mind is the “ultimate resource,” allowing humanity to increase the supply of other resources, discover alternatives to overused resources, and improve efficiency of resource use.17 Recent research has found evidence supporting Simon’s view, showing that every 1 percent increase in population is associated with commodity prices falling by around 1 percent.18 In other words, each additional person helps to decrease resource scarcity on average, suggesting that humans, when free to innovate and engage in market exchange, tend to be net creators rather than net destroyers.



Also, evidence shows that as countries grow richer and children’s odds of survival improve, couples tend to choose to have smaller families without being forced to do so. (Contrastingly, parents faced with high rates of infant mortality in their communities tend to have large families in part as a strategy to improve their odds of having at least some surviving children.) This phenomenon is called the “fertility transition.” Today even in sub‐​Saharan Africa, the world’s poorest region, birth rates are falling voluntarily.19 The global population is projected to decline in the long run.20



Yet many people remain convinced that overpopulation is an urgent problem necessitating government intervention, so it is worthwhile to detail some of the consequences of neo‐​Malthusian ideas. This paper focuses on the world’s two most populous countries, China and India, which together hold roughly 40 percent of the world’s population and are where neo‐​Malthusianism has arguably caused the most suffering.



While neo‐​Malthusian human rights abuses peaked with China’s one‐​child policy and India’s Emergency, problematic policies continue today. In both countries, neo‐​Malthusian policies have contributed to higher rates of sex‐​selective abortion and infanticide. China has the world’s most imbalanced sex ratio at birth, resulting in 30 million more men than women, and India has the world’s fourth most imbalanced ratio despite government and private efforts to combat sex‐​selective abortion.21 China and India have contributed to a _worldwide_ lopsided sex ratio at birth of 107 boys per 100 girls and to over 160 million “missing” women globally.22 (The natural sex ratio at birth, when unaltered by sex‐​selective abortion or infanticide, is on average 105 boys born for every for every 100 girls.23)



Cases of coercion, such as during the one‐​child policy and Emergency, alone are sufficient reason to oppose neo‐​Malthusianism. By documenting the extent of penalties and coercion, this paper seeks to demonstrate the grave importance of combating the resurgence of the neo‐​Malthusian mentality.



In 1798, English clergyman Thomas Robert Malthus published _An Essay on the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society_ , warning that out‐​of‐​control population growth would deplete resources and bring widespread famine. His preferred solution was to decrease birth rates by delaying marriage, but if that proved insufficient, he endorsed extreme measures to slash population growth. To prevent famine, he thought it morally permissible to “court the return of the plague” by having the poor live in swamps and even entertained the idea of banning “specific remedies for ravaging diseases.”24



Malthus’s disregard for the welfare of the poor, in the name of slowing population growth, would prove an enduring part of overpopulation alarmism.



After Malthus died, the Industrial Revolution transformed Western society. It created unprecedented prosperity. Food became more plentiful even as the population grew. Malthusianism seemed disproven. Moreover, increased wealth led to more funding for sanitation, hospitals, and education and a decline in child mortality. That allowed for smaller family sizes and resulted in a decline in fertility.



In the early 20th century, as mortality rates among the poor declined, the pseudoscientific “eugenics” movement emerged. It sought to prevent allegedly inferior people from reproducing. Roughly 70,000 people were forcibly sterilized in the 20th century under eugenic legislation in the United States alone.25 Eugenicists and Malthusians often allied in policymaking, as they both believed that childbearing should be limited for people they deemed undeserving.26



In 1952, population control and family planning activist Margaret Sanger, who was motivated by both eugenics (see her 1920 book, _Women and the New Race_ ) and Malthusianism, gave an address in Mumbai.27 In her speech she claimed that Mahatma Gandhi, the man who led India’s successful campaign for independence from British rule, once told her that he supported limiting couples to four children to combat “overpopulation.” She opined:



As population increases in any given territory, it encroaches upon all natural resources… . _Parenthood should be considered a privilege, not a right_ … . Those who do not have the individual initiative and intelligence to plan and control the size of their families should be assisted, guided, and directed in every way to eliminate the undesirable offspring, who usually contribute nothing to our civilization but use up the energy and resources of the world.28



The year she gave that address, Sanger founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), a global nongovernmental family planning organization that went on to provide technical assistance to China’s coercive one‐​child program.



The 1960s and 1970s saw rapid global population growth as economic development and the spread of medicine and scientific knowledge lowered mortality rates. During that time, Malthus’s view became resurgent, replacing eugenics as the primary motivation behind population control policies. In 1960, world population reached 3 billion. By 1975, it reached 4 billion. Rich countries’ governments started to fear that poor countries’ burgeoning populations would deplete the world’s limited resources, according to development economist Betsy Hartmann of Hampshire College.29 Neo‐​Malthusianism was born.



As early as 1959, the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations recommended that aid be given to “developing countries who establish programs to check population growth.”30 In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson made U.S. foreign aid dependent on countries adopting population control policies.31 In 1967, Congress allocated $35 million via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for “population programs.” In 1969, President Richard Nixon established the Office of Population within USAID that was dedicated to population control and had a $50 million annual budget.32 In 1977, the head of that office, Reimert Ravenholt, said he hoped to sterilize a quarter of the world’s women.33 The World Bank also made aid contingent on population control, embracing “explicit demographic goals.”34



In 1968, Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich published _The Population Bomb_ , a bestseller claiming that without population control the world would run out of food, fresh water, and other resources and predicting mass starvation in the 1970s.35 That year, a representative of the Ford Foundation, a prominent American charity, came out in favor of mandatory “sterilization after an allowable number of births.”36 Also in 1968, a group of academics, politicians, and businesspeople formed the Club of Rome to focus on environmental problems. In 1972, the organization published an influential report, _The Limits to Growth_ , that warned population growth could deplete resources and lead to a “collapse” of global society.37 The warning was based on computer simulations relying on dubious assumptions.



In 1969, the UN launched the UNFPA, which promoted the view that population growth was at the root of environmental problems and poverty, blaming the world’s poorest people in particular. The “bottom billion often impose greater environmental injury than” all the other people “put together,” the UNFPA said in 1992.38 Increasingly prominent neo‐​Malthusians “spoke of a war on population growth,” notes Matthew Connelly, a historian at Columbia University.39 “The war would entail sacrifices, and collateral damage,” Connelly wrote. “Poor countries were pressed to accept population programs and rich countries were expected to pay for them.”40



By the early 1970s, USAID contributed over half the budget of the IPPF and UNFPA and contributed substantial amounts to the Population Council and similarly minded groups.41



Facing pressure from officials in international organizations and rich countries who prioritized the “wooing of national elites” in developing countries to their cause (through concerted campaigns and generous funding), many policymakers in poor countries came around to the view that population growth caused resource scarcity.42 Between 1976 and 1996 neo‐​Malthusian sentiments became more widespread, and the number of governments viewing their citizenry’s fertility levels as “too high” increased from 55 to 87.43 Over the same period, the number of governments pursuing policies to lower the rate of population growth grew from 39 to 71.44 Overwhelmingly, it was poor countries that were expected to curb their populations (see Table 1).



The increasingly popular goal of lowering the population justified coercive policies in the minds of some scholars. In 1970, ecologist Garrett Hardin opined at a meeting convened by the Population Council, “It would be much easier if we have a persuasive campaign first to prepare the way for coercion later.” By 1978, in a survey of Population Association of America members, 34 percent of respondents agreed that “coercive birth control programs should be initiated in at least some countries immediately.”45



By the 1980s, the background document to the International Conference on Family Planning, cowritten by the UNFPA, IPPF, and Population Council, decreed, “When provision of contraceptive information and services does not bring down the fertility level quickly enough to help speed up development, governments may decide to _limit the freedom_ of choice of the present generation.”46 Many people saw coercion as acceptable because the overpopulation problem was deemed so urgent.



In a 1991 interview with the _UNESCO Courier_ , the famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau opined that humanity should not try to cure diseases because population “must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.”47 In 1994, at its International Conference on Population and Development, the UN declared that “intensified efforts” were “crucial” to “stabilization of the world population.” In 2002, the UNFPA stated its mission to be “the universally accepted aim of stabilizing world population” to protect “the natural resources on which all life depends,” but its use of the word “stabilization” was misleading because it was a euphemism for _lowering_ the population. Nafis Sadik, a former executive director of the UNFPA, clarified that stabilization meant “stabilization of world population at the lowest possible level, within the shortest period of time.” Groups that declared commitment to stabilizing the population included the Sierra Club, an environmental organization, as well as charitable foundations such as the Ford Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Packard Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.48



The prevalence of neo‐​Malthusian doctrine among international organizations, government leaders, and philanthropies became widespread. Through these groups, neo‐​Malthusians exerted moral pressure, sought converts to their cause, and offered financial incentives, rewarding governments in poor countries that enacted population control measures while sounding no alarms if those measures became coercive.



The results were catastrophic. Consider China and India.



In a Helsinki pub in 1978, a Dutch professor, Geert Jan Olsder, and a Chinese mathematician, Song Jian, sat down together for a beer. Olsder mentioned the Club of Rome’s _Limits to Growth_ report and ignited a “messianic fervor” for population control in Jian that would shape China’s future.49 “His eyes lit up,” recalled Olsder, who maintained that “all things equal, [the world] should do the same [as China] and have a one‐​child policy.”50



“During a visit to Europe in 1978, I happened to learn about the application of systems analysis by European scientists to the study of population problems with a great success,” Jian wrote of the encounter, “I was extremely excited … and determined to try the method.”51 He did not stop at _Limits to Growth_. He also read Malthus: “When I was thinking about this, I took Malthus’s book to research the study of population.”52



 _Limits to Growth_ not only promoted Malthus’s idea that a large population creates resource scarcity, but it also promoted the notion that planners could use “systems analysis,” meaning mathematical procedures, to compute a country’s sustainable population size. In 1978, Jian calculated that China’s “ideal” population was between 650 million and 700 million people—or 280 million to 330 million fewer than its population at the time.53



Jian translated the Club of Rome’s central arguments, but none of the circulating critiques of the Club of Rome’s methodology, into Mandarin. He also published his own findings inspired by the Club of Rome’s approach. Jian was highly respected for previous work on ballistic missiles, and he soon persuaded China’s elite of an urgent population crisis necessitating forceful population control. Harvard University anthropologist Susan Greenhalgh’s book _Just One Child: Science and Policy in Deng’s China_ , chronicles Jian’s successful campaign to spread neo‐​Malthusian fears among China’s elite despite opposition from rival government factions.



Population control became an integral part of the country’s “socialist modernization” efforts, culminating in the one‐​child policy. Thus, the neo‐​Malthusian “crisis mentality and the top‐​down, engineering‐​type solutions to the crisis made their way to China,” Greenhalgh wrote.54



Not only was the intellectual impetus for China’s coercive population control policies decidedly neo‐​Malthusian, but organizations such as the UNFPA and IPPF provided support for the one‐​child policy. The UNFPA opened an office in Beijing in 1979 and pledged $50 million for population policy in China over the next four years. It stipulated that the money was in part to fund training for 70,000 family planning workers and an extensive campaign promoting smaller family sizes.55 The Chinese state‐​run association responsible for implementing the one‐​child policy became an IPPF member in 1983.56



International support for the one‐​child policy consisted of both intellectual and moral encouragement as well as financial support that, even when not ostensibly funding coercion, freed resources to support the one‐​child policy. For example, every dollar in aid money spent on training family planning workers or on educational campaigns freed Chinese funds that could go toward nonconsensual procedures. UNFPA grants went to training and equipping the people who would go on to carry out coerced procedures. The UNFPA also paid for many of the computers used to calculate birth quotas.57 Chinese funds that would otherwise have gone to buying computers or teaching family planning workers how to perform abortions and sterilizations were thus made available to fund the one‐​child policy’s enforcement, including the collection of fines and performing coerced abortions and forced sterilizations.



When the minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China became one of the inaugural recipients of the UNFPA Population Award in 1983, he said in his acceptance speech that it was “a symbol of the support and encouragement given by the United Nations to China’s family planning program.”58



Then UN Secretary‐​General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar similarly emphasized the UN’s role in helping to mobilize China’s and India’s population control policies. In his speech bestowing the first Population Award, Pérez de Cuéllar said: “The eminent laureates are making a moving acknowledgment of the bonds of common endeavor between their countries and our Organization… . Thanks to international cooperation mobilized by the United Nations, world population growth is slowing.”59



Many in advanced Western countries heaped praise on the one‐​child policy and ignored charges of coercion. “Population experts have praised the program” of the one‐​child policy, noted a 1988 article in the U.S.-based _Journal of Public Health Policy_.60 In 1989, Sadik, then the executive director of the UNFPA, insisted that the Chinese program was “totally voluntary.”61



Even after the turn of the millennium, China continued to receive encouragement from some neo‐​Malthusians in the West for the one‐​child policy. In 2002, Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, then executive director of the UNFPA, praised China’s one‐​child policy, saying, “China, having adopted practical measures in accordance with her current situation, has scored remarkable achievements in population control. In recent years, the UNFPA and China have carried out a series of favorable and positive cooperation.”62



As recently as 2018, New York University law professor Dan Guttman told _Harvard Political Review_ : “With the One‐​Child Policy, China put into effect the single most effective climate change rule in the world… . If you have hundreds of millions of less people [sic], you have that much less resource use.”63



Thus, neo‐​Malthusian doctrine—aided by Jian’s conversion to such thinking and bolstered by moral encouragement and financial support from Western organizations—created and sustained China’s one‐​child policy.



The Chinese government estimates that its one‐​child policy prevented some 400 million births. However, that is disputed; the true number may be lower because China may have experienced the sharp decline in birth rates seen in most countries as they develop economically.64



The policy was first introduced in 1979 and rolled out officially in 1980. It became stricter in the 1990s. However, the exact level of strictness fluctuated. Periods of strict enforcement were called “campaigns” or “shock months” or “shock attacks.”65 For example, 1983 was a particularly strict year for sterilizations (see Figure 1). Not only did the policy’s strictness change over time, but its details varied by locality starting in 1984, when enforcement was decentralized. Afterward, exemptions to the one‐​child policy proliferated, such as some counties allowing rural families a second child.66



While the policy’s enforcement and details varied based on time and place, the policy limited most couples to a single child.



Local administrators faced wage deductions, demotions, or dismissal if their locality failed to follow the one‐​birth‐​per‐​couple quota and received large pay bonuses for performing more abortions and sterilizations.67 Some family planning officials showed lenience out of kindness or in exchange for bribes, but coercion and violence were frequent. In 1981, noncompliant women in Guangdong had their water and electricity cut off.68 “As long as we kept the quotas, we could do anything: destroy homes, property, jail people, even threaten to confiscate people’s children,” one official in Sichuan claimed.69



Single parenthood was illegal, and married couples had to apply for a birth permit before conceiving. In some areas, women could be punished for “not using contraception” even if it did not result in pregnancy and for unwed cohabitation. Women of childbearing age had to undergo periodic mandatory pregnancy tests. In Jiangsu province, women were forced to line up and publicly take urine pregnancy tests twice a month.70



China’s women found some creative ways to overcome the restrictions. One single mother, whose boyfriend died in a car crash when she was four months pregnant, married a gay male friend (and divorced him after she gave birth) so that she could keep her government job without terminating her pregnancy.71 Many mothers had two children in quick succession under the same birth permit, lying that the children were twins. Some women used fertility drugs to improve their odds of birthing twins. China’s one‐​child policy accounts for at least a third of China’s rise in the number of twin births (the rest are a result of later childbearing, as older mothers are more likely to conceive twins).72



China bans medical professionals from assisting with birth surrogacy, a practice that some used to evade the one‐​child policy. In 2009, three surrogate mothers were arrested in Guangzhou and forced to have abortions.73



 **Coerced IUDs, Sterilizations, and Abortions.** In the 1980s, China began mandating that women, after having one child, be fitted with intrauterine devices (IUDs) that are modified to be irremovable without major surgery and be surgically sterilized if they managed to have two children. Many Chinese women considered surgical sterilization “a feared and painful procedure.”74 The most recent UN figures (2017) show that 18.3 percent of Chinese women aged 15–49 had been permanently sterilized and that 34.1 percent had an IUD.75 In comparison, in Hong Kong, where there are no limits on childbearing, only 3.5 percent of women aged 15–49 were permanently sterilized in 2012, the most recent year for which there is data.76



IUDs are typically only effective for a decade, but in China they are effective until menopause and designed to remain implanted indefinitely. In China, women with IUDs are subjected to periodic x‐​rays to ensure the device’s coil is still in place.77 From 1980 to 2014, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with modified IUDs, and 107 million underwent tubal ligation—surgical sterilization—or got their “tubes tied.”78 That averages to 9.5 million modified IUDs and over 3 million tubal ligations annually. Those often occurred without screening for contraindications (conditions or factors suggesting the procedure should not be used because it may be harmful to the patient) or basic health standards.79 As Greenhalgh put it: “The more children a woman succeeded in having, the more likely she was to be labeled a troublemaker and targeted for surgery.”80



As recently as 2010, China held a mass sterilization campaign for close to 10,000 people and detained almost 1,400 relatives of the couples targeted for sterilization to pressure the couples into undergoing the procedure.81



One woman with two children fled her home to avoid a mandated tubal ligation. The family planning team arrived at her house to find only the elderly grandmother of the escaped family. The officials tore down the dwelling, “making the house vanish in just 20 minutes,” a member of the team who now regrets his role in the demolition said. “I told the official in charge, ‘This is too ruthless,’” recalls the former team member. “He replied: ‘It’s policy.’”82



Those who violated the one‐​child policy also faced “excess birth” fines, which were rebranded as “social compensation fees” in 2000. The fines amounted to up to 10 times families’ annual disposable income. In 2013, China collected at least $2.7 billion in these fines.83 By 2015, the last year of the one‐​child policy, approximately 5 percent (800,000) of China’s newborns were third‐​born children in violation of family planning policies whose parents thus incurred fines.84 Since 1990, the average Chinese woman has fewer children than she says would be ideal.85



The poor were often least able to afford the fines. It took some rural families years to pay the fine for a single over‐​quota birth. There are accounts of families selling all their furniture and even their house’s front door to pay the fine.86 “If the couple is too poor to pay, we’ll take things from their house,” explained Huang Denggao, who enforced the population control policy in one village. He would send a team of about 10 enforcers, all “strong healthy young men,” to conduct the pillaging. “If they couldn’t pay, you would confiscate some things of value in the home,” recalled a different former administrator. “Sometimes, we would climb up the roofs and make a hole, to show we meant business, or knock down some windows,” he noted.87



Well over 300 million abortions took place in China over the course of the one‐​child policy, an unknown share of which were coerced.88 In the early years of the policy, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported, some women were “handcuffed, tied with ropes” and sent for forced abortions.89 China bans abortion after six months of pregnancy, but officials often coerced late‐​term abortions past that point without repercussions.90 One former family planning official estimates that she carried out 1,500 abortions, about a third of which were late‐​term.91 A study of Chinese villages found that one in four women who married in the 1970s had an abortion by 1987 and that one in eight had a second‐ or third‐​trimester abortion.92



Consider the firsthand account of Wang Liping, who underwent a forced abortion in 2005 when she was seven months pregnant:



I was stopped by a couple of people on the street… . They asked me to go with them. They … beat me up and dragged me to the … [h]ospital, and forcibly induced labor on me without any examination or my signature… . They and some doctors and nurses pushed me onto the ground… . Then they injected some medicine at my fetus’ location in my belly, and then they roped me onto a sickbed. I could not resist this and nobody came to help me.93



She continued: “My almost‐​fully‐​developed child was born. My child even mournfully cried for some minutes, and later the crying ceased.” The hospital demanded payment for the unwanted procedure.



“I was crying,” Xiao Hong recalls of her forced abortion in 2009 in Guangzhou. “I don’t want to do this,” she told the officials. “But they still dragged me in and injected my belly with a needle,” she recalled.94 She was four months pregnant with twins.



In cases where a coerced late‐​term abortion failed and resulted in a live birth, the unofficial policy was to kill the newborn. One former family planning official recalls skirting the rule: “I would secretly wrap them up and give them to the fathers. I told them to put the child in their bags, as if it was a thing, not a baby, and not to open the bag when they left, so they could get away.”95



Many parents were not so lucky. In 1990, Mao Hengfeng was seven and a half months pregnant when family planning officials restrained her and forcibly injected her with a labor‐​inducing drug. To their surprise, she gave birth to a live child. “The baby was alive; I could hear the baby cry,” Hengfeng claimed. The family planning officials drowned the newborn in a bucket before the mother’s eyes. “They killed my baby … yet I couldn’t do a thing.”96 There are other such accounts of newborn‐​drowning from the 1990s.97



The procedure for failed coerced abortion remained similar over the years. Consider a case from 2011. “They grabbed my wife’s body like they were grabbing a pig, four or five people holding her hands and legs and head, and injected a shot into her belly,” one man recalled to the _Washington Post_ , requesting anonymity.98 The drug failed, and hours after the injection, his seven‐​months‐​pregnant wife gave birth to a living boy, wriggling and crying. The family planning officials refused to let the new parents hold their infant, instead wrapping the newborn boy in a plastic bag. They had him buried on a nearby hill.



 **“Black Children,” Adoption, and Trafficking.** Those who managed to evade coerced abortion gave birth to illegal children known as over‐​quota or out‐​of‐​plan children, popularly called _heihaizi_ or “black children.” Such children lack government registration or _hukou_ , a document needed to attend school, work, marry, and receive a birth permit. There are some 13 million unregistered persons in China.99



The unregistered either must obtain registration with false identities, bribes, personal connections, or the paying of exorbitant fines or else live on the margins of society. Periodic amnesties and registration drives have allowed some to gain registration, but the process is often Kafkaesque. After a 2008 reform to encourage registration, one man spent about three years and $7,000 without success trying to complete paperwork, police interviews, a DNA test, and other ordeals to obtain a _hukou_ for his adopted daughter so that she could attend kindergarten.100



The one‐​child policy also caused a surge in child abandonment and adoption.



Many Chinese gave over‐​quota children to relatives or neighbors following customary adoption practices: a workaround that family planning officials progressively sought to stamp out. In 1991, a national adoption law “codified the regulations used by birth planning officials to prevent and punish people for using adoption to circulate and hide out‐​of‐​plan births,” by making it illegal to give up a healthy child for adoption. It also made it illegal to adopt a child except for those who were both childless and over 35 (lowered to 30 in 1999).101



“Targeted abandonment” emerged, resulting in hundreds of thousands of children being secretly adopted against the law. Parents would leave an over‐​quota child in a basket at night at the doorstep of a family known to want a child. The “abandoners” would set off firecrackers and hide, watching to ensure that the “abandoned” child was taken inside. “Strategic abandonment,” another way of giving children up for adoption, also arose. That involved leaving an infant in a basket filled with baby supplies at a well‐​frequented outdoor location, where someone would soon notice the “abandoned” child. (Secretly arranging adoptions more directly risked punishment by the government, which sometimes labeled such arrangements as child trafficking.) Some staged abandonments took place as recently as 2011.102



Many adoptive families did not meet the restrictive legal criteria for adoption and struggled to keep the child and obtain a hukou. As part of its efforts to quash local adoption, the Chinese government seized many wanted children, placed them in overcrowded orphanages, and promoted international adoption. It was “widely understood” that such seizures were unlikely to be punished.103 International adoptions grew from a few hundred children a year in the early 1990s to a peak of 14,000 children in 2005. More than 120,000 Chinese children were adopted internationally during the one‐​child policy.104



International adoption became lucrative for state‐​run orphanages thanks to the adoption fees. As a result, many over‐​quota children were abducted from birth parents who could not afford the fine and then subsequently adopted out internationally. According to one Hunan villager, birth planning officials used to smash houses to punish noncompliance, but “after [the year] 2000 they haven’t smashed houses. They abduct children.”105



 **Female Infanticide, Sex‐​Selective Abortion, and Skewed Sex Ratio.** Despite the proliferation of targeted and strategic aban­donments, cases of reckless abandonment also swelled. Most abandoned children were girls.



Female infanticide and sex‐​selective abortion are estimated to have caused 50 million “missing” Chinese women.106 Although both female infanticide and sex‐​selective abortion are illegal in China, which instituted stiff penalties for ultrasound sex determination in the 2000s, birth limits have encouraged both practices given a cultural preference for sons over daughters.107 Chinese cultural preference for sons predates the one‐​child policy, and some Chinese immigrant communities in the United States practice sex‐​selective abortion.108 However, the sex ratio became more skewed in areas of China with stricter enforcement of the one‐​child rule than in counties that gave exemptions allowing more families to have a second child. The bribe to an ultrasound technician for prenatal sex determination was around 10 times cheaper than the fine for an over‐​quota child.109



The one‐​child policy helped destabilize China’s sex ratio at birth, which peaked at 121 boys per 100 girls in 2004. It was still at an extreme 119 boys per 100 girls at the time the policy softened to a two‐​child rule in 2016. This imbalance has left many Chinese men without hope of finding a Chinese wife. These men have been labeled “bare branches” because they are seen as dead ends on their family trees. One 2013 study suggested that compared to China’s married men, the nation’s numerous bachelors suffer from higher rates of depression and aggression.110 In 2008, an economic study showed that every 1 percent increase in China’s sex ratio resulted in a 5–6 percent increase in violent and property crime.111



The sex ratio imbalance in China varies substantially. In Tianmen, Hubei, in 2007 there were 176 boys for every 100 girls under age 4.112 Contrastingly, the natural sex ratio at birth, when unaltered by sex‐​selective abortion or infanticide, is on average 105 boys born for every 100 girls.113



Following a big population jump revealed in its 1962 census, India became one of the pioneers of population control in developing countries.114 As neo‐​Malthusianism gained popularity among elected officials in the U.S. government and in international organizations, it inspired those officials to support India in its population control efforts.



The campaign to spread neo‐​Malthusian ideas among India’s policymakers long preceded the Emergency’s forced sterilizations. From the United States, both the Johnson and the Ford administrations encouraged India’s Prime Minister Gandhi to pursue population control more aggressively.115



A now declassified U.S. National Security Council memorandum from 1974 by then secretary of state Henry Kissinger makes explicit the U.S. “aim … for the world to achieve … a two‐​child family on the average … by about the year 2000” and identifies India as a “key country” that the United States, through aid and through UN agencies, should “assist” with the goal of “population moderation.” The memorandum urges “explicit consideration” of “mandatory programs.”116



The memorandum claims that population control is needed to prevent “Malthusian conditions for many regions of the world” and “classic Malthusian cases with famines involving millions of people.” The report quotes the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi claiming that in India “Malthusian pressures are already being felt.”117



Western population professionals thronged to India’s capital in the 1960s, backing surveys, doling out research grants, proselytizing neo‐​Malthusianism, and training many of India’s demographers, doctors, and public health professionals. In conjunction with India’s elite, Western organizations helped design and bankroll policies, such as sterilization targets, aimed at curbing the fertility of the country’s poor.118



By the 1960s, the U.S. government, UNFPA, Ford Foundation, and World Bank accounted for most of the $1.5 billion in annual aid that India received. In 1974, the UNFPA issued its largest grant ever to India, and in 1976 the Swedish Development Authority loaned India $60 million for “family planning,” some of which ultimately funded coerced procedures. Between 1972 and 1980 the World Bank loaned India $66 million for “population control.”119 Upon returning from a visit to India in 1976 during the Emergency, then World Bank president Robert McNamara declared, “At long last, India is moving to effectively address its population problem,” noting without alarm coercive policies including, in his words, “compulsory abortion” and “sterilization laws.”120



The Population Council sent Sheldon Segal, the head of its biomedical division, to New Delhi, where he served as personal adviser to Indian Armed Forces Lt. Col. B. L. Raina, India’s director of family planning. In 1969, the former advocated sex‐​selective abortion as a means of population control despite no political support for it at the time. The Ford Foundation soon allocated $63,563 to the All‐​India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), a prestigious public medical college, on top of earlier grants of $1.7 million and Rockefeller Foundation grants of $1.5 million. In 1975, AIIMS presented research that advanced sex‐​selective abortion as a means of population control, and there are reports of doctors encouraging pregnant patients to abort female fetuses because “population control was deemed so urgent.”121



The Western‐​funded research stated, “In India cultural and economic factors make the parents desire a son, and in many instances the couple keeps on reproducing just to have a son. Prenatal determination of sex would put an end to this unnecessary fecundity. There is of course the tendency to abort the fetus if it is female.” Outrage among India’s feminists led to the banning of prenatal sex determination at state hospitals in 1978.122 It was banned entirely in 1994.



When Gandhi declared the Emergency and suspended civil liberties, her son Sanjay—although he held no official title and his power was largely unconstitutional—seized the opportunity to embark on a compulsory sterilization program to fight “overpopulation.”123 He ignored the fact that this policy violated Indian law.



Gandhi, in her acceptance statement for the UNFPA Population Award in 1983, gushed that the family planning officials of her nation “will be encouraged that this world body has recognized India’s efforts in one of the most difficult areas of social engineering.”124



She also said, regarding the birth rate, “The goal is to reduce the national average [from 35 per thousand] to 21 per thousand by the year 2000. The task is not easy. Millions of couples, many of them illiterate, must be persuaded.”125 That number is revealing because it shows that her goal was to reach the target birth rate that professional population planners deemed appropriate. While she said that she favored using persuasion to attain this goal, the suspension of civil liberties and censorship during the Emergency meant that her son Sanjay Gandhi was able to force officials to conduct compulsory sterilizations with no legal authorization. Public outrage over the policy contributed to a stunning electoral defeat for Indira Gandhi in 1977. She returned to power in 1980, when the Janata coalition that defeated her in 1977 proved unstable, but when she returned she stated that she had never authorized coercion, and coerced sterilizations came to be widely seen as an excess of the Emergency.126



During the Emergency, some 11 million Indians were sterilized, and an additional 1 million women were fitted with IUDs (see Figure 2).127 An astonishing 6.2 million Indians were sterilized in 1976 alone—1.7 million in September.128 Some 2,000 Indians died from botched operations.129 Demographer and economic analyst Ashish Bose estimated that massively increased sterilization targets and coercive tactics accounted for approximately 7 million undesired sterilizations.130 By late 1973, there were already 14.3 million sterilized persons in India.131



Sanjay Gandhi spearheaded the Emergency’s mass sterilization campaign. Young and ambitious, he wished to bolster his image by implementing a national program. For his focus he chose four policies, one of which was “Family Planning—for a prosperous future.”132 He massively increased sterilization targets, particularly for the high birth rate states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan.133 The majority of the victims of forced sterilization during the Emergency were men.



Some positive monetary incentives were offered to encourage sterilization, but negative incentives also flourished.134 In Madhya Pradesh, irrigation water was withheld from village fields unless sterilization quotas were met. Teachers in Uttar Pradesh had to submit to sterilization or forfeit a month’s salary, and health and family planning workers in that state had pay withheld until they met sterilization quotas.135 In one incident in Uttar Pradesh, officials seized a man’s buffaloes and threatened to take his land and house if he did not get sterilized.136 In 1976, Maharashtra state mandated sterilization for couples with more than two children (although that was poorly enforced).137 Accounts abound of state hospitals refusing to treat unsterilized patients and of patients undergoing treatment for unrelated illnesses being sterilized without being informed.138



“If some excesses appear, don’t blame me,” explained the director of family planning in Mumbai. “You must consider it something like a war. There could be a certain amount of misfiring out of enthusiasm. There has been pressure to show results. Whether you like it or not, there will be a few dead people.”139



The schools acted as well. A professor in New Delhi recalls: “In the Emergency, the pressure was on all teachers to get operated and produce cases [of sterilization] from their students. The government [would] withdraw their salaries if they did not agree.” A man who was still a student during the Emergency recalled: “In schools they used to make announcements that those whose parents did not get sterilized would not pass exams… . The Sanskrit master went to my father and told him to go for the operation or else he would fail me and my studies would be ruined.” His father refused at first but eventually relented. “All those whose parents had got sterilized were passed and all those whose parents had refused were failed,” the son remembered.140



To meet the high targets, many officials resorted to coercion with police assistance. “People were rounded up at random, from the streets, the tea shop, the bazaars, and taken to the family planning camps to be sterilized… . They would grab people by force, take them into the tent, make them sign papers,” one witness recalled. “If the police get you, you can’t do much.” Some people resorted to hiding in forests or sugarcane fields to avoid the police and forced sterilization.141



“In those days they would take you to the camp, ask how many children you had, then ignore it and sterilize you anyway,” claimed a different witness. “This sort of thing happened mostly in crowded places and main roads. In fact my employer even advised me to stay indoors as much as possible.”142



Through the denial of permits, government officials pressured private businesses to help the sterilization drives. A factory worker recalls, “My boss told me to get sterilized so that he could get the license” to operate his business, which had been made contingent on sterilization of employees.143



Preoccupation with meeting sterilization targets, rather than actual reduction of birth rates, often made public health workers indifferent to the age, fecundity, and other characteristics of those sterilized. Among the victims of forced sterilization during the Emergency were young people, childless people, people past their reproductive years, people whose spouses had been sterilized, hospital patients, jail inmates, and homeless people.144 There are even accounts of sterilized people undergoing the procedure for a second time.145



During the Emergency’s beautification drives, “slum” neighborhoods were razed and an estimated 700,000 people were displaced. Granting of new housing plots for the displaced was contingent upon sterilization, forcing people whose homes the government destroyed to choose between sterilization and homelessness. It was also possible to obtain housing plots by “motivating others” to undertake sterilization (usually with a bribe), thus sparing oneself. In an area in Delhi known as Turkmen’s Gate, local resistance to the sterilization drive and demolitions resulted in authorities killing at least 12 resisters, with some sources estimating a much higher death toll.146



Those who obtained new plots without sterilization often faced eviction. As one man put it: “It was impossible to live here without getting sterilized because you would be evicted. Nobody liked the idea of sterilization. But people didn’t have any choice.”147

While the worst human rights abuses of neo‐​Malthusianism are in the past, troubling policies inspired by those ideas persist. China and, to a much lesser extent, India continue to provide examples.



China relaxed its one‐​child policy into a two‐​child policy in 2016 and now encourages married couples to have a second child, but having three or more children is still illegal. In some provinces, women must still undergo periodic state‐​mandated pregnancy tests, would‐​be parents must seek birth permits, and single motherhood remains illegal. Those who fail to comply may face exorbitant fines, job termination, detention, coerced sterilization, or coerced abortion. While a far cry from the abuses of the past, even in democratic India half the country’s population lives in states that penalize families with more than two children, and political representation is apportioned in a way that punishes states with high birth rates.



China has continued to limit family sizes through violence in recent years. In 2012, a case of forced abortion in China garnered international attention. It involved a woman who could not afford the fine for a second child and so was physically restrained and injected with an abortifacient when she was seven months pregnant.148 Graphic photographs of the incident went viral on the website Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, sparking widespread outrage.



Commenting on the event, Weibo’s chief editor Hu Xijin wrote, “I strongly oppose the barbarous forced abortion,” but he maintained that overall the one‐​child policy was positive, writing, “the world resources cannot afford to feed a China with billions of people.”149 His words echoed the neo‐​Malthusian reasoning behind China’s family size limits.



So did a _Global Times_ op‐​ed about the incident. The English‐​language Chinese newspaper (under the control of the state‐​run _People’s Daily_ ) concluded, “China’s 1.3 billion population is competing for global resources. The world cannot afford a larger China… . forced termination of late‐​term pregnancies must be condemned and banned. But it shouldn’t be a reason for refuting the whole policy, which has freed China from the burden of an extra 400 million people.”150



Although China has since relaxed its one‐​child policy to a two‐​child policy, coercion still occurs. The two‐​child policy was passed into law in December 2015 and went into effect on the first day of 2016. Some pregnant women reportedly attempted to postpone the delivery of their second child until after January 1, 2016, to avoid paying fines.151 The softening of the policy occurred despite backroom lobbying by former state counselor Song Jian, whose _Limits to Growth_ -inspired models formed the basis of the one‐​child policy. Still, Jian delayed the reform for over a decade. (Jian’s views remained unwavering: in a 2011 essay, he called zero population growth “the ultimate goal of human society.”) High‐​ranking reformers had been trying to overturn the one‐​child policy since at least the year 2000.152



The remaining limitations that the two‐​child policy impose are still justified in neo‐​Malthusian terms. “The tensions between population and resources and environment will not fundamentally change,” noted China’s State Council in its national population development plan for 2016–2030, released in 2017. The plan specifies, according to state‐​run news agency _Xinhua_ , that the government must continue to implement the “two‐​child policy to promote balanced population development.”153



The option of a second child came too late for many. Of the approximately 90 million women of reproductive age with a previous delivery who newly qualified for a second birth, half were over the age of 40. And 60 percent were over the age of 35, when female fertility sharply declines.154



Much reporting on China now refers to travesties, such as forced abortions, in the past tense, as though they occurred only under the one‐​child policy, but that is inaccurate.155 Families with three or more children still must pay a “social compensation fee,” which can reach 10 times a person’s annual disposable income. In 2018, some provinces still fined women who failed to undergo periodic state‐​mandated pregnancy tests even if they were not pregnant. Couples in some provinces were required to seek approval and register before a child was even conceived.156 Many local governments have systems in place to monetarily reward those who report illegal births.157



Unmarried women are still not allowed even one child in many counties. Unwed Chinese mothers must marry within 60 days of a child’s birth or pay the “social compensation fee.” Those who fail to comply with family size limits may also face job termination or detention. However, the most egregious forms of coercion fall into two broad categories: coerced sterilization and coerced abortion.



It is difficult to quantify the extent of human rights abuses, but a government report from Hunan province indicated that county authorities had carried out 19 sterilizations and 67 abortions just in the winter of 2017 and collected nearly 2.76 million yuan (approximately $437,000 U.S. dollars) in ‘‘social compensation fees.”158 In February 2019, one couple in Chengwu county, Shandong province, who could not afford a fine of $9,570 for violating family planning regulations had their life savings (around $3,000) seized.159



 **Coerced Abortion in China Today.** In 2016, China had an abortion rate of about 28 per 1,000 women aged 15–49. That was more than double the abortion rate for the United States in 2015, which was 12 per 1,000 women aged 15–44. There were over 9 million abortions in China in 2016 after the two‐​child policy replaced the one‐​child policy. That figure shows no meaningful decline from the figures for 2015 and 2014, when the one‐​child policy was still in effect (see Figure 3).160



An unknown share of those abortions were coerced. The U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018 found “coerced abortions and sterilizations” continue under China’s revised Population and Family Planning Law. The report relates that forced abortions were carried out in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Liaoning and that forced abortion protocols remained on the books in Guizhou and Yunnan.161



Migrant workers may be particularly vulnerable. The U.S. report claimed, “In localities with large populations of migrant workers, officials specifically targeted migrant women to ensure they did not exceed birth limitations.”162



China “continued to enforce compliance with family planning policies using methods including heavy fines, job termination, detention, and abortion,” according to the U.S. Congressional‐​Executive Commission on China’s 2018 report. The 2019 report had similar findings: “Chinese authorities threatened or imposed punishments on families for illegal pregnancies and births, using methods including heavy fines, job termination, and abortion.”163



Also noted in the 2018 report are official statements from local government authorities that women are compelled to undergo the “four procedures” (IUD insertion, sterilization, first trimester abortion, and mid‐ to late‐​term abortion) in Gu County in Shanxi province, Guichi District in Anhui province, Yunyang District in Hubei province, Wolong District in Henan province, and Dongshahe Township in Shandong province. The 2019 report notes that in Dalu township in Hainan province, local authorities carried out 264 of the “four procedures” in 2018 and that local authorities had a success rate of 83 percent in detecting pregnancies within the first six months of the gestation period and reached 100.5 percent of their family planning work targets.164



The _Wall Street Journal_ reported that in March 2018 a high school teacher in Tangshan municipality in Hebei province who already had two children aborted a pregnancy after being threatened with job dismissal and a fine.165 In March 2019, authorities in Yunfu municipality in Guangdong province reportedly dismissed another public school teacher from her job for giving birth to a third child in violation of the two‐​child policy. She had been threatened on 14 separate occasions to terminate her pregnancy or face losing her job.166



“A third baby is not allowed so we are renting a home away from our village. The local government carries out pregnancy examinations every three months. If we weren’t in hiding, they would have forced us to have an abortion,” a Chinese father of three told the BBC in 2016. In response to the question, “If they had come for your wife, to carry out this forced abortion, would it have been possible to resist? Could you have refused?,” he answered: “No we cannot resist. There would be many family planning officers to take us away. They would put us in a van, directly to the family planning office, for the abortion.”167



The BBC investigation showcased an official who said that his district requires women of childbearing age to report for two ultrasounds per year and that if a woman is found to be pregnant “out of quota,” then she “will be advised accordingly.” The same official admitted that he and his colleagues have in the past “kidnapped, drugged and forcibly operated on women.”168



 ** _Minorities Targeted for Coerced Abortion._** Many recent testimonies of forced abortion involve minorities such as ethnic Kazakhs and Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic group. An ethnic Kazakh named Kuliziya Mogudong (sometimes transliterated as Gulzira Mogdin) was forced to have an abortion at five months of pregnancy in February 2018 in Xinjiang. “They ordered me to get an abortion. They said I couldn’t have the babies because I’ve had two others and that a third was not allowed,” she told _NPR_.169 “I told them no, I’m not willing to do it.” Then the authorities threatened to jail her brother unless she complied.170 Mogudong alleged that she was one among “several” ethnic minority women in China who have recently been forced to have abortions under the two‐​child policy.171



Similarly, the ethnically Uyghur Abduqadir family fled China to Turkey in 2017 to avoid a forced abortion.172 Another Uyghur, Kalbinur Tursun, also fled to Turkey to avoid an unwanted abortion in 2016.173 Yet another Uyghur named Gulnaz Uighur said that she fled China after her neighbor died from a botched forced abortion at six months of pregnancy. She alleged that even after the one‐​child policy was softened into the two‐​child policy, “forced abortion was a common thing” in Uyghur communities.174



 **Coerced Sterilization in China Today.** In 2017, the government offered to surgically remove IUDs for couples who qualify to have a second child under the two‐​child policy.175 Roughly 18 million women with IUDs are eligible. After the birth of a second child, the mothers would once again be fitted with modified IUDs that cannot be removed without another major surgical operation.



Surgical removal can be risky, particularly for woman who have had an IUD for a long time—as many of China’s women have. The IUDs often become “embedded in the uterine wall,” according to a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital. “That makes it much more difficult to remove.” Surgical removal may result in bleeding, infection, and injury to the uterus.176



One woman who tried to have her IUD removed, Ai Xiaoming, said that she, like many other Chinese women, had never been advised of potential complications after getting her IUD.177 Her surgery failed, and she had to have a hysterectomy (i.e., removal of the uterus).



Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the practically irremovable IUDs, which act as de facto sterilization. The mass implantation of IUDs equaled “involuntary, forced acts of mutilation,” Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a Weibo post shared nearly 3,000 times.178 That is a lot of shares for a post openly criticizing the government, which tightly monitors Weibo.179



 ** _Minorities Targeted for Coerced Sterilization._** In the Xinjiang region, minorities such as Uyghurs have been subject to strict enforcement of birth limits and mandated sterilization, particularly over the past four years, according to an Associated Press investigation released in June 2020. As Figure 4 shows, sterilization rates in that region have skyrocketed. Those who defy birth limits are often sent to internment camps.180 Members of the minority Uyghur population have also alleged that they are the targets of recent forced sterilization via unwanted drug injections during internment. “We [prisoners] had to stick our arms out through a small opening in the [prison] door” to receive shots, claimed Gulbahar Jalilova, a former Uyghur detainee. “We soon realized that after our injections that we didn’t get our periods anymore” as they had become sterile against their wishes.181 The kind of drug that was used is unknown.



Another former Uyghur detainee, Mehrigul Tursun, told a similar story of having been unknowingly sterilized when she was forcibly administered a cocktail of drugs while imprisoned in 2017.182 After regaining her freedom, she moved to the United States, where a medical examination confirmed that she had been irreversibly sterilized.



Tursunay Ziyawudun, yet another former Uyghur detainee, from Xinjiang, similarly reported that camp authorities regularly “forced [Uyghur women] to take medicine” that stopped their menstrual cycles and “took women to the hospital and operated on them so that they no longer could have children.”183



The coercive policies of India’s past were ultimately punished at the ballot box, with Indira Gandhi experiencing a resounding defeat in the 1977 election partly due to the unpopularity of Sanjay’s population control policies. Yet even in a democracy such as India, where inclusive political institutions offer protection against oppression, problematic policies persist. While coercion is illegal, disincentives firmly remain part of India’s family planning policies. Families are encouraged with a mix of positive and negative incentives to undergo sterilization surgery and have no more than two children.184 And malapportionment of political representation penalizes states with relatively high birth rates.



However, in the past two decades, the Indian government has also boasted that it is the best country in the world for multinational corporations to invest in because it is enjoying a huge demographic dividend (a rise in the proportion of the workforce in the population). The demographic dividend has been credited as a major driver of economic growth in India.185 On the one hand, India’s boasting of its demographic dividend amounts to an implied reversal of its emphasis on small families with no more than two children. On the other hand, that boast has not led to the cancellation of the many rules and incentives that still follow the neo‐​Malthusian line of thought.



Many Indian policymakers still possess a neo‐​Malthusian mindset. In 2018, 125 members of India’s Parliament signed a writ petition urging President Ram Nath Kovind to implement a nationwide two‐​child policy.186 In August 2019, during his Independence Day address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted “the issue of population explosion” and the “consequences of the uncontrolled population growth.”187



The prime minister’s words and the public response to them are revealing. The Indian _Telegraph_ ’s editorial board published a response that questioned the prime minister’s choice of words doubting large families’ patriotism, not least because those words could be interpreted as a dog whistle meant to insult Muslim Indians. Nonetheless, the editorial board agreed that “the burden of population on India’s … resources and environment has been crushing.”188 The piece concluded that what “India needs is a united and robust response to check population growth” that uses less inflammatory language.



The ideas of neo‐​Malthusianism remain prominent in India’s educational system. “We are taught from school onwards that India’s population is a big problem, and we need to control it,” wrote reporter Amit Varma in the _Times of India_ in 2019.189 Supporting his contention, a 2019 survey found that 39 percent of Indians consider “overpopulation” to be among the top three most pressing environmental issues facing their country.190 Varma also decried alleged “immoral coercion still carried out on poor people across the country.”



Likewise, Indian journalist Swaminathan Aiyar has noted that “India remains a country where a great many people, especially in the middle class, are convinced that force is needed to reduce fertility. This is plain wrong and ignores evidence the world over.”191



As an example, a petition filed in 2018 by Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, the Delhi leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (or BJP, one of India’s two major political parties), urged more action on population control and a nationwide two‐​child policy. He claimed that “every year population is increasing but the amount of natural resources to sustain this population are diminishing.”192 That petition joined four similar petitions already in the court system advocating for a nationwide two‐​child policy.



Neo‐​Malthusian thinking is not limited to a particular political party in India but has bipartisan appeal. Jitin Prasada, an influential politician in India’s other major political party, the Indian National Congress, stated in September 2019: “There should be a nationwide discussion on population control. A law should be made in this regard… . From the environment to water, almost every natural resource is under stress.”193



 **Parliamentary Representation.** India apportions political representation in a way that acts as an indirect penalty for large families. In 2001, India extended a freeze on seat allocation between states for the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, until 2026. The freeze was first enacted in 1976, during the Emergency, when India’s 42nd Amendment Act decreed that seat allocation between states for the Lok Sabha would be based on the 1971 census figures until the year 2001. “The rationale was that family planning was a national imperative and states would have little incentive to pursue it if success meant their share of political power would go down,” as their relative populations decreased, according to the _Times of India_.194 The choice to extend the freeze until 2026 was similarly intended to reward states with low birth rates while punishing states with high birth rates and high population growth by lessening their political representation.



Consider Table 2. If political representation were to reflect the changing demographics of India’s states rather than the figures in the 1971 Census, then in 2019 the state of Uttar Pradesh would have had 13 more seats in the Lok Sabha than it did, while the state of Tamil Nadu would have had 10 fewer seats than it did.



Aiyar has pointed out that the seat apportionment freeze has had the effect of unfairly reducing political representation of Indians in the country’s poorest states.195 Birth rates tend to be higher in poor areas because, as Aiyar notes, in communities with high infant mortality rates it can make sense to have many children. (In such circumstances, having many children increases the likelihood of having at least one child who survives to adulthood.)



While reduced political representation is unlikely to incentivize families to have fewer children and is thus an ineffective form of incentivization, diminishing political representation for people in states with high birth rates is nonetheless a form of punishment for large families.



 ** _Family Size Limits._** Roughly half of India’s population lives in states with some form of penalty pressuring families to have no more than two children. Today, 30 percent of Indian women say they want to have more than two children, but India is combating that with various disincentives.196 The U.S. State Department notes:



Policies penalizing families with more than two children … created pressure on women with more than two children to use contraception, including permanent methods such as sterilization, or even termination of subsequent pregnancies. Certain states maintained government reservations for government jobs and subsidies for adults with no more than two children and reduced subsidies and access to health care for those who have more than two.197



A 2018 report from the Human Rights Law Network, a collective of Indian lawyers and activists, identified the seven states that penalize families with more than two children as Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, and Uttarakhand.198



“I was offered a job as a guard at the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly,” recalled Ummed Singh Rathore in a segment published in January 2020, speaking to _France24_ , the French state‐​owned international news television network.199 He continued: “But later the director told me that the offer had been revoked. I asked why.” The hiring director informed him that Rajasthan bans people with more than two children from working for the government. Rathore said: “I have three children, but I didn’t do anything wrong. This law is wrong. Why does the government interfere in our private life?”



 **Family Size Limits and India’s Missing Girls.** While sex‐​selective abortions and female infanticide (the latter of which has become rarer) are illegal in India and have a long history predating population control policies, policies pressuring families to have fewer children contribute to the persistence of those two practices in India, as they have in China. A 2018 study published in _The Lancet_ found that in India there are on average 239,000 annual deaths of girls under the age of five that occur specifically due to gender discrimination and that neglect of female children accounts for half the country’s “missing girls” (or estimated deficit of women given the low proportion of females in the population).200



Laws preventing people with more than two children from serving on _panchayat_ councils harm the sex ratio. ( _Panchayat_ councils are elected local government assemblies.) Economists S. Anukriti from Boston College and Abhishek Chakravarty of the University of Essex looked at seven Indian states—Rajasthan, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra—in which such laws were in effect between 1992 and 2005. Using data from the National Family Health Survey and District‐​Level Household Survey, the researchers found a marked decline in the number of women in the general population reporting third births exactly one year after the new policy was announced. Laws enacted in the late 1990s and 2000s restricting political eligibility to candidates with a maximum of two children severely affected the sex ratio in India, the research found.201



Another study, conducted by scientist Nirmala Buch between 2001 and 2004 and published in 2005, also explored the consequences of policies punishing families with more than two children by disqualifying them from serving on _panchayat_ councils in five states: Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan.202 Buch’s study found that the two‐​child policy in those states resulted in an increase in cases of desertion, neglect, and death of female infants, illegal sex‐​selective abortions of female fetuses, and the giving away of female children for adoption. The study also documented cases of men deserting wives with over‐​quota pregnancies or pressuring wives into having abortions to maintain their _panchayat_ seats.



Some question those findings. Aiyar, for example, notes that barely 1 percent of Indians have ever run for public office. He argues that only marginal effects can flow from laws limiting political participation for people with more than two children.203



Although India has launched campaigns to discourage sex‐​selective abortion and prenatal sex determination has been outlawed since 1994, the law is weakly enforced.204 (Enforcement of laws is generally weak in India.205) A 2007 BBC investigation easily found four doctors in South Delhi willing to conduct sex determination via ultrasound. Many clinics justify flouting the law by maintaining that they are “fending off population growth by helping parents meet government targets.”206 According to the _Times of India_ , despite the illegality of sex‐​selective abortion, a woman undergoing three such abortions, typically coerced by her husband or in‐​laws to ensure a male child, is “very common.”207



State‐​based two‐​child policies have increased sex‐​selective abortions and neglect of female children, contributing to a skewed sex ratio. In Uttarakhand, one of the provinces that penalizes families with more than two children, not a single female child’s birth was registered in an area covering 132 villages over the course of three months in 2019, sparking a criminal investigation into suspected occurrences of illegal sex‐​selective abortions or, less likely, female infanticide.208



Motivated in part by looming intergenerational fiscal concerns as China’s population ages, the government may soon end coercive restrictions on childbearing. China must follow through on its apparent intentions and end its childbearing limits while also refraining from instituting any new coercive population policies. The latter includes resisting the temptation to use coercion to try to _raise_ birth rates with _minimum_ birth quotas. The country should not trade one kind of coercion for another.



 **Ending Childbearing Limits.** There are many hopeful signs that China is moving toward ending its two‐​child limit. In 2019, its birth rate reached a 60‐​year low, lending strength to those in China’s government who argue that the country should not be concerned about overpopulation.209 China’s National People’s Congress makes no mention of coercive family planning policies in the draft of a new Civil Code up for consideration, and an official suggested to attendees at a United Nations conference that China wouldn’t set population limits in the future.210



Several restrictions have already been loosened. For example, many local governments across China have recently ended fines for unwed motherhood. Having her child “would not have been possible a year earlier,” an unmarried new mother named Yue Li, who lives in Guangdong province where fines for single mothers were recently lifted, told _Bloomberg News_ in 2019. “The penalties would have cost tens of thousands of yuan!” she said.211



Yet bureaucratic inertia and local officials’ desire to obtain revenue contribute to the continuation of the two‐​child limit, notes Yi Fuxian, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.212 Even as the national government now worries about _falling_ birth rates, many local governments “hungry for revenue” continue to fine couples for illegal births, reported the Associated Press in February 2019.213 “The low birthrate has everyone on edge, yet the local governments care only about collecting fees,” according to Chinese journalist Jin Wei.214



Eliminating _all_ fines for extra‐​quota births (thus rendering the quotas symbolic) or, preferably, ending the two‐​child limit itself, would be a logical next step in loosening restrictions on childbearing and would take away the monetary incentive for coercive limiting of family sizes.



 **Preventing Future Coercive Population Policies.** Some even fear that as birth rates fall and China faces a shrinking workforce, it may swing to the _opposite_ extreme and implement minimum birth quotas using the same infrastructure that is being used to limit childbearing. China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission, according to 2006 figures, employed about 500,000 people in 82,350 regional offices across the country.215



In March 2018, China merged its National Health and Family Planning Commission into a new agency called the National Health Commission. The removal of “family planning” from the name signaled reorientation toward other health issues related to the aging population and decreased focus on enforcement of childbearing limits.216 Although deprioritized, enforcing childbearing limits is nonetheless a role of the agency and has not yet been eliminated. The agency justifies its resistance to eliminating coercive family planning rules by citing China’s Constitution, which says, “The state promotes family planning so that population growth may fit the plans for economic and social development.”217



Even if the two‐​child policy ends, future policymakers may give in to the temptation of using an expansive family planning bureaucracy to coercively engineer the size of the country’s population (whether to grow or shrink it). To lessen that temptation, China should amend its Constitution to eliminate the reference to regulating population growth and should further downsize the number of civil servants working on population policy within the National Health Commission and decrease the budget for population policy within the commission. Many of those civil servants could be redirected to other projects within the National Health Commission or encouraged to find employment in the private sector.



While a return to the sanctioned forced sterilizations of the Emergency would be politically unfeasible, Indian support for disincentives for large families remains. Neo‐​Malthusian thinking is still widespread, as demonstrated by Prime Minister Modi’s August 2019 remarks about a “population explosion.” However, Modi and his cabinet colleagues have also repeatedly hailed the advantages of India’s demographic dividend. University of Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously said that whatever was true of India, the opposite was also true. This is reflected in the huge variations in different parts of a very diverse country, leading to countless internal contradictions that can make nonsense of many categorical theses.



Neo‐​Malthusian thinking certainly is still embedded in many of the government’s policies. But recent boasting about the demo­graphic dividend reflects a Robinsonian internal contradiction, as the country takes pride in high fertility even as it maintains policies to combat it. Anti‐​Muslim bias is another confounding factor influencing population policy while being distinct from neo‐​Malthusian concerns. Pride in the demographic dividend will hopefully help to erode and end neo‐​Malthusian rhetoric and policies.



 **Population and Revenue‐​Sharing among India’s States.** India’s Finance Commission recommends how taxes that are levied by the central government should be shared between the central government and different states, based on several criteria, including population size. In the 1970s, the wealthier southern states, which had lower birth rates, complained that the population size criterion penalized low‐​fertility states and rewarded the northern states for their perceived failures in population control. Successive Finance Commissions based their revenue‐​sharing formulae on state populations listed in the 1971 census and not the latest available figures to avoid such penalization.



However, the 14th Finance Commission, which was appointed in 2013, eroded the advantage of the low‐​fertility states somewhat. The 15th Finance Commission, which was appointed in 2017, went further and abolished references to the 1971 census altogether. To assuage outraged southern states, the commission also included some benefits for states with lower birth rates. On balance, however, the high‐​fertility northern states gained enormously in revenue. That represented a substantial rollback of the traditional neo‐​Malthusian policy pursued by the Indian government.



Partisan politics also played a role in the government’s decisionmaking. The BJP is popular in the high‐​fertility northern states but has almost no support in some of the southern states. By switching from the 1971 population levels to the 2011 levels, the BJP greatly increased the revenue share of the northern states and reduced the revenue share of southern states.



Neo‐​Malthusian thinking has certainly dominated Indian policy for decades. But the rise of the BJP has introduced new trends. Many BJP stalwarts have called for Hindus to have larger families to stop the Muslim share of the population from rising. In India, Muslims tend to have larger families and so their share of India’s population has risen from 9.8 percent in the 1951 census to 14.2 percent in the 2011 census. Prime Minister Modi has sought to bring attention to this trend. An official slogan to encourage smaller families in India since the 1970s has been “hum do, hamare do,” meaning “we are two and have two children.”218 Noting that some Muslim men have four wives, Modi quipped derisively in a 2002 speech that the equivalent Muslim slogan was “hum paanch, hamare pachees,” meaning “we are five and have 25 children.”219



India needs to build on the momentum of successive finance commissions rolling back neo‐​Malthusian biases in revenue sharing by abandoning neo‐​Malthusian biases in all policy areas, irrespective of partisan interests.



 **Two‐​Child Policy Gaining Momentum.** Assam will become the latest Indian state to disqualify people with more than two children from holding government jobs beginning in January 2021, and several recent proposals calling for a national two‐​child policy present the possibility that the country may move to adopt such a policy nationwide.220 In January 2020, Mohan Bhagwat, the head of a prominent nationalist volunteer organization called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has 5–6 million members including Prime Minister Modi, said that the RSS would shift its focus to promoting a national two‐​child policy.221 As noted, Indian Muslims tend to have more children than Hindus. So, a penalty on large families is a not‐​so‐​subtle attempt by the Hindu nationalist BJP to discriminate against Muslims. Clearly, neo‐​Malthusianism is not the sole motive behind the policy, even when neo‐​Malthusian language is invoked as a justification for the policy.



Consider the constitutional amendment bill introduced February 7, 2020, by Shri Anil Desai, a member of the upper house of India’s Parliament and of a regional political party allied with the BJP. The bill proposes to promote small families with a mix of positive and negative incentives. The bill is justified with neo‐​Malthusian reasoning, claiming that a “population explosion will cause many problems for our future generations.” It goes on to read: “Today, there is … a need to … discourage [couples] from producing more children by withdrawing tax concessions, _imposing heavy taxes and by making other punitive provisions for violations_.”222



A distinct but likeminded proposal is the Population Regulation Bill introduced July 12, 2019, by Shri Rakesh Sinha, a Parliament member who also belongs to the BJP and is an associate professor at the University of Delhi. That bill would grant various benefits to couples who undergo sterilization after two children and enact punitive measures on families with more than two children. That bill is also justified with neo‐​Malthusian reasoning, reading in part: “Given the limited … ecological and economic resources at hand, it has become an urgent need to do objective analysis and intervene to plan the process of demographic change for the coming generation[s] of future India.”223



 **Against the Two‐​Child Policy.** The fears of “population explosion” in India are misplaced. The country’s total fertility rate in 2017 (the most recent year for which there is data) was 2.24 births per woman and falling, so it is on track to soon reach the replacement fertility level of 2.1 births per woman.224 If India follows the pattern seen in other countries as they grow richer, the fertility rate will continue to fall until it is beneath the replacement level. In other words, India is on target to stabilize or decrease its population without any need for punitive measures.



Enacting laws that punish, to varying degrees, large families is not only pointless but may further exacerbate the problems that the government is attempting to combat of illegal sex‐​selective abortion and, less commonly, infanticide. Therefore, recent enthusiasm among some policymakers and activists for the introduction of punitive measures for large families is misplaced. India’s government should avoid enacting a nationwide two‐​child policy, and individual Indian states with two‐​child policies should repeal those policies.



The government should also rethink its rhetoric in light of the recently established advantages of a demographic dividend, notes Aiyar.225 Fertility remains high in states like Uttar Pradesh Bihar and Jharkhand. Until recently, many neo‐​Malthusians criticized those states for allegedly threatening India’s future prosperity, but those states will become important providers of the country’s labor force. Rising living standards have already reduced fertility rates in most Indian states to below replacement level, and many Indians now view the high‐​fertility states as serving an unanticipated national purpose. No disincentives should be implemented to discourage small families, but all disincentives for large families should be lifted.



 **Correcting Malapportionment.** In 2026, instead of again extending the freeze first instituted during the Emergency that has resulted in malapportionment of political representation in the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of Parliament should reflect the country’s changing demographics.



A central tenet of democratic representation is the notion of “one person, one vote.” The freeze violates that tenet by valuing a person’s vote according to the relative fecundity of those residing in the same state, amplifying the voices of those living in low‐​population growth states and devaluing those living in states with high birth rates.



Furthermore, reducing political representation for high birth rate states is an ineffective form of incentivization that is vanishingly unlikely to alter any individual family’s behavior.



Malapportionment of political representation intended to punish states with high birth rates is both undemocratic and pointless and should be corrected.



Every family deserves the right to decide for themselves how many children, if any, they wish to have, free of government meddling. Neo‐​Malthusian concerns, both historically and today, have been used to justify restricting that right, sometimes violently. By punishing those who diverge from an alleged ideal family size determined by technocrats, neo‐​Malthusian policies in China and (to a lesser extent) India both encroach upon personal freedom and contribute to the problems of sex‐​selective abortion and female infanticide, thus skewing the global sex ratio at birth. 



Evidence suggests that population growth can coincide with increasing abundance of natural resources and does not necessarily lead to scarcity and that birth rates are declining dramatically across much of the world without coercion. While the height of neo‐​Malthusianism hopefully lies in the past and China may finally be moving away from heavy‐​handed population control, such ideas may be seeing a resurgence in India and elsewhere. Combating neo‐​Malthusian doctrine remains critical as long as coercive population policies persist anywhere in the world.

184 In 2016, India’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of a 2012 petition alleging that despite their illegality, both coercion and lack of informed consent remain problems in India, stating that many “women [who underwent sterilization] were either not provided any information regarding the nature of the procedure or were outright misled, for example being told by government health workers that it was compulsory to undergo sterilization.” Despite such accounts of illegal coercion, there is no way to ascertain the extent of this violation of Indian law, and the extent may be minor. Unlike with illegal coercion, data are available to quantify the extent of lack of informed consent. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s StatCompiler database, India’s 2015–2016 _National Family and Health Survey_ states that 20.5 percent of sterilized women were not informed that sterilization is permanent, as is required by law, and 57.9 percent of women who were sterilized were not informed about side effects as is legally required. However, this lack of informed consent is a distinct problem from governmentally instituted coercion or disincentives, is not unique to sterilization, and is thus beyond the scope of this paper.

Union of India and Ors._ , W.P.(C) No. 95 of 2012, (Supreme Court of India, September 14, 2016), https://www.escr-net.org/sites/default/files/caselaw/devika_biswas_v_uoi.pdf; and StatCompiler, The DHS Program, U.S. Agency for International Development, accessed August 2019, https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/alSnCW6oOQc5zvKmf6FgFK?domain=statcompiler.com.

In 2008, the Washington legislature passed a law mandating a 50 percent reduction in per capita driving by 2050. California and Oregon laws or regulations have similar but somewhat less draconian targets.   
  
  
The Obama administration wants to mandate that all new cars come equipped with vehicle‐​to‐​infrastructure communications, so the car can send signals to and receive messages from street lights and other infrastructure.   
  
  
Now the California Air Resources Board is considering regulations requiring that all cars monitor their owners’ driving habits, including but not limited to how many miles they drive, how much fuel they use, and how much pollution or greenhouse gases they emit.   
  
  
Put these all together and you have a system in which the government will not only know where your vehicle is at all times, but can turn off your vehicle if it decides you are driving too much or driving in a way that emits too many grams of carbon dioxide or is otherwise offensive to some bureaucratic imperative.   
  
  
I sometimes think privacy advocates are a paranoid bunch, seeing men in black around every corner and surveillance helicopters or drones in the air at all times. On the other hand, if a technology is available–such as the ability to record cell phone calls–the government has proven it will use it.   
  
  
Consider all of the lovable progressives out there who think the government should “punish climate change liars,” meaning people who have differing opinions on scientific issues. It’s not much a stretch to think that, any time they happen to be in power, they will use the available technology to make people stop driving. After all, just how important can that extra trip to the supermarket be compared to the absolute imperative of preventing the seas from rising a quadrillionth of an inch?   
  
  
Of course, the elected officials and bureaucrats who run this system will exempt themselves from the rules. After all, nothing is more important than their work of running the country and making sure people don’t abuse their freedom by engaging in too much mobility.   
  
  
As California writer Steven Greenhut points out, we already have red‐​light cameras, and some “eastern states have suspended drivers from using toll lanes after their transponders showed them to be speeders.” They’re not invading our privacy, the greens will argue, they are just making sure that our actions aren’t harming Mother Earth.   
  
  
Of course, for many it really isn’t about greenhouse gas emissions. Mobility allows (or, as anti‐​auto groups would say, forces) people to living in low‐​density “sprawl” where they can escape taxation by cities eager to subsidize stadiums, convention centers, and light‐​rail lines. All they have to do is ramp down people’s monthly driving rations–something like a cap‐​and‐​trade system that steadily reduces the caps–and suburbanites will eventually find that they have to move back to the cities.   
  
  
No doubt some will argue that even those who drive the most fuel‐​efficient cars should be subject to the same driving limits because suburban homes waste energy too. Or that people will be safer from terrorists if they are all jammed together in cities close to emergency facilities than if they are spread across the countryside. Or that suburbanites are parasites on the cities and should be reassimilated back into the cities’ benign embrace and taxing districts.   
  
  
Whatever the argument, the point is that if the technology is there, the government will use it. If people really want to buy cars that monitor their every move and are capable of communicating those moves to some central infrastructure, they should be allowed to do so. But allowing the government to mandate these things is simply asking to have well‐​meaning, and sometimes not‐​so‐​well‐​meaning, government bureaucrats control how we travel and where we live.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTis the season for global warming alarmists to scour the globe in search summer heat waves – to parade as proof of global warming.
In Central Europe we are currently having a sort of a heat wave with temperatures near 90°F (32°C). The forecast for the weekend calls for higher, perhaps all-time record setting temperatures. This has the heat-chasers here salivating like Pavlov’s dogs.

Source: Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary
But Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary puts the whole global picture into perspective. Satellite data conclusively show that July global temps are running below normal, see chart above or Joe’s video starting at about the 3-minute mark.
Global temperature anomaly is -0.131°C. So where’s the heat? The oceans probably ate it.

Little wonder that Joe later on in his clip says that the warmist side “got taken to the woodshed” by the skeptics in the recent Congressional hearings, which is why such debates and hearings are totally avoided in places like Germany.
Alarmists like to trot out Hurricane Sandy as hard evidence of global climate change. Joe responds with a chart depicting hurricane activity back in the 1950s, a time when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were below 350 ppm:

So what can we conclude? Man-made climate change of the sort peddled by the alarmists is really something for the ignorant and hopelessly clueless to be suckered into believing. There’s lots of educating that still needs to get done out there.

"**England's national lockdown has helped to bring coronavirus ""back under control"" but vigilance is still needed, the health secretary has said.**
Matt Hancock hailed the restrictions a success and said infections in England dropped by about 30% in the last week.
The lockdown ends on Wednesday and will be replaced with tiered restrictions.
Mr Hancock stressed the need for the regional system, saying ""while we can let up a little, we can't afford to let up a lot"".
Speaking at a Downing Street news briefing on Monday, he said people following the lockdown rules meant ""we've reduced pressures on the NHS, we've brought down the number of coronavirus cases, we've got this virus back under control.""
He added: ""The success of our collective efforts means that from Wednesday, everyone in England, even those in tier three, can have some greater freedoms - but we don't have much headroom.""
Mr Hancock pointed to a major study from Imperial College London that has suggested that the number of infections has fallen by a third since the lockdown was introduced a month ago.
However, the health secretary called for vigilance and said the country could not risk Covid cases rising again as we head towards Christmas.
Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, told the same briefing that it was ""crucial"" to have infection rates under control ahead of January, when the NHS is at its busiest.
He said he was ""confident people will act sensible over Christmas"" - when restrictions are to be relaxed for five days - and the country will go into the new year with the number of infections staying down and falling.
Prof Powis also said that the NHS had ""started to turn the corner"" as the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is falling, but said it was ""critical"" that cases remained low.
He said: ""We have the evidence that infection rates are now falling and have been falling during this period of lockdown.
""And we are now just beginning to see that translate through into hospital admissions, which have been falling, and into the overall number of people in hospital which in recent days has started to turn the corner, and is now falling.""
Mr Hancock pointed to the government's newly-published impact assessment in needing the toughened tiered approach in England, following criticism from some Tory MPs.
He said it ""clearly"" demonstrated the move was ""necessary to avoid a much worse outcome"", and called for vigilance.
Asked whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England during a Commons vote on Tuesday are being irresponsible, Mr Hancock said he urged all MPs to vote for the measures.
He said the tiered system was the ""best way to avoid a third lockdown"" and the ""most proportionate way to take the action that we need to keep people safe, and to stop the NHS being overwhelmed"".
Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed his party's MPs would be encouraged to abstain from Tuesday's vote - meaning it is likely to pass, even as Tory backbenchers threaten to rebel.
Sir Keir said he remained ""deeply concerned that Boris Johnson's government has failed to use this latest lockdown to put a credible health and economic plan in place"".
The health secretary repeated the government's earlier pledge to roll out mass community testing in tier three areas, including testing people without symptoms, after the lockdown ends.
Mr Hancock said mass testing had successfully brought down infections in Liverpool \- where 300,000 people were tested for Covid-19 - and would give tier three areas a ""faster way out of the toughest restrictions"".
He appealed to anyone who was offered a test to take one, as ""you might just save a life"".
However, health leaders have warned that mass testing plans in England threaten to be a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine.
Mr Hancock said mass testing and vaccination needed to ""run alongside each other"", which had already been happening in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19.
Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.
This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases - people who do not have symptoms.
It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.
Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.
It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.
Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.
Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.
But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.
These tests were never intended for community use like this.
They may only pick up three quarters of positive cases, dropping to a half if carried out by untrained people.
The government is pushing the boundaries.
That may be understandable in a pandemic, but the effectiveness of this programme is far from certain.
Mass coronavirus testing of students, so they can safely return home for the Christmas break, has already begun at many UK universities.
Mr Hancock urged students to take a test if they are offered one but defended the fact that the scheme is not mandatory.
Meanwhile on Monday, the government recorded another 12,330 daily coronavirus cases and a further 205 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt looks like the article I wrote about Prof. Hans Schellnhuber a couple of days ago helped inspire a new commentary by Dr. Hans Labohm (a former expert IPCC reviewer) that appeared yesterday at the leading De Dagelijkse Standaard blogsite. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber: Het is nog erger dan we dachten.’ (Hans Joachim Schellnhuber: ‘It’s worse than we thought.’)

Labohm also viewed the video of Schellnhuber’s speech at the Stakeholders Conference on the 2015 Agreement, Shaping International Climate Policy Beyond 2020 and felt compelled to comment. Already the sub-title under the large photo of Schellnhuber tells us what to expect. It reads: “Completely detached from reality“.
First Labohm describes the IPCC process as being in a “zombie state” and the Stakeholer Conference as something that is “part of a climate ritual that has dragged on for decades.” and involves a gaggle of people who “earn their living by maintaining the climate hype.” According to Labohm, Schellnhuber’s speech was characterized by “cherry picking”, “spin” and “scare-mongering”. He writes:
So it was again the well-known propaganda tune and everything except science.”
Labohm calls Schellnhuber’s grudgingly made admission that global warming could be delayed yet another ten years as something we always hear from the prophets of doom.
Whenever their predictions don’t come true, they simply push them off into the future. And preferably far enough so that they can’t be called to account.”
Labohm also writes that Schellnhuber misleads the public whenever he claims there is a global consensus among the experts, writing that this is not at all the case “as several prominent warmists have left the sinking ship. That’s not gone unnoticed in a number of international quality media.”
Schellnhuber’s assertion that CO2’s influence on climate is settled science is also illusionary. CO2’s extent on climate change is more hotly disputed than ever. Labohm writes that Prof. Schellnhuber:
…completely ignores the studies that conclude climate sensitivity (the temperature effect of a doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere) is insignificant.”

Labohm points out that Schellnhuber’s explanation for the warming stop (that the heat is being stored in the deeper layers of the oceans) is fraught with unknowns, and only confirms that the IPCC is now finally being forced to admit that natural mechanisms indeed do play a major role and can lead to cooling, and thus can also explain earlier warming periods. It’s back to the drawing board for the modellers – and they’ll have to start over from scratch.
Another example Labohm brings up that shows Professor Schellnhuber is either deceptive, or disconnected from reality, is the Marcott hockey stick. He writes:
In addition, he ignored the fact that, after publication, the author had explicitly and publicly recognized that the data for the 20th century were not robust.”
He also called Schellnhuber’s gloomy scenarios of the future, like 8°C warming, melting ice caps, etc. “Alice in Wonderland”.
Labohm, who is an economist, blasts Schellnhuber’s claim that implementing climate policy to meet the “2°C target” would cost global GDP only one per cent. Labohm points out that the Stern report had reached a similar conclusion, but was later “ripped apart by environmental economists such as Richard Tol“. Labohm writes:
I would be surprised if the refutation of the article/report took more than a few days. The reasoning is simple. There is a strong correlation between power consumption (mainly fossil) and economic growth.”
Little wonder that Germany and Japan have recently announced the construction of new, modern coal plants. Doing anything else would be unaffordable.
At the end of the article, Labohm tells his readers that “the game is over for Schellhuber and Associates”, quoting James Delingpole:
The EU has been the global laboratory testing the green agenda to see how it works. Today’s story means that the guinea pig died; the most important piece of green intervention in world history has become an expensive and embarrassing flop. It’s hard to exaggerate the importance of this for environmentalists everywhere; if the EU can’t make the green agenda work, it’s unlikely that anybody else will give it a try.
========================================
Dr. Hans H.J. Labohm is an independent economist and author specialized in climate issues. He is former dpt. Foreign Policy Planning Advisor at the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, former dpt. Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to the OECD, former Senior Visiting Fellow and Advisor to the Board of the Netherlands Institute of International Relations (Clingendael) and former (critical) expert reviewer of the IPCC.

Call me a cynic, but every time some new environmental or climate change moral panic suddenly grips the legacy media – and especially its wagging-tail, social media – I immediately check to see if there’s either another big environmental-political circus due or a left-wing politician in trouble.



So when the social media Chicken Little screeching about the Amazon supposedly burning to the ground began, with the legacy media rushing to fall into line, it was no surprise to find the following triple-whammy. Not only is the G7 elite excursion week about to begin, but the UN is about to chill the champagne and rev up the private jets for yet another climate gabfest. More tellingly, the whole Amazon kerfuffle was kicked off by failing Frog lefty, Emmanuel Macron.



Well, colour me surprised.



Imagine my shock, too, to find that the whole circus doesn’t even stand up to the scrutiny of a two-minute Google search or even to basic arithmetic. Jo Nova has summarised the basic fact-checking that Twitter hysterics are plainly incapable of. To sum it all in one line: **The whole thing is a political beat-up and the Amazon is experiencing nothing but average dry-season forest fires**.



Global Fire Data shows this year is unequivocally a low fire season in the Amazon. But social media tears and outrage is running at 1000% driven by old photos and fake facts of the Amazon producing “20% of our planet’s oxygen” […] Based on hyperbolic twitter pics French leader Macron is threatening to cancel a foreign trade deal. The hype serves the purpose of attacking the right wing Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro in the lead up to a G7 summit this week.



The photo he used? **It’s a stock photo** from Loren McIntyre, a photographer who died in 2003.



That should have set everyone’s bullshit meters clanging. But if that’s not enough, here are the numbers:



The tally of fire counts here is up to data for August 22, 2019. Emissions are preliminary estimates based on fire counts, but the graph shows just how ordinary, normal and boring 2019 is expected to be when the final numbers are done.



 **Whenever someone starts gibbering about the Amazon, the first thing to keep in mind is just how freaking big the Amazon actually is.** For instance, the once-respectable _National Geographic_ shrieked that more than 7,000 square miles has been “razed”. Well, that **does** sound pretty scary. Except that the Amazon covers more than **two million square** miles. So, the area “razed” amounts to just 0.3%. Suddenly, it’s less scary.



Nonetheless, the legacy media obediently jumped to the crack of the Twitter whip. Yet, even the hacks struggled to beat this non-event up. From the thoroughly alarmist BBC:



“US space agency Nasa, meanwhile, has said that overall fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average compared to the past 15 years.”



Remember when it comes to climate change, NASA are the definitive last word, but when it comes to Amazon fires, they’re just a casual addendum. “No comment”.



Jonathon Watts at _The Guardian_ carefully words the panic. It’s almost as if he is aware of what is going on but not happy to make it too clear.



In fact, the whole ruckus is such obvious bullshit that even **Michael Mann** is calling time-out. Yes: Michael freaking Mann. Mann particularly responded to hysterical claims about “the lungs of the planet” (a claim that was debunked almost as soon as it dribbled from Sting’s smug, overpaid gob, back in the 80s).



The hype is so over the top even Michael Mann is watering it down. This might be the first time Michael Mann is on the same side as skeptics?



Do we need to worry about oxygen?



No. Although some reports have claimed the Amazon produces 20% of the world’s oxygen, it is not clear where this figure originated. The true figure is likely to be no more than 6%, according to climate scientists such as Michael Mann and Jonathan Foley. Even if it were accurate, the crops being planted in the cleared forest areas would also produce oxygen – quite likely at higher levels. So although the burning of the rainforest is worrying for many reasons, there is no need to worry about an oxygen shortage.



When the Hockey Stick guy is calling b.s., you **really** know it’s a complete non-event.

Since the end of geostrategic competition between the U.S. and the (former) U.S.S.R and with the ideological struggle between Democratic Capitalism and Communism over, pundits have been proposing new conceptual frameworks for understanding the evolving global political and economic balance — or imbalance — of power.



Indeed, for close to two decades, scholars have been debating the direction that the “paradigm shift” in international relations would take. What would replace the obsolete bipolar international system and the strategic and ideological forces that had driven it?



From Francis Fukuyama’s _End of History_ assuming a stable unipolar system under which the process of economic globalization and the spread of democratic and liberal values would widen to Samuel Huntington’s _Clash of Civilizations_ forecasting a challenge to American power and values from the Muslim World and other civilizational blocs, and through other complementing and competing Big and small ideas warning of (or hailing) the formation of rival trading blocs, the collapse of the nation‐​state, the New World Order, the Coming Anarchy or the rise of a world government, we have been bombarded with a few useful and a lot of useless foreign‐​policy paradigms.



In a way, these ambitious models were fashioned in response to developments in the real world and seemed to enjoy brief popularity when this or that crisis seemed to be “confirming” one’s favored theory. Hence the fall of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. military victory in the First Gulf War, and China’s entry into the global economy made Fukuyama’s vision kind of trendy. The civil war in the former Yugoslavia and radical Islamic terrorism transformed Huntington into an international celebrity and his “clash” paradigm was all the rage. The post‐​Maastricht Treaty consolidation of the European Union (EU) and the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was supposed to be a sign that regional economic blocs would dominate the international system, while the Zeitgeist of globalism AKA Spirit of Davos seemed to reflect the eroding power of the nation‐​state.



More recently, the growing economic power of China and India coupled with the relative decline in American power have helped popularize the notion of the coming of the “post‐​American‐​American world” while against the backdrop of the heated debate over the so‐​called Ground Zero mosque and the rising electoral power of anti‐​Muslim political parties in Western Europe it looks as though the Clash of Civilization thesis is once again very much “in.” The conventional wisdom is that the brief unipolar American moment is over and that U.S. allies are now hedging their strategic bets as the global environment is taking an elastic multipolar shape.



And so it goes. A new international economic or military crisis gives birth to a new instant paradigm only to be run over by the ensuing events that modify it or even make it obsolete. Recall that it was only a few years ago that the booming energy prices led many observers to conclude that with its huge oil and gas reserves Russia would regain its position as a global superpower and that it would ally with China under the Shanghai Treaty Organization and the BRIC grouping to counter‐​balance American military and economic power. Didn’t happen!



Moreover, while Fukuyama, Huntington and other pundits may have provided us with some valuable insights — capitalism and liberal democracy did emerge as winning economic and political systems in most of the West; culture and religion did become important elements in global politics; regional trading blocs did play an increasing role in global economics; globalization did challenge the power of the nation‐​state; failed states did produce anarchy — they have failed to provide an all‐​encompassing explanations of the way the post‐​Cold War international system was working. In fact, many of these theories pretending to be grand proved to be quite insignificant in the larger scheme of things; not to mention the fact that they were full of intellectual holes. Or to put it in simple terms, reality failed to confirm the theory.



Hence the financial crisis and the growing economic and political discontent in the U.S. and Europe have demonstrated the continuing fragility capitalism and liberal democracy in the West. At the same time, the economic success of Chinese capitalist and non‐​democratic model is posing a long‐​term challenge to the American one. Notwithstanding the 9/11 terrorist acts and the ensuing war against terrorism, the notion that the West and Islam are sliding towards an historic global clash has proved to be nothing more than the figment of imagination — the Crusaders vs. the Caliphate — shared by American neoconservatives, European Islamophobes, and radical Islamists. In the real world, the U.S. is allied with the most important Muslim countries (Turkey; Indonesia: Pakistan; Saudi Arabia) while some of the deep and dangerous political divisions are inside the Muslim world (Sunnis vs. Shiites, for example).



And contrary to earlier grand expectations, the EU seems to be in the process of a slow and painful disintegration, pitting the prosperous German‐​led “North” against the poorer economies of the “South;” NAFTA has proved to provide limited benefits to its members and has not been extended to the rest of the hemisphere; and most of the economic groupings in the Pacific, including the APEC (Asia‐​Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum serve as nothing more than useful talking shops.



If anything, notwithstanding the great hopes invested in such multilateral economic regimes, ranging from the old International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the newer Group of 20 major economies (and the continuing bombastic rhetoric in support of multilateralism), the trend among the large and small economic powers in the aftermath of the economic crisis is to protect their own national economic interests including by embracing protectionist policies. The latest drift towards “currency competition” involving the U.S., China, Brazil and other economies is just the latest example of this economic nationalist trend that included the failure in Copenhagen to achieve global consensus on climate change and the rising opposition in Germany to continue backing the euro as well as the stalemate in the Doha round of global trade liberalization negotiations. The spirit of Doha is no more…



There is no reason to assume the obstacles to global economic integration would disappear anytime soon, especially if the slow economic recovery in the U.S. and the EU would not gain momentum and expose growing economic structural problems and make it clear that it would be impossible for the U.S. and other economies to spend their way towards recovery, forcing them to embrace painful austerity measures. Under these conditions, the economically distressed members of middle class in North America and Europe and other parts of the developed world would be more inclined to vote into power political leaders and movements that favor more trade protectionism and anti‐​immigration policies. Indeed, ultra‐​nationalism and xenophobic backlash against the “Other” — Hispanic and Muslim immigrants or for that matter, the booming Asian exporting economies — could become more popular, especially if the effort to rebalance the global financial system — getting China to save more and the U.S. to spend more — would not gain momentum.



In a way, even under the best‐​case scenario of a speedy economic recovery, the rising tide of nationalism — economic and military — is going to become the default option of the powerful and less powerful nation‐​states worried about growing threats to their security and prosperity. Nationalism has and could prove to be the most effective way for political leaders to win support and legitimacy from their people, a process that could even affect the pacifist nations of Germany and Japan that would drive nations to form partnerships based on interests and not on “civilizational” and other values. This new and messy world would not conform to any of the fashionable and neat paradigms of the last twenty years. But not to worry: An entrepreneurial intellectual would eventually come up with a new theory to explain why all of what is happening in the real world makes a lot of sense, theoretically speaking.

"The use of tools is one example of the growing capacity for analytical thought and invention in apes and early humans. The earliest flint-knapped stone cutting tools date from around 2.6 million years ago. Great apes such as chimpanzees are also known to use tools, from primitive spears to specialised tools used to forage for ants. While tool use is rare in the animal kingdom, it is known among other species. Crows, for example, use sticks to extract snails from shells. And the use of tools has even been documented even in dolphins.  In one population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, members use sponges for foraging. Lacking hands, they pick up and wear the sponges over their rostra (beak), possibly to protect themselves from sharp objects and noxious critters when probing in the sea floor sediment. Previous work has shown that it is mainly daughters that learn the sponging behaviour from their mothers, and that this is passed on through social learning cultural transmission. As among humans and as documented in numerous other animal species, the innovation of sponging is transmitted via social learning mechanisms between individuals, such as daughters closely observing their mothers when they use sponges as tools. The sponging-foraging technique was thought to be part of dolphins’ efforts to find nutritious, bottom-dwelling fish that do not have a swim bladder. As the dolphins’ echolocation sense uses the swim bladder to detect fish, a lack of it makes it hard or impossible for the dolphin to detect them with sonar. But until now there’s not been much evidence to support this idea. Our team made up of scientists from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, Murdoch University and the University of New South Wales in Australia, as well as the Marine Scotland Science labs, used fatty acid signature analysis to identify dietary differences between the dolphins that use sponges and those that do not. The aim was to detect differences in the blubber, where fatty acids from fish prey are deposited. Differences between those that use sponge tools and those that don’t would suggest differences in the long-term diet. We sampled 36 dolphins from two different research sites in Shark Bay, of which 11 were routine tool-users. At each site, we found evidence of a clear dietary difference between the two groups. In fact the differences were pronounced enough to be usually associated with different populations from different areas, or even differing species, rather than those found among individuals sharing the same habitat.  The fatty acid profile found in Shark Bay dolphins that do not use tools is the same, which demonstrates that the tool-using dolphins are able to exploit an ecological niche and the food it offers that would otherwise not be available to them. Cultural transmission, including of tool use, has been identified as the major driver of human evolution. The dolphins’ method for finding new food sources has led to a significant reduction in competition for food – perhaps one of the reasons why it is in Shark Bay that the highest density of dolphins are found."

IPCC now too moderate for professional scaremongers | Herald Sun Andrew Bolt Blog 
What happened to “listen to the science”?
A GLOBAL lobby group has distributed a “spin sheet” encouraging its 300 member organisations to emphasise the link between climate change and extreme weather events, despite uncertainties acknowledged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
An “action pack” distributed by Global Campaign for Climate Action said members “shouldn’t be afraid to make the connection”, despite the sometimes low level of confidence in the official documents of the IPCC. The action pack, which was produced to coincide with the release of the latest full IPCC report into the link between climate change and extreme weather events, rekindled claims that overstating the case damaged the credibility of the science…

The full report … presented a cautious appraisal and said it was unable to answer confidently whether climate was becoming more extreme.
But GCCA told its member organisations to “use the precautionary principle to argue that we must take potential risks seriously even if the science doesn’t offer high confidence”.
“Generally, all weather events are now connected to climate change, because we have altered the fundamental condition of the climate, that is, the background environment that gives rise to all weather,” the action plan said.
GCCA has about 300 members worldwide including Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, Environment America, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Amnesty International and Pew Environment Group.
What’s important to these extremists is not the evidence but the scare.

"Rocky shorelines and weathered saltbox homes dot the landscape of South Thomaston on the coast of Maine. Lobster traps take up frontyard real estate and lobster shacks, still shuttered for the season, are common sightings. Back from a day of scalloping, lobsterman Bob Baines has docked his boat, the FV Thrasher, at the Spruce Head Fishermans Co-op. His sternman, David McLellan, clad in waterproof overalls like Baines, shucks the last few hauls, tossing the meats into a bucket and the shells overboard. It’s the last week of scallop season, but there is a new venture on the horizon. Baines, 64, steers the Thrasher back out toward Hewett Island on Penobscot Bay to check on the underwater kelp farm that he “planted” in December. It’s a willowy structure made up of moorings, buoys and ropes that hovers 7ft underwater and spans 1,000ft wide, like a monster cat’s cradle. The only indicator that there is anything happening below the surface are the buoys that outline a hidden plot, with 13 parallel lines criss-crossing back and forth, each wrapped in a helix of twine impregnated with kelp seed that has grown into translucent brown ribbons. Baines is among the latest of 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming. It’s boom time for lobster in Maine – 2019 was the fourth most profitable year in the history of an industry that accounts for $1bn in state revenue, second only to tourism. But a variety of factors, most of which can be traced to climate change, have left lobstermen more vulnerable than ever. The lobster industry’s unprecedented growth may sound like a good thing, but the cause of it is alarming. According to a 2015 Science magazine study, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world’s oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation efforts implemented over the years, has accounted for the flourishing of the lobster population; lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster fisheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters. “I think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,” says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine’s Island Institute, who works with fishermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. “But the changes that are occurring are undeniable.” Those changes aren’t good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. “The ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,” says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidification, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially benefit marine life in the future. “The Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn’t used to be that way,” says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he’s squinting. “When I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground fish – cod, haddock, hake – that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.” The way Baines says “cod” sounds more like “caught”, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here. While Baines still goes out scalloping and sometimes fishes for halibut, most Maine lobstermen these days rely entirely on lobster to survive. If it’s a bad year for lobster, it’s a very bad year for lobstermen. And, in general, profit margins are lower than they were years ago, due to fuel costs and the rising price of bait and gear, in addition to regulations placed on lobster fishing by the federal government to protect the endangered right whale. Federal restrictions due to the trade war with China and the economic fallout caused by Covid-19 have further devastated their bottom line. If it’s a bad year for lobster, it’s a very bad year for lobstermen Kelp farming is positioned as a form of insurance, offering lobstermen such as Baines some of the financial security off-season fishing once did. He is one of the 24 “partner farmers” working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the first commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines’s daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season – from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster’s summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch. The farmers grow two types of kelp – ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp – which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms’ partner farmers’ lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time. In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines’ kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest – though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. “We were getting ready to harvest,” says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. “There were 18,000 feet of line, 3 ½ to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long – we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.” After last year’s debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven’t crossed, which would rub the kelp right off, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest. “I’m not much of a quitter,” says Hutchins. “When Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.” Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started fishing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20-year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins fished for shrimp during the lobster off-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp fishery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp. “We wanted to fill the void where we had lost shrimping,” says Brewer, who wears a fleece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. “The price of lobster is so volatile anyways,” adds Hutchins. “What we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping. Normally this is the highest price time of year. I got $10.50 to $11 per lb this time last year. And now we’re at $4, $4.50. So it’s nice for me to have something else to fall back on besides lobstering.” Back in South Thomaston, Baines cruises toward his kelp farm, pointing it out on a chart plotter, where it looks like a stick drawing of a rectangle on a digital screen. It appears straightforward enough, but creating a three-dimensional rope structure in the ocean is as challenging as you’d think. “When you’re seeding the farm, you’re working out of a skiff, not out of a big lobster boat,” says Baines. “In a 14ft skiff in choppy waters, you’re bouncing all over the place. When I got home that first day of seeding, I hadn’t been that tired in I don’t know how many years of fishing.” But the effort seems to be paying off. Baines lifts a line out of the water, from where kelp the color of a Budweiser bottle dangles like streamers and offers a sample. The flavor is fresh and vegetal, like underripe peas, and, surprisingly, not salty. No wonder it has gastronomic appeal. Atlantic Sea Farms’ kelp has been championed by the likes of Alice Waters, renowned chef, and made an appearance last March in a salad created by chef David Chang for the fast-casual chain Sweetgreen. At Chaval, a French and Spanish-influenced restaurant in Portland, kelp has found its way into the glass – dried and powdered, in a salted cocktail rim that tasted like the beach – and onto the plate – in an ethereally crisp churro stuffed with lemon cream, where kelp is integrated into the dough and blended into the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top. Despite the multifold promise of kelp, not everyone is on board with seaweed aquaculture. “Kelp farming is so new that for many fishermen, the initial reaction is ‘I don’t want that around here, that’s where I go lobstering’,” says Baines. At a community hearing last year to review the lease for Baine’s kelp farm, other lobstermen complained that the aquaculture lease would somehow hamper their ability to catch lobster, even though kelp farming occurs from winter to the spring, during lobster’s off-season. “It’s not a reasonable argument,” says Baines. “Once they see that my lease didn’t bother anyone or take anything away from them, it will all settle right down.” Meanwhile, Atlantic Sea Farms powers ahead. They have plans to move into a larger facility and there is a waitlist of fishermen who want to farm with them. They want to expand their network of partner farmers, which currently numbers 24. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the waters have become choppy. In late March, Atlantic Sea Farms lost most of their food service clients, which made up about 50% of their accounts. Simultaneously, they saw increased retail and meal kit demand, and a surge in online sales. In the short term, they hope to shift the ratio of their contracts toward retail, with a Wegmans rollout and an expansion into Whole Foods in New England and other regions scheduled for the summer. Bob Baines, Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer, and the rest of the partner farmers received an email in late March from Briana Warner, the chief executive of Atlantic Sea Farms, assuring them that the company is still committed to buying their kelp. “Lobster prices dropped dramatically and we are heading into the lobster season very soon, so this kelp income matters more than before,” says Warner. “It could be a very hard season.” To meet the CDC standards for social distancing, Atlantic Sea Farms will not be bringing in their usual seasonal workers who commute from Massachusetts each day during harvest to process the kelp. Instead, it will be done with a local skeleton crew made up mostly of the company’s management team. “It hurts but we’ll get through it,” says Warner. As for the farmers, they are happy to have work they can rely on. “This is the hardest time of year for commercial fishermen,” says Hutchins of the winter-spring season. “And this year, not knowing what will happen with the lobster market as a whole, it’s nice to know I have something coming in.”"

It is quite depressing to live in a country where there is such hostility towards free speech. A Radio NZ article covering the Free Speech trial in Auckland did not even try to hide its bias.



One of the people involved in the trial who is standing up for free speech was smeared with an incredible litany of adjectives. The bit at the end highlighting the man’s work was disgusting and is as low a blow as it was malicious.



would-be Dunedin Mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer



Of course, there was no string of adjectives for Mayor Phil Goff although there is much to criticise about him. Imagine if he had been described like this…



Current Auckland Mayor, Free speech denier, Karl Marx supporter and terrorist hand holder Phil Goff.



The headline for the thoroughly biased news article started the way it intended to finish with a general stereotype and smear for all the New Zealanders who dared to turn up in large numbers to support the Free Speech Coalition.



 **Free Speech is not controversial.** Wanting to censor free speech is controversial but that is not what the headline meant. 



Straight away the article claims that New Zealand’s “notable right-wing figures” were at the Auckland High Court but it then slyly fails to make clear which of the people it then mentions actually fits that description. Ask yourself if you have ever heard Phil Goff or Jacinda Ardern or even Helen Clark described by the media as left-wing figures recently. The media rarely if ever describe lefties as left-wing but when they use the right-wing description it is meant as a negative slur.



[…] Representing the Free Speech Coalition is the Queen’s Counsel Jack Hodder, who was recently snapped up by the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners to oppose changes to the country’s gun laws.



What a dirty little paragraph that is. It is a clear attempt to try to link one court case to another in the reader’s mind. 



[…] They claim Mayor Phil Goff “ordered or dictated” this decision, for which they say there was no lawful basis.



The council claims the plug was pulled on the event entirely on health and safety grounds, after the strength of opposition to the speakers became apparent.



But Mr Hodder spent much of yesterday looking for holes in this assertion, claiming the decision was made without consulting police and with no credible evidence of a security risk.



This, Mr Hodder said, created a concerning precedent – “the thug’s veto”.



[…] The council’s lawyers steered clear of addressing the controversial views held by Ms Southern and Ms Molyneux,[…]



Of course, they steered clear of them. Phil Goff in his public tweet made it very clear that he wanted them banned because he disagreed with their views but the council now have to clean up his mess (an expensive legal battle) by attempting to make a case that the speakers were banned for a completely different reason.



To the average person on the street Goff’s tweet clearly conveyed the impression that he had banned the two Canadian speakers from an Auckland Council-owned venue.  




Speaking outside of court, Mr Williams told RNZ he […] was only taking this action to overturn what was a dangerous precedent.



“This is somewhat unusual in New Zealand but pretty common around the world – it’s **public-interest litigation,”** he said.



“We’re not seeking money from Auckland Council, **we’re seeking a declaration that what the council did was wrong** so that in the future councils must take into account freedom of association, freedom of speech and freedom of thought before they use health and safety as a trump card to cancel a speaker.”



[…]”The whole point of free speech is protecting speech you don’t agree with,” he said.

For every David Attenborough, Prince Harry or James Shaw there are at least as many man-made climate change sceptics supported by science. But how good is the science?



Sanjeev Sabhlok writing for Climate Change Dispatch says **“Driven by Bad Science, Climate Change Climate Alarm is an Excuse to Ignore Real Problems”.** Sabhlok’s gripe is that the IPCC “fails to emphasize that without using fossil fuels today, our future generations won’t become even half as rich”. He discusses an aspect of bad science that man-made climate change hangs off – dangerous CO2 levels.



“There is overwhelming evidence that today’s CO2 level of 400 ppm is simply too low. Commercial greenhouse farmers insist on 1,500 ppm of CO2 to get the best plant output.  
That makes sense because most of today’s plants evolved over the past 250 million years when average CO2 levels were around 1,200 ppm.



We also know that at 150 ppm of CO2 plants struggle to survive. It seems sensible, therefore, to aim for a minimum level of 1,200 ppm of CO2 in the air. At what level will CO2 start harming us? A simple calculation can answer this. At 21 percent of the atmosphere, oxygen is currently 500 times the concentration of CO2



We also know that millions of Tibetans and Ladakh residents routinely live at 60 percent of this oxygen level. This means there is “space” in the air for up to 200 times more CO2 without reducing oxygen availability.



While submariners routinely operate at 5,000 ppm, they could easily do so also at higher levels if necessary.



  
New Zealand’s goal of being carbon neutral by 2050 rests entirely on computer modelling of atmospheric CO2 levels. But **the 400 ppm CO 2 baseline was determined by computer modelling** which included sampling from overseas sites for which there is debate around site location and wind flow.



So why are we using a likely unnecessary and unrealistic baseline of 400 ppm CO2, and, more importantly, how well do we measure our CO2 levels?



“Last year the NIWA atmosphere-ocean scientist was awarded $11.4 million from MBIE’s prestigious Endeavour Fund to develop CarbonWatchNZ.”



This ambitious programme aims to build **the world’s first complete national-scale picture of a country’s carbon balance based on measurements of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”**



NIWA is telling us our atmospheric CO2 is calculated by estimating fuel emissions and deducting CO2 uptakes through forestry by computer modelling. But now CarbonWatchNZ will measure actual air samples – but don’t get too excited because they will still integrate manipulated data.



“The project involves measuring CO2 and methane (CH4) in the air above New Zealand at a network of sites around the country. 



**By combining these atmospheric measurements with information about winds and air movement over our cities, forests and farmlands,** CarbonWatchNZ will measure the greenhouse gases we are emitting and how much carbon our landscapes absorb. 



When these “top down” atmospheric observations are added to existing estimates from the ground up, New Zealand will be able to build the **world’s first complete picture of a country’s carbon profile**.”



Woop-de-doo! Another model which will apparently be better than the last – not forgetting that they are still estimates. 



We exceeded our baseline level of 400 ppm of CO2 back in 2016, but our data, including baseline, is also reviewed and revised by overseas experts. The Ministry for the Environment reported back in 2016. 



“Every year international expert reviewers examine the inventory and critique the report against internationally agreed guidelines. They then recommend areas for improvement.  
 **To make improvements, it is sometimes necessary to recalculate estimates** of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for some or all years in the time series, not just the latest reporting year.”



  
Little wonder scientists disagree on climate change when the data is overhauled and manipulated before it even gets to Joe Public who can take as gospel what the media says and what is now taught at school. 



So, what did CarbonWatchNZ find in their first year?



“By the end of 2019, New Zealand will have four new atmospheric greenhouse gas measurement stations and two temporary stations measuring gases and isotopes to ‘fingerprint’ the carbon sink on the South Island? Exciting times! #CarbonWatchNZ @niwa_nz @gnsscience @mwlr_nz @waikato”



  
In other words no further estimates just yet. But, on the plus side, NIWA has $11M to play around with.



Oh well, at least we get to choose what we think about the effects of man-made climate change – unlike our farming community who have been hung out to dry by this government.



Policies and decisions to cull livestock numbers are high on Ardern and Green Party agendas. Putting farmers out of business would be a bonus. Unlike the rest of NZ, farmers get no CO2 credits for planting trees on their property.



It’s clear what this government, and the IPCC, are all about – money and power and hanging onto both.

Quote of the Week: 
Moral certainty is always a sign of cultural inferiority. The more uncivilized the man, the surer he is that he knows precisely what is right and what is wrong. All human progress, even in morals, has been the work of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have whooped them up and tried to enforce them. The truly civilized man is always skeptical and tolerant, in this field as in all others. His culture is based on “I am not too sure.”-H.L. Mencken, writer, editor, and critic (1880-1956)

Heartland Conference: The Heartland Institute’s Seventh International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC-7) will take place in Chicago, Illinois from Monday, May 21 to Wednesday, May 23, 2012 at the Hilton Chicago Hotel, 720 South Michigan Avenue. The event will follow the NATO Summit taking place in Chicago on May 19–21. The Theme is Real Science, Real Choices. Open to the public, registration is required. http://climateconference.heartland.org/
******************
The Royal Society: The Royal Society has taken another step from being a scientific society to becoming an advocacy organization. It has published a lengthy study, People and the Planet, which calls for a redistribution of wealth, reduction in consumption by wealthy countries, and population control (by voluntary means). Of course, a key component of the report is controlling carbon-dioxide emissions. According to the press release, this report was in advance of Rio + 20, which is being used to create additional UN bureaucratic control of nations. 
If there is an agreement reached at Rio + 20, western nations will dutifully follow it, but most nations will ignore it. Certainly, the leadership of economically fast-growing Asian nations has demonstrated a lack of enthusiasm for punishing their citizenry by curtailing growth.
An examination of fertility rates reveals that Western Nations plus Japan have far lower birth rates, even below replacement rates, than many other nations, particularly Muslim nations. It is doubtful that the leadership of Muslim nations will embrace the call for population controls.
It appears that the Royal Society desires to become a new Club of Rome, with its “Limits to Growth,” based upon fallacious assumptions and errors in key definitions such as resources. Similar to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Club used the latest computer technology to make dire predictions. Subsequent economic growth falsified the assumptions and exposed the errors. An article in the Telegraph by Tim Worstall, a dealer in the metal scandium, discusses one of the fundamental errors in defining reserves of resources. Reserves are an economic concept, not a physical one.
The theme is familiar, Western democracies must punish themselves for their prosperity and share their wealth with nations controlled by kleptocracies, small groups who enrich themselves at the expense of the citizenry. The UN, of course, will take a cut of the cash flow. There is no objective reason to believe the report is scientific or even sensible. Please see links under “The Royal Society.”
*****************
Supernovas and Life on Earth: Scientists at the National Space Institute, University of Denmark, have hypothesized that high-energy cosmic rays, modulated by the sun, influence cloudiness on earth, which may cause climate change. Increasing cloudiness increases the reflection of visible light from the sun which results in cooling. Conversely, decreasing cloudiness reduces the reflection this solar energy, which results in warming. Even though these effects have been demonstrated by experiments, the hypothesis is not popular among those who declare that carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming / climate change.
One of the main proponents of the hypothesis, Henrik Svensmark has extended the hypothesis to suggest that exploding nearby stars, supernovae, may affect the diversity of life on the planet as measured by marine biodiversity. He proposes the other major contributor is plate tectonics. The relationships he establishes are statistical and, of course, correlation does not prove causation. However, the idea is bold and if fleshed out may prove to be a major contribution to scientific understanding of life on this planet, or it may not.
The paper is lengthy and dense. The accompany press release states:
“In the new work, the diversity of life over the last 500 million years seems remarkably well explained by tectonics affecting the sea-level together with variations in the supernova rate, and virtually nothing else. To obtain this result on the variety of life, or biodiversity, he [Svensmark] followed the changing fortunes of the best-recorded fossils. These are from invertebrate animals in the sea, such as shrimps and octopuses, or the extinct trilobites and ammonites.
They tended to be richest in their variety when continents were drifting apart and sea levels were high and less varied when the land masses gathered 250 million years ago into the supercontinent called Pangaea and the sea-level was lower. But this geophysical effect was not the whole story. When it is removed from the record of biodiversity, what remains corresponds closely to the changing rate of nearby stellar explosions, with the variety of life being greatest when supernovae are plentiful. A likely reason, according to Prof. Svensmark, is that the cold climate associated with high supernova rates brings a greater variety of habitats between polar and equatorial regions, while the associated stresses of life prevent the ecosystems becoming too set in their ways.”
Physicist Roger Cohen comments:
“The key step of the aerosol formation has been verified in lab experiments and in the CERN cloud chamber. http://thegwpf.org/science-news/3699-cern-experiment-confirms-cosmic-rays-influence-climate-change.html.
I think it is rare that we see well presented arguments for a truly new scientific idea. We don’t know at this point whether we are looking at one of those things that changes the way we think about things, or just another idea that didn’t pan out.”

*****************
Sea Ice: A new study states that the western Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass from underneath due to changes in ocean currents. The study also speculates this loss will trigger land glaciers to slide down and melt, causing sea levels to rise. The latter remains to be observed. The study ignores that the sea ice extent in Antarctica is growing, and in some places is thickening as well. http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.anom.south.jpg. [H/t James Rust] As reported in a prior TWTWs, the GRACE satellites show very little loss of ice mass in both polar ice caps. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/nature10847.html. Please see link under “Changing Sea Ice.”
*****************
Acidic Waters: Another alarmist study reports that acidification of ocean waters from increased C02 is resulting in larval oyster failures in hatcheries. The report states: “the scientists found that increased seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, resulting in more corrosive ocean water, inhibited the larval oysters from developing their shells and growing at a pace that would make commercial production cost-effective.”
The abstract of the study states that pH varied between 7.6 and 8.2 – alkaline not acid. The larval oysters did not die, but grew more slowly in mid-stage. The slow growth may have been a result of varying alkalinity of the water rather than the water staying at a particular pH. For example, a sudden lowering of pH can shock an aquarium and reduce growth or even kill animals in it, while a gradual lowering may cause no change whatsoever. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation. Please see links under “Acidic Waters.”
*****************
EPA: The EPA continues to make outrageous statements. It has been brought to light that in testimony to Congress last September, Administrator Lisa Jackson claimed that further controls of soot would be as beneficial to public health as finding a cure for cancer. There is little question that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of soot cause health problems such as in lungs and eyes. However, already soot in the US is tightly controlled. To equate additional benefits of additional controls with finding a cure for cancer is outrageous.
A senior EPA official described his view of enforcement of oil and gas regulations as similar to the practice of Roman soldiers crucifying natives of a village they just occupied. Please see Article # 1, and links under “EPA and other Regulators on the March.”

Number of the Week: Patrick Michaels points out that total annual global emissions of mercury (both natural and human) is estimated to be 7,520 metric tons while total from US power plants that actually lands on US soil is estimated to be 12 metric tons (about 0.16% of total emissions). Human emissions are estimated to be 2,320 tons and natural emissions to be 5,200 tons, more than twice human emissions. US power plants emit about 49 metric tons, of 0.65% of total emissions.
According to the EPA web site its new regulations of mercury and other air toxins will save 4,200 to 11,000 Americans from premature deaths, prevent 4,700 heart attacks and 130,000 asthma attacks. In total this would result in financial benefits of $37 billion to $90 Billion. Permit us to be skeptical. The web site includes soot which, as mentioned above, is already regulated.

“The problem is we don’t know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn’t happened,” Lovelock said. ..“The climate is doing its usual tricks. There’s nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now,” he said.

Thus, while the authors claim that they [the models] are useful for multidecadal water resource planning in the Tampa Bay region, this planning can be directly done with the original real world data. The model downscaling, other than documenting systematic biases, does not provide added information beyond what is already available from observed data and reanalyses without the model.

[SEPP Comment: As compared with the 1981 to 2010 record, below normal activity and below average probability for major hurricanes making landfall. However, if you happen to be where one makes a landfall, it could ruin your day. Please note that last December Klotzbach and Gray announced that even though their models for earlier forecasts hindcast well (performed well with existing data) the models did not forecast well. Thus, they dropped their quantitative December forecasts.]

Review of Recent Scientific Articles by NIPCC
For a full list of articles see www.NIPCCreport.org
Effects of Ocean Acidification on Deep-Sea Corals and Seamount Megabenthos
Reference: Thresher, R.E., Tilbrook, B., Fallon, S., Wilson, N.C. and Adkins, J. 2011. Effects of chronic low carbonate saturation levels on the distribution, growth and skeletal chemistry of deep-sea corals and other seamount megabenthos. Marine Ecology Progress Series 442: 87-99.
http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2012/apr/24apr2012a4.html
Data from a new study clearly suggest, in the words of the researchers, that “a change in carbonate saturation horizons per se as a result of ocean acidification is likely to have only a slight effect on most of the live deep-sea biogenic calcifiers,” which is a most reassuring result.
[SEPP Comment: This research contradicts testimony by Penn State researchers to a Congressional Committee on the subject.]

"Today, cynicism is treated as a rite of passage. At some point, every kid with an interest in politics and social justice is encouraged to temper their passion in favour of a more “pragmatic” outlook on the world. We repeat truisms to each other. Trump will be re-elected. We’re going to hit the two-degree threshold for climate catastrophe. We are going to hell in a handbasket. There is value to this: simply pretending bad things won’t happen is called blind optimism for a reason. More importantly, bad news and the righteous rage it can induce can provide the necessary cataclysm for action. Like so many young people, the publication of the IPCC’s special report moved my friends and me to attend the school strikes for climate last year. But there was a degree of desolation in my feelings on the day. As I snapped a selfie with my friend in Sydney’s Domain last September, a part of me thought that I would at least have a picture of me there, poster in hand, to look back on one day. “See! I was on the right side of history!” I would say to myself as I floated off somewhere west of Sydney after the coast had been submerged by rising seas. Like many of my peers, I don’t expect to have children, as I fear the world might be uninhabitable by the time they grow up. And even if I do, we certainly won’t be going on overseas holidays, with flights either exorbitantly expensive or unfeasible for all manner of emerging reasons. But where might we go in Australia? Another summer from hell has left vast stretches of our beautiful country smouldering and it won’t be the last. Who’s to say I’ll even have a job in the midst of all of this? The nature of work might be vastly different from how we imagine it to be now, and the growing concentration of wealth in the hands of a dwindling few means there might not be much to work for at all. I like the idea of hope, but I haven’t been hopeful myself and was rather cynical of people my age who’ve remained optimistic about their future. Only a fool would actually believe that maybe we would solve the climate crisis, avoid another catastrophic bushfire season or make our society more equitable. Like many of my peers, I don’t expect to have children; the world could be uninhabitable by the time they grew up When Covid-19 hit, I was three weeks into my first semester of my first year at my dream university, studying for the degree I’d worked desperately hard to get into. I was sad when the university shut and we went online, but I also knew that – right then at least – I was one of the lucky ones. The pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods around the world. Australia had fewer than a thousand cases back then but I had already accepted that, yet again, we would be failed by our leaders and that we were destined to become the next Wuhan or Italy. We were all watching the devastating impact of the pandemic unfold as the curve sped towards Australia. As you know, that hasn’t happened. A combination of luck and mostly effective government policies, along with the terrified Australian public mostly abiding by social-distancing and isolation rules, have helped us avoid the worst of this pandemic – so far at least. Our experience is the exception, not the norm: the most prosperous nations on Earth have been ravaged by this virus. And yet, it is clear that my pessimism-fuelled anger was misplaced. Frustration and rage has an important place in the psyche of my generation, and it has driven substantial progress. The global #MeToo movement, the national climate strikes and the decriminalisation of abortion here in New South Wales could not have got off the ground without it. And yet amid this crisis, I’ve come to worry that rage is conflated with cynicism; that in order to protest the system, we have started to somehow believe it has completely failed. It took a pandemic for me to realise how pessimistic I and many of my friends had become. There is much anticipation for previously common joys: the promise of seeing our friends, or going to a gig, or eating out at our favourite restaurant. I think many Gen-Zers now realise the power of the opposing force to rage and cynicism: hope. Many in the media will tell you that the young are the true victims of this crisis: we will inherit a terrible job market, a declining economy, a traumatised health system, and will remember the devastation Covid-19 unleashed on us for the rest of our lives. My parent’s friends delight in thanking me and my generation for taking on paying off the previously unimaginable level of debt. And herein lies the paradox of hope: it is the times when it is the hardest to find that we need it most. Hope cannot make the problems we face go away, nor can it solve them. But it gives us something even more enduring: the motivation to keep going, in spite of it all. And as we begin to look beyond the immediate crisis, hope is the one commodity our generation must harness. I now know, for myself at least, that it won’t be in short supply. • Grace Lagan is a university student in Sydney"
"**A hair salon which repeatedly opened during the current lockdown has been ordered to close by magistrates.**
Sinead Quinn, owner of Quinn Blakey Hairdressing in Oakenshaw, near Bradford, had received fines totalling Â£17,000 for trading during lockdown.
The order to close the salon will last until just after midnight on Wednesday ""to prevent nuisance to members of the public and to safeguard public health"".
Ms Quinn did not appear at the Bradford Magistrates' Court hearing.
The fixed penalty notices were given by Kirklees Council, for opening several times in November.
Hairdressers were required to close from 5 November under national lockdown restrictions, but are allowed to reopen on Wednesday.
More stories from around Yorkshire
The court heard that Ms Quinn had been seen serving customers on six days during the current national lockdown in England, and numerous complaints had been made to the council by members of the public.
Tahir Hanif, representing the council, said Ms Quinn had refused to open the door to engage with enforcement officers.
He said she had mentioned Magna Carta, telling council officers that coronavirus legislation ""does not apply to her and she does not consent to abide by these particular regulations"".
Chairwoman of the bench Rebecca Todd said: ""She is continuing in her behaviour, which is causing distress to the public in an already stressful and disturbing time.""
Under the closure order, anyone entering the premises could be arrested and fined or given a maximum prison sentence of 51 weeks.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:



Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the important subject of capital formation and SEC regulation. I am Richard W. Rahn, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and a syndicated weekly economic columnist. My testimony today reflects my own opinions and views and not necessarily those of any organization with which I have an affiliation. 



Over the last few decades, I have served as head of a graduate school of business, a professor of economics, executive director of the American Council for Capital Formation, Vice President and Chief Economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an economic advisor to political leaders in a number of countries, including the U.S., and as a financial regulator. In addition, I have been an entrepreneur and raised capital for several start‐​up companies, one of which, Sterling Semiconductor, was sold to a publicly‐​held company. 



In my view, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in need of a drastic restructuring and downsizing, because it has done considerable damage to the U.S. economy:



In the meantime, the SEC’s budget has exploded, increasing an extraordinary five‐​fold in the past 15 years, with no objective indication that investors or financial markets are more protected or improved. Countries compete not only in the production of goods and services but also in regulatory efficiency, and by this measure the SEC should receive a failing grade. 



In sum, the SEC has provided _negative_ value added. If the SEC was a private company with this kind of track record, it would have long since gone out of business.



A major problem with the SEC is that it does not do proper cost‐​benefit analysis for both new and existing regulations. Many outside observers, who are familiar with what the SEC calls cost‐​benefit analysis, view it as joke in that it often is not up to professional standards. This is not surprising given the inherent conflict of interest within the SEC. Those who are hired to write regulations know that if they ever say they have written all of the regulations that really need to be written, they will no longer be needed; hence, no job.



The currency among those in government is not so much money as it is power, number of staff, and visibility. Thus, the people at the SEC, from the Chairman on down, have an incentive to grow the agency and get it into new areas – whether needed or not – in order to justify more staff and a bigger budget. There is an entire field in economics, known as “public choice,” which is devoted to the study of the problem of those in government having different goals from those of the citizens they are supposed to be serving. The office responsible for doing cost‐​benefit analysis will not be considered a “team player” if it does approve most new regulations. A conflict of interest exists as long as those doing cost‐​benefit analysis report to those who have an interest in making the agency bigger. A partial solution to this problem is to make the office of the chief economist separate from the existing organization, much like the offices of the various “inspector generals” in government departments. One of the jobs of the office of the chief economist is to say “no,” which requires independence.



In this testimony, I will give examples of the problems caused by inadequate cost‐​benefit analysis. I shall start with a personal example. I was one of the founders of a start‐​up semiconductor company. We grew rapidly, required more capital, and were faced with a choice of selling a major share of the company to a venture capital group, selling the company to a publicly‐​listed company, or doing an IPO. Our preferred solution was an IPO because we viewed that as the best alternative to maximize existing shareholders’ value. However, once we had evaluated the cost of going public – much of it due to excessive SEC regulations – we had to settle for second best, which was a sale to a publicly‐​owned, listed company. This turned out to be an inferior solution that denied our initial investors much of the upside potential that they may have obtained with an IPO. SEC’s overregulation did not protect our initial investors, but cost them dearly. Such overregulation, requiring excessive time by accountants, lawyers, and others, diverts needed capital away from new enterprises which have the most potential to create jobs and increase productivity.



Another example of SEC overreach is in the whole area of “accredited investors.” The concept of the “accredited investor” was originally created as a “safe harbor” for those seeking investments in new or small enterprises, and not as a restriction on other perfectly suitable investors. The SEC took this constructive concept and turned it into a minimum requirement by making the registration process so expensive that small companies have almost no choice but to restrict themselves to only soliciting “accredited investors.” By requiring minimum net worth and income standards for investors in start‐​ups, etc., the SEC now prohibits perfectly suitable potential investors from enjoying the profits of new and small companies. These standards appear to be totally arbitrary and rule out all but a couple of percentage of the entire population. Under the existing SEC definitions of an “accredited investor,” a rock musician or football player with a high income and net worth but no knowledge about investments is “accredited.” On the other hand, a young professor of finance or tax lawyer who has not yet met the income and net worth requirements is not allowed to invest. This policy is “stupid,” destructive, and discriminatory. Wealthy people are allowed to invest in things that can make them much more money, but poorer people (98%+ of the population) are prevented from the same opportunity.



The SEC’s rationale for this destructive, discriminatory policy is to protect the less sophisticated investors from a potential loss. If it is really considered public policy to protect people from decisions causing financial loss, why does not government require everyone who gambles in Las Vegas, Atlantic City or wherever to become an “accredited gambler.” When one studies the mathematics of probability, one learns that even in a fair game (with even odds) eventually it does not matter how much money a player has; he or she will lose it all; this is known as “the gambler’s ruin theorem.” Casino gambling is not a “fair game” in that the house must have its “take.” It even gets worse with the state lotteries, which often give terrible odds (if they are not financial fraud, I don’t know what is). Yet, anyone, no matter how poor or incompetent, is allowed, and often even encouraged by government, to gamble his or her entire net worth and then some. 



Unlike gambling, including state lotteries, we know that most people who invest in the stock market make money over the long run. There are already plenty of statutes on the books to punish misrepresentation and fraud by stock promoters and boiler shop operators; and so the “accredited investor” concept is just not needed, and, in fact, it has now become destructive. It would be interesting to know how many people who were prohibited from investing in start‐​up companies instead gambled away part of the money. In sum, the SEC is engaged in an activity that reduces productive capital formation and denies most people the opportunity to improve their well being, which has the side effect of encouraging people to engage in irrational and destructive gambling. If the SEC had a serious and independent office for doing cost‐​benefit analysis, the existing “accredited investor” nonsense would have been deep‐​sixed many years ago. In a free society, people should be free to spend and invest their money as they see fit, and for the nannies at the SEC to pretend they know better is nothing more than what the great economist and Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek referred to as the “fatal conceit.”



In has long been an article of faith at the SEC that trading on “inside information” is evil and must be stopped at all costs. This has led the SEC to create broader and broader definitions of both what is “inside information” and who is an “insider.” The war on insider trading has much intuitive appeal; but like many things that seem obvious, it just does not stand up under rigorous analysis. The esteemed law and economics scholar Henry Manne wrote a classic book on the subject back in 1966 where he challenged the conventional wisdom on insider trading by observing that the attempts to stop insider trading had adverse effects on price discovery, thus disadvantaging investors who were not insiders. Over the years, more and more law and economics scholars have come to understand that Manne was correct. In recent years, Manne (who is dean emeritus of the George Mason University Law School) has continued to make his case, which is now increasingly obvious, of the almost impossibility of containing information in the age of instant information everywhere. To think that valuable information about relevant matters within a corporation is not going to leak out deliberately or accidently is the ultimate naivety. Here we have the SEC demanding that companies keep secrets from their investors and the outside world until the time when the SEC suddenly declares that now is the moment it can be released. Does this not contradict the self‐​proclaimed goals of openness and transparency?



The U.S. government cannot keep its most sensitive military and diplomatic secrets from leaking out, yet it expects thousand of companies with less sensitive information to keep it from leaking. Company officers and directors can be fined or go to jail for a mere momentary slip of the tongue or lapse in judgment. Yet, how often do we see high‐​level government officials go to jail or pay fines for far more serious breaches? Never!



The SEC continues to try to stretch the definition of an insider, even attempting to go after securities’ analysts whose job it is to ferret out information in order to serve investors. The Supreme Court in the Dirks case made it clear that, in the absence of a fiduciary duty to keep information secret, the law favors a free flow of information to the market. Yet, the SEC continues to ignore the Dirks case in its never‐​ending zeal to restrict free speech and legitimate information flow. The 1st Amendment’s protection of free speech should always trump demands by regulatory bureaucrats for more speech restrictions. This is particularly true since Manne and others have shown that the SEC’s information restrictions actually impede price discovery and hence deny investors the information they need to both protect and benefit themselves.



What is valuable to me as an investor is to know if the officers and directors of a company are buying or selling shares. With modern technology, this could be available to me within a few seconds of an “insider” buying or selling, allowing me to act on this information. Instant information on insider sale or purchases is likely to be much more useful to an investor than some long‐​held, sterilized press release overseen by those at the SEC about what they consider to be a change in the material condition of a firm. When I buy stock, I understand that those within the company are going to have more information than I do and will have an advantage over me – and that is the nature of life. To assume that a regulatory agency can somehow ensure that all investors have all of the relevant information, with the same level of understanding, at the same time is utopian non‐​sense and again evidence of the “fatal conceit.”



Trying to define an “insider” is an almost impossible task. During this past year, there were press stories about how a number of Senators appeared to have consistently made outside returns in their investment portfolios, and the implication was that they had information the rest of us did not have in making their investment decisions. I expect that was both true and not‐​illegal. Members of Congress make decisions all of the time that materially affect companies and, as a result, stock prices. An intention to place a costly regulation or tax on an industry or company, or give an industry or company a subsidy before it is announced to the public provides a perfect selling or buying opportunity for those members of Congress and their staffs in the know. There are many people in Washington who make their livings by trying to ferret out the intentions of the elected representatives. 



As a result, there have been calls to place trading or other restrictions on members of Congress and their staffs. In my view, such restrictions would be largely unenforceable and counterproductive because there are too many ways to get around them; and with human nature being what it is, ways would be found to circumvent any restriction. Members could give a wink and a nod to key campaign contributors about intended actions to benefit or hurt particular companies. As a practical matter, it is not possible to prevent members of Congress, their staffs, their families, and their contributors, etc. from having prior information which will hurt or benefit companies. And having such prior information provides such an incentive to act upon it that some will. This may not necessarily be bad, because, to the extent such actions affect the stock price, non‐​inside investors will then obtain information that may influence their own buy and sell decisions. 



If it is impossible to control what members of Congress will do or say, even though it may have a major impact on companies, why should only employees of companies and their relatives, friends, etc. be subject to insider trading restrictions? To penalize what should be the right of free speech by corporate executives, and not penalizing the similar speech of others in the know which may be even more damaging or beneficial to a corporation is both hypocritical and grossly unfair. There have been all too many cases of rouge prosecutors and regulators – some even from the SEC — making untrue charges (which were later thrown out of court) about companies and their executives that greatly and unfairly damaged investors. Corporate officers are subject to prosecution for making untruthful statements that hurt investors. Perhaps, investors who have suffered losses by untruthful statements or regulatory excesses by SEC personnel should be allowed to recover their losses from these miscreants in the same way that corporate executives are fined. This would encourage SEC personnel to be more responsible. The SEC and too many other agencies have abused the privilege of sovereign for far too long.



The SEC has almost completely ignored the arguments of many law and economics scholars in regard to insider trading. It has ignored the mile wide loop holes in its regulations, as noted above. It has failed to do adequate cost‐​benefit analysis. And it has failed to recognize the hypocrisies and practical unenforceability of its own rules in regard to insider‐​trading. 



Again, public choice theory explains the behavior of the SEC in regard to insider trading regulations. If there are few restrictions, and if these restrictions are clear and enforceable, only a few people will be necessary to enforce them; hence, a smaller agency. Congress is going to have to force the SEC to make these necessary changes because the agency will never make them on its own because it does not think the changes are in its self‐​interest.



I have only touched on a few of the issues where the SEC needs to be radically restructured and downsized. The SEC has strayed far from its core mission, allowing Madoff, Enron, and others to completely elude the agency, while the SEC has chased never‐​ending new missions. The SEC does not need more staff and budget to do its job. The problem is that its staff and budget have grown so large and the agency is so‐​dysfunctional it is no longer doing its core job. The SEC has become a major drag on the economy by increasing uncertainty and risk for businesses, and by saddling businesses with costly and non‐​productive regulations.



The current budget crisis should be used as an opportunity to force the SEC to downsize and restructure. Companies that get into trouble are forced, at times, to lay off many of their staff in order to both survive and prosper. 



Congress should say to the SEC:



“You have failed to do adequate cost‐​benefit analysis so we will no longer give you the funds to enforce regulations that have not or do not pass a rigorous independent cost‐​benefit test. The overregulation has reduced productive capital inflow to the corporate sector, hurting productivity growth and job creation.



You have in effect denied 98%+ of the population the opportunity to participate in new ventures without excessive cost. This has driven needed productive capital out of start‐​up companies. Thus, we will no longer fund the enforcement of the existing “accredited investor” restrictions. Investors will continue to be protected by laws and rules against misrepresentation and fraud.



Your insider‐​trading rules are inconsistent and in many ways destructive, so we will not provide you with the funds necessary to enforce these rules until you develop satisfactory alternatives, which are both economically sound and legally enforceable without trampling on basic Constitutional rights of the citizens.”



Thank you very much.

Religious dialogue is worthwhile endeavor. In particular, Christians and Muslims should engage one another. While miracles are unlikely to result, greater familiarity may reduce unintended misunderstanding and insult.



However, any dialogue must be based on truth. Including the pervasive Islamic persecution of Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities.



Unfortunately, truth apparently is not a concern of the Muslim side of one well‐​publicized engagement process with Catholics. The al‐​Azhar Islamic Research Council, Sunni Islam’s highest seat of learning, held an emergency meeting and decided to suspend its bi‐​annual meetings with the Vatican.



The reason: “repeatedly insulting remarks issued by the Vatican Pope towards Islam and his statement that Muslims are discriminating against others who live with them in the Middle East.” The Cairo‐​based Council also criticized Pope Benedict XVI’s “unjustified claim that Copts are persecuted in Egypt and the Middle East.” Indeed, added the Council, the Pope had “repeatedly addressed Islam negatively.” Sheikh Ahmed el‐​Tayeb, the grand imam of al‐​Azhar University, further denounced the Pope’s “unacceptable interference in Egypt’s affairs.”



Even before the Council acted, the Egyptian government had attacked the Vatican’s “unacceptable interference in its internal affairs” and recalled its ambassador from the Holy See. Ambassador Lamia Aly Mekhemar, who returned to Cairo for “consultation,” explained that “We do not share the views that Christians are persecuted in our part of the world.” Nor, he added, does his government agree that “some governments in the area have not provided protection for the Christians in the Middle East.” Moreover, Arab leaders gathered for an economic summit in Sharm al‐​Sheikh expressed “total rejection” of foreign interference regarding Christian minorities in the Middle East.



The Council, Egyptian government, and other Middle Eastern states are angry because the Pope denounced the murder of Christians in Egypt, Iraq, and Nigeria. He spoke of “the urgent need for the governments of the region” to protect religious minorities and urged Christian communities to maintain a nonviolent response to “a strategy of violence that has Christians as a target.”



Apparently the al‐​Azhar Islamic Research Council believes in inter‐​faith dialogue, but only so long as it does not include the fact that members of one side of that dialogue are busy killing members of the other side. Indeed, pointing to ongoing attacks constitutes “insulting remarks.” Moreover, America’s Arab allies enjoy cashing big checks from Uncle Sam, but are outraged, simply outraged, that the latter has the temerity to mention the lack of religious liberty in those same nations.



Almost makes you wonder whether adherents of the “religion of peace” think it really is the “religion of peace.” Or at least that being the “religion of peace” actually requires believing in, well, “peace.”



The reaction of the Council and Arab governments is extraordinarily revealing because Islamic brutality, both discrimination and violence, against Christians is so pervasive. The Pope spoke out after a bombing in Alexandria outside a Coptic Church on New Year’s Eve which killed 25 people and injured more than 90 others. Christians continue to be killed in Iraq and Nigeria. 



Christian converts risk judicial murder in Afghanistan. Pakistan is threatening to execute a Christian “blasphemer” in Pakistan. Iran recently initiated a campaign against Christians. Even in relatively liberal Muslim states, like Kuwait, where Christians can worship openly, proselytism is forbidden.



Egypt is a particularly apt case since the number of Christians is relatively large, constituting as much as 15 percent of a population of more than 80 million.



Violence is common. In mid‐​November an off‐​duty police officer boarded a train and opened fire, murdering a 71‐​year‐​old Copt and injuring five other Christians. Last November Muslim mobs destroyed a score of homes and shops in Qena Province. Earlier in the year six Copts along with a Muslim guard were killed and another nine Copts wounded in a drive‐​by shooting in the town of Nag Hammadi. Kathryn Cameron Porter of the Council for Human Rights observed afterwards: “Copts in Egypt continuously face ongoing discrimination and outright persecution, either by the Egyptian government or through its tacit approval.”



Although Cairo routinely discriminates against non‐​Muslims, it does not directly engage in what we typically think of as persecution. But it does little to prevent private violence. Unfortunately, the effect is basically the same.



Dina Guirguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy testified last week before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the House Foreign Affairs Committee: “Egypt’s native Christians … are the Middle East’s largest Christian minority but in the past decade have faced an alarming escalation of violence as state protection has dwindled.” Yet when the Copts attempt to protect themselves, as in the city of Giza last November, the police do intervene — against the victims.



Guirguis pointed to one case where a judge and his two sons, who were prosecutors, led a mob in destroying a Greek Orthodox church. “At least half a dozen murders of Christians by Muslims in the last four years were rendered crimes without punishment due to the refusal of the state to follow the requirements of the rule of law in prosecuting felonies,” she added. The complicity of security forces and legal officials in violence as well as discrimination demonstrates to all Egyptians that “sectarian violence is a crime to be committed with impunity,” Guirguis warned.



The government also routinely interferes with Copts simply seeking to live out their faith. The state often refuses to allow construction or repair of churches or other buildings, even those for social functions. Christians have been ordered to take down crosses outside of churches and even charged for private worship without a permit. Moreover, the government has discriminated against Copts when fulfilling its civil role, such as issuing identification cards.



Egypt’s wretched record is well established. In its report last year on international religious freedom, the State Department observed: “Christians and members of the Baha’i faith, which the government does not recognize, face personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship. The government also sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed Muslims such as Shi’a. Ahmadiyas, Quaranists, converts from Islam to Christianity, and members of other religious groups whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.”



For the same reasons the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom placed Egypt on its “watch list.” The Commission pointed to widespread “discrimination, intolerance, and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavored Muslims.” Last year’s Commission report cited “a significant upsurge in violence” against Copts as well as “a growing climate of impunity” for those who commit such crimes.



The group International Christian Concern placed Egypt in this year’s annual “Hall of Shame.” Explained ICC: “While Egypt escaped being included in the Hall of Shame in 2010, escalating atrocities committed against the Arab world’s largest Christian minority forced us to include Egypt in this year’s report.” Indeed, last year, reported ICC, was “one of Egypt’s worse years of persecution in recent memory.”



One can’t help but wonder where Pope Benedict came up with the silly idea that Christians face discrimination and persecution in the Middle East. No wonder the al‐​Azhar Islamic Research Council was upset. Tsk, tsk.



Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi responded to the Council decision: “The pontifical council for inter‐​religious dialogue’s line of openness and desire to dialogue is unchanged.” That’s a truly “Christian” response, but the Vatican obviously should not expect the same in return, at least not from its Islamic counterparts.



There is much to criticize in the policies of Western governments, including of the U.S. But that has nothing to do with an inter‐​faith dialogue. It certainly has nothing to do with how Christians, Jews, Baha’is, and other religious minorities are, or at least should be, treated in majority Muslim nations.



Moreover, until Muslim governments treat all of their people, irrespective of faith, with respect and dignity, they have no credibility to complain about the treatment of Muslims elsewhere. As Jesus explained, we should take the plank out of our own eye before seeking to pull a speck out of someone else’s eye (Matthew 7:3–5). His advice should be widely shared and, more importantly, heeded in Cairo and throughout the Muslim world.

"**Video conferencing company Zoom has said annual sales will be even higher than expected as the pandemic drives demand for its software.**
The California firm said revenue could hit more than $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) - more than twice what it forecast in March.
The prediction comes as Zoom, once a niche tech name, has shot to prominence during the pandemic.
Millions have turned to the app to socialise with family and friends, teach and meet with colleagues.
Zoom founder and chief executive Eric Yuan said the company was converting more and more businesses to paying customers, as they adapt to ""a new world of work from anywhere"".
At the end of October, Zoom had nearly 434,000 business customers that had more than 10 employees - up approximately 485% from the same quarter a year ago.
The surge has lifted revenue and profits and sent the firm's stock soaring.
Zoom said sales in the August-October period hit $777m, up 367% year-on-year. Profits were $198.4m in the quarter, compared to $2.2m in the same period a year earlier.
On Monday, the company revised higher its full-year forecast for a third time, telling investors it expected full-year sales of more than $2.5bn, up from $2.37bn it forecast in August.
That would compare to just $622.7m in the prior financial year.
Despite the gains, shares in the firm fell in after-hours trade, after Zoom said it expected sales between $806m and $811m in the last three months of its financial year, implying a slight slowdown in the firm's blockbuster growth rate.
Investors are eager to see how Zoom will fare as coronavirus concerns fade.
Zoom chief financial officer Kelly Steckelberg said the firm remained ""optimistic on Zoom's outlook"", but cautioned investors to remember that ""the impact and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown"".
""Our higher outlook for FY21 is based on our current perspective of the business environment,"" she said.
She said while many smaller businesses and individual users may leave Zoom as life returns to normal, she expected remote working to remain more common than it was.
""Remote work trends are here to stay,"" she said on a conference call to discuss the firm's results."
"The idea that there is a “land grab” taking place in developing nations began with the publication of a report, Seized!, by the NGO Grain. This rang an alarm bell about large-scale land acquisitions – particularly by a number of Asian countries and Gulf States, which are acquiring millions of hectares of fertile agricultural land, predominantly in Africa. Corporations and states including the US, European nations, and the rising “BRIC” economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China are all involved in this voracious purchasing of land. And despite the huge differences in the countries and localities where the land is purchased, the outcome is surprisingly similar: millions of hectares of farmland, as well as forests and peatlands, have been rapidly converted into huge mono-cropped plantations of soy, oil palm, and other cash crops. This process particularly hits pastoralists, smallholders and vulnerable landless groups. What is striking is that in most cases land grabbing takes place with full support of governments which are happy to swap land for foreign direct investment. As a rule, insufficient consideration is given to the livelihoods, rights and needs of local people. Land sold to investors is often taken away from locals who are not even informed, and are often forcefully removed. To the extent that investments generate benefits such as employment, those from the land are usually bypassed in favour of workers from elsewhere.  The global land grab is a phenomenon against which those whose land is being grabbed seem defenceless. It is an area in which multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank, as well as civil-society organisations and NGOs have become increasingly vocal, and which has attracted greater academic interest. Most early research focused on explaining the land grab narrative in terms of hectares and numbers of people affected, in an effort to uncover global trends and examine case studies. In our research, we have adopted instead an in-depth and comparative approach.  By examining Africa, Latin America and Asia country by country, a number of interesting themes emerge: urban land grabbing in Kenya, Ethiopia’s new agricultural investment policy, genetically modified soy cultivation in Argentina, residential tourism in Costa Rica, water grabbing in Peru and Ecuador, new land conversions in Vietnam, and the Gulf States’ investments in Indonesia and the Philippines. There are differences and similarities, local variations and more general trends. But it is clear that this global land grab really exists, and that it’s impact cannot be expressed in hectares and statistics alone. What is striking is that it has not been merely the demand for food or biofuels that has led to this land rush. In fact, a whole set of earlier policies has paved the way. Large-scale land acquisition started to take place as a number of conditions simultaneously fell into place. Huge tracts of land, under-exploited due to poor agricultural policy or decades of neglect, was made available. Foreign state aid donors emphasised the need to attract foreign investment. Land laws were modernised to make buying, selling and leasing land easier in many countries. And in many cases, institutional weaknesses or outright corruption eased through deals. National governments were supposed to decentralise, stepping back in favour of local governments and opening up to market forces. However, local governments have often not been strong enough to deal with foreign investors, while in other cases they are merely extensions or appointees of the same political elites that run national governments, rather than genuinely representing local interests. The global land grab is not the consequence of ad hoc crises; it is the logical outcome from the policies and political environment laid down before it. So while what is happening today is to a large extent a historical continuation, it is also very different from the events of the past. In countries such as Argentina or Costa Rica, land acquisition and “foreignisation” has taken place for decades, if not centuries. For example, the major US fruit growers’ acquisition of land throughout Central America during the early and mid-20th century. In Kenya, the current land grab echoes its clear precedent under colonisation by the British. Processes are rarely transparent – not in developing countries praised for “good governance”, and not even in cases of Western companies that boast of their “corporate social responsibility”. The global land grab has implications for transnational connections and power relations: it reshapes the geopolitical order, yet is equally a manifestation of a world order that has changed as economic power swings toward China, India, and developing economies. Much attention is paid to improving rules or regulations through land titling programmes, implementing the FAO voluntary guidelines, codes of conduct and other institutional solutions. However, the problem is often not so much regulations as the failure to implement them or a lack of practical control. As we have argued, a framework of accountability for large-scale land acquisitions must not only be limited to private companies, nor to governments or public bodies. To be effective it must be constructed as an integrated system of checks and balances that stretches from international trading regulations through national laws to local enactments, to ensure that all the main players of the game are playing under the same rules.

Are Winters Getting Colder?
 By Ed Caryl
There is much denial disbelief going around about our ever changing world. Are the winters getting colder? Are the summers getting hotter? Are the ice-caps melting? What’s going on?
Fortunately there are systems keeping track. And there are simple ways of plotting the data. One plot, available from Goddard Institute of Space Science (GISS), is a temperature trend plot by month of the year. Here is a plot of temperature trend by month of the year (horizontal) by latitude (vertical) for the last 17 years. 

Figure 1 is a zonal trend plot by month for the period 1995 to the present. Horizontal axis = months of the year Jan – Dec; vertical axis = latitude.
Note that temperatures for latitudes 40 to 60 degrees north are trending colder for most of the winter, from mid-November to mid-February, the coldest period for a month centered on the 1st of February. On the rim of Antarctica, the trending-colder month is June, the Antipodes mid-winter.

So, yes, winters are getting colder. Here is the corresponding map showing precisely where the winters are getting colder.

Figure 2 is a global map of the trends plotted in Figure 1.
Note that nearly all the continental areas in the northern hemisphere where people actually live, with the exception of India, are experiencing colder winters. The chart also shows Europe’s Alps region is getting significantly colder in the winter time, too, just as German meteorologist Dominik Jung found when evaluating data from the Austrian Weather Service, read: Austrian meteorologists stupefied.
I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to look at the cooling pattern in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Note that it looks a lot like the pattern for the southern hemisphere summer. Now ask why the Antarctic sea ice is expanding.
Now for those who get all excited about Arctic warming, I would like to point out the dearth of weather stations in that region, and my previous article about bias in the surface measurements. There are exactly three weather stations used by GISS that are north of 80 degrees. Alert on Ellesmere Island is one of them. It is that light blue rectangle at the top just left of center in Figure 2. It is getting cooler in the winter. One other is a Russian station on Hayes Island in the Franz Josef Archipelago. It is getting cooler in the summer. The third is Nord on northern Greenland. It is getting warmer in all seasons. I believe it has siting issues.
The continents warm and cool faster than the oceans. The continental cooling we are observing will be followed by ocean cooling. It is already happening in the southern ocean in all seasons and in the summer tropics.

Fun fact for a Tuesday: There is no professional standard low enough, none, that _Stuff_ cannot plunge beneath. They are positively subterranean news-disseminators, Media dung-beetles.



Saturday’s offering _“As fires rage in the Amazon, international pressure mounts on Brazil to take action”_ is a perfect exhibit of their mendacious outlook to all things climatey and begs the question; if the world is truly facing imminent climate cataclysm, why do they lie about it and exaggerate so much?



 _Stuff_ , August 24, **2019:**



“The Amazon rainforest is one of the world’s best defenses against climate change and it’s burning at an alarming rate.” 



_Otago Daily Times_ , December 5, **1912:**



“Forest fires destroy thousands of trees every year in Amazonas.” 



Yes; it’s over a century since New Zealanders were informed about the yearly fires in the Amazon. But it’s all ‘new’ and ‘alarming’ to _Stuff._



In an attempt to highlight the gravitas of the fires _Stuff_ reproduces a NASA-supplied satellite image but neglects to include the NASA-supplied caption stating **“fire activity was slightly below average in the Amazon Basin”.** Perhaps the omission was an honest [cough] mistake but; methinks not:



Trained and skilled journalists might have fact-checked the screed, it’s easy enough to do because there’s a lot of publicly available data accessible, available almost instantly, at the click of a button:



But that’s not _Stuff’s_ style. Tis far easier to wallow in a permanent state of ‘alarm’ than to seek the truth, even if the truth means as little as lifting a finger.

Share this...FacebookTwitter Germany’s version of the EPA, the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) unleashed a wave of outrage with the publication of a 123-page pamphlet dubbed: “And indeed it continues to warm – What’s behind the climate science debate” (background here).
The government pamphlet defames and blacklists US and German climate skeptic scientists and journalists.
Among those targeted is Professor Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of the the German skeptic book, Die kalte Sonne. German daily Die Welt here and Die kalte Sonne here publish his open letter. Here it is in English with permission (short version).
=====================================
To the
President of the Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environment Agency)
Herrn Jochen Flasbarth
Postfach 1406
06813 Dessau-Roßlau Germany
Ref.: False portrayal in your pamphlet: “And indeed it continues to warm”
Dear Mr. President,
At a time when 17 climate scientists, who are very close to the IPCC (Otto et.al., Nature Geoscience, 19 May 2013), surprised the public with a startling report showing that the climate sensitivity of CO2 is 50% lower than what had been assumed, thus telling us that all previous prognoses of anthropogenic climate warming are in need of correction, your agency the German Umweltbundesamt (UBA) released a 123-page publication titled “And indeed it continues to warm”. The brochure swears by the IPCC prognoses and it also deals harshly with people who dispute the science surrounding the temperature development we have seen so far this century by using false assertions, omissions and defamation in an intolerable manner. For a federal authority, which belongs to the Federal Ministry of Environment, this is completely unacceptable.
Obstruction of freedom of expression
Before I bring up the major flaws in your pamphlet, I would like to ask: Whatever compelled you to deny journalists their right to free expression and scientists their right to critically scrutinize scientific findings?
As far as I can tell, contrary to what your pamphlet asserts, not a single “climate change skeptic” named in your brochure disputes the warming trend of the earth by greenhouse gases. In the scientific discussion, it is all about attribution, speed, and the extent of climate change, and the necessary measures needed for prevention or adaptation.
Falsified biography
I am personally concerned. In the section “Climate Skeptics in Germany” where you highlight in yellow, brand, and pillory the names of journalists, organizations – and the scientists Vahrenholt and Lüning – the method you use is clear: Critics are portrayed as industry henchmen. Regarding my curriculum vitae, you write that I was the chairman of German Shell and have been the manager of power company RWE since 2001. The latter is false. In 2001 I founded the Repower wind energy corporation, made it to the leader in the sector, and was CEO until 2008. Why did you falsify my biography?  Did it better fit the image of the villain you wanted to create?
In 2008 I was named Managing Director of the renewable energy company RWE Innogy, which I played a part in founding. Year after year it was the largest investor in the business. You also failed to mention that my primary duty at Shell was to develop renewable energies for the company. The construction of the first solar factory in Germany occurred while I was on the Board. You also fail to mention, because it does not fit the picture, that from 1976 to 1981 I was a manager at the UBA itself, the very agency that is now mocking me.
That you did not mention my term as managing director of RWE Innogy and my current function as the Charirman of the Deutschen Wildtier Stiftung (German Wildlife Foundation) also tells us that the pamphlet has one sole aim: to defame a critic.
You did not handle my Die kalte Sonne co-author Dr. Sebastian Lüning any better. As an assistant professor of geology and paleontology, he had been a peer reviewer for geo-scientific journals for years. He had not been working for RWE DEA for quite some time. What is your idea for scientific debate when you presume that we “are not real climate scientists” and thus not able to examine the various climate models in depth?
I would truly like to know which expert scientists wrote this pamphlet, where Stefan Rahmstorf is cited as a source 12 times. Can you exclude before the public that Mr. Rahmstorf or one of his colleagues played a part in preparing this pamphlet? It seems likely, because when one adds up the projects the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research have been commissioned to do by the UBA, we see it comes out to approximately 8 million euros (read here). In addition there are various products that employees of the PIK participated in. Example here.
Whenever one falsifies personal data of this kind, as is the case in your pamphlet, then one has to expect omissions, half-truths and inaccuracies throughout. On this matter I would like to point a few items.
Few scientists deny warming has stopped
On page 8 the pamphlet explains that the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) uses 30 years as the time period for studying climate. Thus from that it is concluded that a series of cool years in a decade doesn’t mean the climate is cooling. This is only the case “when the cooling extends over several decades”. That is false. In climate science it is undisputed that the significance of a warming or non-warming period is measured to be about 17 years (Santer et al., Journal of Geophys. Res. 2011). Up to now it has been 15 years since the temperature has stopped rising, even as enormous amounts of CO2 are emitted year after year. Between 2000 and 2010 about 100 billion tons were emitted, which is one quarter of all emissions since 1750. This has to tell us something. Indeed there has to be a force out there that is counteracting the climate gas CO2 and its warming capability of 1.1°C for each doubling of CO2 concentration. But you refuse to consider that possibility. On page 54 the pamphlet states: “From the temperature development since 1998, some conclude that global warming has stopped since this time. However this is incorrect for the following reasons: […] The Hadcrut dataset in Figure 2 shows a continuing global warming for more than 30 years. That is a long-term warming trend. A long-term stagnation of global warming on the other hand is not detectable.” Yet IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri and James Hansen (formerly at NASA) think differently, and do recognize the missing temperature increase. Only very few scientists refuse to recognize this stop in warming, as Stefan Rahmstorf does. This outlier opinion obviously has been accepted by the UBA.
UBA refuses to acknowledge natural factors
The UBA is obviously unaware of the fact that the warming of the 20th century occurred cyclically. The warming from 1910 to 1940 was followed by a cooling until 1977. Then another similar period of warming occurred from 1977 to 1998. In our book “Die kalte Sonne” and at our blog (here and here) we point out that the oceanic cycles were not taken into account by the climate models and the IPCC reports. When these well-known powerful cycles are taken into account, then the warming due to CO2 from 1977 to 1988 is only 50% of what is claimed.

What is even stranger is that page 110 of your report falsely quotes and distorts the content of our book: “Both authors […] of course make natural causes such as fluctuating solar activity responsible for the global warming of the last years”. Just reading the inside jacket of our book would have sufficed to learn that ocean cycles and the sun have played a much greater role in the history of our climate than what was previously thought. It is widely known by the public that the oceanic decadal oscillations generated a large part of the 1977 – 1998 warming.  This is a duty that would have been a credit to the government UBA according to its founding Act.
UBA bans rolling back CO2 climate sensitivity
Since then there have been numerous scientific findings that confirm this. Not least, this earlier under-estimation of the impacts of oceanic decadal oscillations has resulted in numerous authors revising CO2 climate sensitivity downward in countless peer-reviewed articles, and now claim it is only half as much as what was previously thought. Why is this not mentioned in the UBA pamphlet?
Instead, the German Federal Office of Environment (UBA) pamphlet on page 28 cites a study from the year 2000! (Grieser et al.): “About two thirds of the global warming since this time (mid 20th century) can be traced to man.” The study, commissioned by the UBA, gives an anthropogenic greenhouse signal of 59.9%. However the study then states that the greenhouse signal for European temperatures is hardly significant at only 7.6%. According to the study, an equally high impact is assigned to both climate gas emissions and to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). That result is nowhere to be found in the UBA pamphlet. We suppose that the impact of the NAO having already been emphasized way back in 2000 would only cause confusion! Instead, time and again, only the publication by Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf (Climate Change, C. H. Beck, 2007) gets quoted. On page 40 only greenhouse gases come into question: “The warming since the 1970s cannot be explained by natural causes.” Page 45 states that the models “give a contribution to warming by anthropogenic causes (greenhouse gases and aerosols) of 0.5 °C”. And because warming in the 20th century (p. 50) is 0.6 °C, it means that already 80% of the warming is due to anthropogenic impacts. Yet, the UBA takes it a step further. On page 38 the pamphlet depicts the climate model results of the IPCC 2007 report. Here the impact from natural factors is close to zero (Figure 1), if not even negative, and only the anthropogenic factors cause warming.
This all leads to crucial questions when it comes to sensitivity. It’s beyond doubt that climate gas CO2 contributes to warming. But what is more important is the question: How much? As you know climate sensitivity of CO2 is the warming that results from a doubling of CO2 concentration with respect to the pre-industrial 280 ppm.
Here the UBA –publication cites only Schellnhuber/Rahmstorf (Climate Change, p. 42):  “The assured valid range of climate sensitivity is 2 to 4.5 °C […] Thus one can assume that 3°C is the most probable value.”
Since then, however, numerous scientific findings are showing that the climate sensitivity of CO2 is much lower (see here).
In peer-reviewed journals, the following CO2 climate sensitivities have been published:
Nic Lewis 1.1 to 2.2°C (Journal of Climate 2013 ), Troy Masters 1.5 to 2.9°C (Climate Dynamics 2013 ), Michael Ring 1.5 to 2°C ( Atmospheric and Climate Science 2012 ). Also the results of the Norwegian Research Council have cut the sensitivity of CO2 in half. But for the UBA, this is all not worth mentioning.
In our book “Die Kalte Sonne” we calculated a CO2 climate sensitivity of 1 to 1.5 °C. Yes, we have to deal with an anthropogenic warming that is far below the catastrophic prognoses of the IPCC and its representatives: 2 to 6 °C. The main message of our book: the natural factors give us time to change our energy basis over to a sustainable foundation. And as far as I can tell, our claim is not far off from the latest scientific results.
Nevertheless our scientifically founded point of view is being banned by the UBA.
Mr. President, in view of the mentioned publication by 17 climate scientists, who have reduced the CO2 climate sensitivity by about one half, your environmental agency really needs to put the pamphlet through the shredder.
UBA has ventured out of bounds
The tasks and duties of the UBA are clearly outlined in accordance with the Act establishing the (UBA). Among its tasks is to clear up questions in the public concerning environmental issues and coordinating environmental research of the country, UBA mission statement here.
However with the publication of the recent pamphlet “And indeed the warming continues”, your agency has clearly ventured out of bounds.
I’d like to know how you intend to correct this unprecedented distortion of scientific data.
I believe that the Parliamentarians of the German Bundestag should know what kind of publications federal tax money is being used for.
Therefore I am taking the privilege of sending a copy of the German version of this letter to the Chairman of the Budget Committee and to the Federal Ministry for the Environment.
Yours sincerely,
Fritz Vahrenholt

"Species introduced by humans to areas where they don’t naturally occur are a worldwide problem. These “alien species” can cost a lot of money to deal with, and they’re the number one driver associated with recent extinctions worldwide. The rate at which new populations of alien species are establishing is increasing rapidly, and ideally we’d like to stop the process in its tracks.  But first we need to answer two key questions: firstly, what features of species make them good at becoming alien? For instance why has the Indian myna bird managed to establish itself across the world while its relative the crested myna has not? And, secondly, what is it that makes some locations more susceptible to aliens establishing there? While we have made progress in answering the first question, we haven’t done nearly so well with the second. The reason for this is that the environment is very complicated and so many elements of it might be important for an arriving alien species. For instance the climate at a new location is likely to matter, not just in absolute terms, but in how well it matches what the alien is used to back home. Climatic extremes may be as or more important than averages in this regard.  Which species are already present at the location is also likely to be important. Too many and the alien may get easily outcompeted or eaten, too few might mean there wasn’t enough food in the area. Again, the identity of the alien matters in these regards. Habitat will matter, as will the extent to which humans have modified it. Finally, all of these features of the location vary over space and time, and which species get introduced as aliens also is not random, all of which introduces a range of complications. In collaboration with colleagues in Australia and the US, my research group set out to attempt a rigorous global analysis of why some locations are more susceptible to alien establishment. We first assembled a catalogue of more than 4,000 alien bird introductions, featuring everything from Australian magpies in New Zealand to Southeast Asian zebra doves in Hawaii. We then overlaid it with information on features of the local environment, species traits, and how many individuals got introduced (important because small founding populations can easily fail by accident), and used complex statistical methods to assess the impacts of all these different factors. Our results are now published in Nature. Overall, we found that environmental features were the most important, particularly human impacts on the environment – how many other alien species groups were already present, for example – and how well the new environment matched what the species was used to from its native range.  The matching effect is not surprising – introduce a tropical parrot to the Arctic and it’s probably not going to do very well – but it is reassuring, as it gives us confidence in our analysis. This makes the anthropogenic effects more worrying though, in particular that alien birds are more likely to establish populations in areas that already have more aliens of other sorts. This is consistent with the “invasional meltdown” hypothesis that previous invasions help facilitate future alien arrivals. The meltdown result does not simply reflect general environmental disturbance, as we also found that alien birds are more likely to establish themselves in less disturbed habitats – for example, areas where lots of habitat had been converted to cropland in the run up to the introduction.  Another sort of disturbance that matters is bad weather – a big storm in the period immediately following introduction can cause the alien population to disappear. There was already anecdotal evidence for this – for example, the initial extinction of the alien house crow population from Mauritius following a storm – but our analysis shows that this is a general effect. We did find some evidence that lots of native bird species meant alien birds were less likely to establish themselves, but alien birds do slightly better in areas with at least some similar native species rather than none. This makes sense – for example, an alien bird that eats insects might be expected to do better in areas where native insectivores live, as long as there aren’t too many for the aliens to make a living. Overall, however, the types of native plants and animals had a relatively weak effect on alien bird establishment success. While the environment explained most variation in alien bird establishment overall, we also found large effects of species traits and number of individuals introduced. Founding population size needs to be large enough (more than about 50 birds) to avoid the alien population failing simply by chance (the same reason we worry about very small populations of threatened native species). Assuming there are enough birds, then it helps if they breed fast but don’t die too young. It also helps if they are not too fussy about what they eat or where they live. Taken together, our results show how features of the environment, the species, and the founding population size have all influenced the global history of alien bird establishment. They also suggest reasons to worry. The world is showing signs of a global invasion meltdown, while ever more alien species are being introduced to new locations and getting the chance to test their environmental matches. Increasingly, the future is looking alien."
"It’s been nearly two years since Hurricane Irma devastated the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda. Gusts of 150mph or more damaged or destroyed almost every structure on the island, and its 1,600 residents were evacuated. Around 1,300 people soon returned, but since then, most have lived without routine public services or safe housing, and they face increasing pressure from the government to migrate off the island so it can be redeveloped for mass tourism. Antigua and Barbuda are a twin island state. Barbuda, the smaller and less built up of the two, has until now escaped overdevelopment and has been largely left to its natural state of mangroves and scrub brush. Its residents make a living from sustainable fishing and the export of lobster, along with low-key tourism.  Since emancipation from slavery in 1834, Barbudans have governed their land in common, without private ownership. Residents and their descendants can confirm their claim for parcels of land with the democratically elected, 11-member Barbuda council.  Following Hurricane Irma in 2017, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda – Gaston Browne – has sought to revoke this centuries-old system of communal land rights, stating that freehold tenure will allow Barbudans to secure bank loans to rebuild their houses.  Earlier in 2019, the photographer Tamzin Forster and I travelled to Barbuda to see what this meant in practice. We spoke to many local residents in order to understand how the island is – or isn’t – recovering, and what their visions were for the future of Barbuda.

      'Land grab' on hurricane-hit Barbuda could leave the island almost entirely owned by banks


 “After Irma the Antiguan side of government has been calling us all sorts of names, like inhabitants and squatters. But this is our land and we have lived here all our lives,” said Barbudan resident and resident DJ, Ordrick. Browne’s rhetoric that Barbudans are “squatting” on the land has been met with collective resistance from locals who argue that the Antiguan side of government wants to establish freehold tenure to free up the island for purchase by international interests to establish private resorts for mass tourism, as in Antigua. Locals, including secretary of the island’s council, Paul Nedd, have argued that Barbudans legally own land communally.  The situation in Barbuda has been described as an example of “disaster capitalism”. As Naomi Klein argued in The Shock Doctrine, disaster capitalism describes how wealthy elites exploit crises, such as major natural disasters, to reap profits and deepen inequality, while affected populations are still in shock.  Barbudans are highly suspicious of the Antiguan government’s intentions. As only one out of 17 parliamentary members represent Barbuda, political power is concentrated in Antigua. This adds to the often tense relationship between the two islands since unification in 1981, following independence from the British.  As local resident Byron told us: “I don’t think the government is doing the best for the people. They are doing what is best for Antigua – to profit from our land. They just want a quick fix for development.”  Yet residents have stoically remained on the island despite difficult living conditions and a cripplingly slow disaster recovery process. There is only one bank and one post office on the island, and neither are fully functioning. The bank in Barbuda remains derelict with an ATM that only dispenses EC$100 (US$37) at a time, if it works at all. This prompted 30 Barbudans to travel to Antigua to protest about the time it is taking the Antigua Commercial Bank to return banking services. Visitors cannot access money for tours and accommodation, which is stifling the local economy.  Most Barbudans we spoke to were opposed to mass development for tourism, epitomised by controversial plans – backed by Browne and Hollywood star Robert De Niro – to build a large luxury resort called Paradise Found. George Jeffreys, a 72-year-old who has been living in a tent ever since Irma, said that plans for mass tourism threaten Barbudan culture: “The Antigua side of government is against our lifestyle. We as Barbudans don’t want automatic development – we want control. It has to be developed according to our own population’s needs.” Disasters are often viewed as an opportunity for societies to build back better. However, Barbudans have alternative visions of what better means for the island. “Mass development means you need more employees than the Barbudans on the island, which undermines the whole Barbuda concept of lifestyle,” resident Joycelin told us. “What needs to happen is small, effective hotels. Small effective restaurants and shops that can accommodate our community.” Ida has lived on Barbuda for more than 70 years. “We ain’t against the hotels,” she said, “but we need new industries where people can learn skills instead of us always being the cleaners in the hotels”. Others we spoke to wanted to amend regulations to allow Barbuda’s seaport to directly trade with other islands. Currently, imports and exports must go via Antigua, which means that profits from trade tariffs go directly to Antigua.  Recovery is progressing painfully slowly on Barbuda, and the Antiguan side of government continues to mount pressure for people to leave the island. For now Barbudans are continuing to fiercely defend their system of communal land rights."

 **Introduction**



It is galling to hear administration officials characterize the auto bailouts as “successful.” The word should be off‐​limits when describing this unfortunate chapter in U.S. economic history. At most, bailout proponents and apologists might respectfully argue — and still be wrong, however — that the bailouts were necessary evils undertaken to avert greater calamity.



But calling the bailouts “successful” is to whitewash the diversion of funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program by two administrations for purposes unauthorized by Congress; the looting and redistribution of claims against GM’s and Chrysler’s assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners; the use of questionable tactics to bully stakeholders into accepting terms to facilitate politically desirable outcomes; the unprecedented encroachment by the executive branch into the finest details of the bankruptcy process to orchestrate what bankruptcy law experts describe as “Sham” sales of Old Chrysler to New Chrysler and Old GM to New GM; the costs of denying Ford and the other more deserving automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the United Autoworkers, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against similar market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about the direction of policy under the current administration that pervades the business environment to this very day.



In addition to the above, there is the fact that taxpayers are still short tens of billions of dollars on account of the GM bailout without serious prospects for ever being made whole. Thus, acceptance of the administration’s pronouncement of auto bailout success demands profound gullibility or willful ignorance. Sure, GM has experienced recent profits and Chrysler has repaid much of its debt to the Treasury. But if proper judgment is to be passed, then all of the bailout’s costs and benefits must be considered. Otherwise, calling the bailout a success is like applauding the recovery of a drunken driver after an accident, while ignoring the condition of the family he severely maimed.



This testimony provides a more comprehensive assessment of the costs and lasting implications of the GM bailout than the administration has been willing to undertake publicly.



 **Crisis Mongering**



On November 5, 2008, the Center for Automotive Research, a Detroit‐​based consulting firm, released the results of a study warning that as many as three million jobs were at stake in the automotive sector unless the U.S. government acted with dispatch to ensure the continued operation of all of the Big Three automakers.1 Detroit’s media blitz was underway. It was timed to remind then‐​President‐​Elect Obama, as he contemplated his victory the morning after, of the contribution to his success by certain constituencies now seeking assistance themselves. The CAR report’s projection of three million lost jobs was predicated on the fantastical worst‐​case scenario that if one of the Big Three were to go out of business and liquidate, numerous firms in the auto supply chain would go under as well, bringing down the remaining two Detroit auto producers, then the foreign nameplate U.S. producers and the rest of the parts supply chain. The job loss projections animating the national discussion were based on an assumption of a total loss of all automobile and auto parts production and sales jobs nationwide. Importantly, the report gave no consideration to the more realistic scenario that one or two of the Detroit automakers might seek Chapter 11 protection to reorganize.



The subsequent public relations effort to make the case for federal assistance was pitched in a crisis atmosphere with an air of certainty that the only real alternative to massive federal assistance was liquidation and contagion. The crisis‐​mongering was reminiscent of former‐​Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s insistence six weeks earlier that there was no time for Congress to think, only time for it to act on a financial sector bailout (i.e., TARP), lest the economy face financial ruin.



About the economic situation at that time, incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste … [t]his crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.“2



The mainstream media obliged the script, elevating the automobile industry “crisis” to the top of the news cycle for the next month, and helping to characterize the debate in the simplistic, polarizing dichotomy of “Main Street versus Wall Street.” The notion that some financial institutions took risks, lost big, and were rescued by Washington became the prevailing argument for bailing out the auto companies, and the specific facts about viability and worthiness were all but totally ignored.



But public opinion quickly changed when the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Chrysler laid waste to months of public relations planning and millions of dollars spent trying to cultivate a winning message when they each arrived in Washington, tin cups in hand, aboard their own corporate jets. That fateful episode turned the media against Detroit and reminded Americans — or at least opened their minds to the prospect — that the automakers were in dire straits because of bad decisions made in the past and helped convince many that a shake out, instead of a bailout, was the proper course of action.



A few weeks later, on the same day that the CEOs returned to Washington, attempting to show contrition by making the trip from Detroit in their companies’ most eco‐​friendly cars, a new automobile assembly plant opened for business in Greensburg, Indiana. Although the hearing on Capitol Hill received far more media coverage, the unveiling of Honda’s newest facility in the American heartland spoke volumes about the true state of the U.S. car industry — and provided another example of why the bailout was misguided. The U.S. auto industry was not at risk. Two companies were suffering the consequences of years of incompetence and inefficiency exacerbated by persistent overcapacity and a deep recession. Normal bankruptcies for the two automakers were viable options, but certain stakeholders didn’t like their prospects under those circumstances.



Today, when President Obama contends that his administration saved the auto industry, he evokes memories of those CAR projections of 2–3 million job losses in the absence of government intervention. Without those inflated figures concocted during a time of “crisis,” the 225,000 jobs lost in the auto sector since November 2008 seem quite mild — even worthy of praise.3



 **That Which is Seen**



While bailout enthusiasts hail GM’s first‐​quarter earnings as proof that the administration saved the auto industry, President Obama should know better than to gloat. No such feat was accomplished and the imperative of extricating the government from GM’s operations has yet to be achieved.



With profits of $3.2 billion, the first quarter of 2011 was GM’s best performance in ten years and its fifth‐​consecutive profitable quarter. That’s good for GM, and predictably those earnings have been hailed by some as a validation of government intervention. _The Washington Post_ ’s E.J. Dionne asserted: “Far too little attention has been paid to the success of the government’s rescue of the Detroit‐​based auto companies, and almost no attention has been paid to how completely and utterly wrong opponents of the bailout were when they insisted it was doomed to failure.”



Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm tweeted: “To all of you in the strangle‐​government crowd, who said the bailout would never work — I’m just sayin.”



Dionne and Granholm have created a straw man, contending that bailout critics thought that the government couldn’t resuscitate GM. But the most thoughtful criticism of the bailout was not predicated on the notion that GM couldn’t be saved by the government marshaling the vast resources at its disposal. That opposition was borne of concern that that the government would do just that, and in the process impose many more costs and inflict greater damage. And that’s what it did.



But Dionne and Granholm, like others before them, stand slack‐​jawed, in awe, ready and willing to buy the Brooklyn Bridge, donning blinders and viewing just a narrow sliver of the world, oblivious to the fact that related events have been transpiring in the other 359 degrees that surround him. They are the perfect Bastiat foils, incapable of discerning the costs that are not immediately apparent.4



But only the most gullible observers would accept GM’s profits as an appropriate measure of the wisdom of the auto bailout. Those profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed over $50 billion to the task of rescuing a single company. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten, and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a cyclical U.S. recovery and structural global expansion in auto demand — only the most incompetent operation could fail to make big profits. To that point, it’s worth noting that more than half of GM’s reported profit — $1.8 billion of $3.2 billion — is attributable to the one‐​time sales of shares in Ally Financial and Delphi, which says nothing about whether GM can make and sell automobiles profitably going forward.



In the process of “rescuing” GM, the government opened a Pandora’s Box. Any legitimate verdict on the efficacy of the intervention must account for the costs of mitigating the problems that escaped the box.



 **That Which is Not Seen**



 _Spoils of Competition Denied — Market Process Short‐​Circuited_



The intervention on GM’s behalf denied the spoils of competition — the market share, sales revenues, profits, and productive assets — to Ford, Honda, Hyundai, and all of the other automakers that made better products, made better operational decisions, were more efficient, or were more responsive to consumer demands than GM, thereby short‐​circuiting a feedback loop that is essential to the healthy functioning of competitive market economies.



Corporate bailouts are clearly unfair to taxpayers, but they are also unfair to the successful firms in the industry, who are implicitly taxed and burdened when their competition is subsidized. In a properly functioning market economy, the better firms — the ones that are more innovative, more efficient, and more popular among consumers — gain market share or increase profits, while the lesser firms contract. This process ensures that limited resources are used most productively.



It has been suggested that I view GM’s fate as a matter of national indifference. That’s correct, because I have not made the mistake of conflating GM’s condition with that of the U.S. auto industry. Whether or not there are so‐​called “national interests” in ensuring the existence of a healthy domestic auto industry (and I’m not convinced there are), health comes through an evolutionary process in which the companies that have made the right decisions survive and grow, and those that have made bad decisions contract and sometimes even disappear.



It is not only fair, but efficient and wise that the market rewards companies that make better products at better prices with higher profits and larger market shares, while the companies that make undesirable products at high cost lose profits and market share.



There is still enormous overcapacity in the U.S. auto industry, reconciliation of which the bailout of GM (and Chrsyler) has deferred at great cost to the other firms and their workers.



 _Weakening of the Rule of Law_



Although legislation to provide funding for an auto bailout passed in the House of Representatives in December 2008, the bill did not garner enough support in the Senate, where it died. Prospects for any form of taxpayer bailout seemed remote and the proper course of action for GM and Chrysler, reorganization under Chapter 11, appeared imminent. An interventionist bullet, seemingly, had been dodged.



But then, just days after then‐​Secretary Paulson claimed to have no authority to use TARP funds to support the auto companies, President Bush announced that he would authorize bridge loans from the TARP of $17.4 billion to GM and Chrysler. That opened the door to further mischief and, ultimately, another $60 billion was diverted from TARP by the Obama administration for unauthorized purposes related to the auto bailout.



Likewise, the Obama administration treated the GM (and Chrysler) bankruptcy as a Section 363 sale, which are known among bankruptcy lawyers as “Sham” sales. These 363 sales are intended to sell assets out of bankruptcy from one company to another, but are not intended as vehicles to facilitate entire corporate restructurings. In a reorganization process, all creditors are given the right to vote on the proposed plan, as well as the opportunity to offer competing reorganization plans. A 363 asset sale has no such requirements, and is being used increasingly by companies seeking to avert paying legitimate claims to creditors.



That the U.S. executive branch would pretend that the restructuring of GM was nothing more than an asset sale and deny creditors the right to vote or to offer competing bids wreaks of crony capitalism.



Though it is a difficult cost to quantify, executive branch overreach — to put it mildly — is a threat to the U.S. system of checks and balances and an affront to the rule of law.



 _Executive Encroachment into Bankruptcy Process_



General Motors was a perfectly viable company that could have been restructured through normal bankruptcy proceedings. The big question was whether GM could have received financing to operate during bankrupt, given the problems in credit markets in 2008 and 2009. Instead of commandeering the bankruptcy process as a condition of providing debtor in possession financing, the Obama administration could have provided the funds and allowed an apolitical, independent bankruptcy process to take place. But the administration’s rationale for a hand‐​on approach was that it wanted to ensure that taxpayers weren’t just throwing good money after bad, chasing empty promises made by executives with credibility problems. Yet, even with the administration’s plans for GM’s post‐​bankruptcy ownership thrust upon the company without allowance for consideration of competing plans, taxpayers will lose between $10–20 billion (without considering the $12 to $14 billion costs of the unorthodox tax breaks granted GM by the administration).



The administration’s willingness to insulate important political allies, like the UAW, from the consequences of their decisions, to shift possession of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners, and to deny “deficiency” claims to creditors who were short‐​changed, will make it more difficult for companies in politically important industries to borrow from private sources when they are in trouble, thereby increasing their reliance on the government purse.



The government’s willingness to intervene in the auto market under false pretenses to pick winners and losers is a significant cause of the regime uncertainty that has pervaded the U.S. economy, deterred business investment and job creation, and slowed the economic recovery ever since.



 **Outstanding Financial Costs**



As Washington has been embroiled in a discussion about national finances that features figures in the trillions of dollars, one might be tempted to marginalize as paltry the sum still owed taxpayers from the GM bailout. That figure is estimated to be about $27 billion, which accounts for the $50 billion outlay minus approximately $23 billion raised at GM’s IPO last November. But that is a very conservative figure considering that it excludes: $12-$14 billion in unorthodox tax breaks granted to GM in bankruptucy; $17 billion in funds committed from the TARP to GM’s former financial arm GMAC (which was supported to facilitate GM sales); GM’s portion of the $25 billion Energy Department slush fund to underwrite research and development in green auto technology; and the $7,500 tax credit granted for every new purchase of a Chevy Volt. There may be other subsidies, as well.



With respect to GM, taxpayers are on the line for much more than is commonly discussed.



The administration wants to put maximum distance between the episode of GM’s nationalization and the 2012 campaign season, which is nearly upon us. In that regard, the administration would like to sell the Treasury’s remaining 500 million shares as soon as possible. But the administration would also like to “make the taxpayers whole.” The problem for the president on that score is that the stock price — even with all of the happy news about the auto industry turnaround — isn’t cooperating. As of this morning, GM stock is hovering just under $30 per share. If all of the 500 million remaining publicly‐​owned shares could be sold at that price, the Treasury would net $15 billion. Add that to the $23 billion raised from the initial public offering last November, and the “direct” public loss on GM is about $12 billion — calculated as a $50 billion outlay minus a $38 billion return. (And not considering all of the extra costs identified above.)



To net $50 billion, those 500 million public shares must be sold at an average price of just over $53 — a virtual impossibility anytime soon. Why? The most significant factor suppressing the stock value is the market’s knowledge that the largest single holder of GM stock wants to unload about 500 million shares in the short term. That fact will continue to trump any positive news about GM and its profit potential, not that such news should be expected.



Projections about gasoline prices vary, but as long as prices at the pump remain in the $4 range, GM is going to suffer. Among major automakers, GM is most exposed to the downside of high gasoline prices. Despite all of the subsidies and all of the hoopla over the Chevy Volt (only 1,700 units have been sold through April 2011) and the Chevy Cruse (now subject to a steering column recall that won’t help repair negative quality perceptions), GM does not have much of a competitive presence in the small car market. Though GM held the largest overall U.S. market share in 2010, it had the smallest share (8.4%) of the small car market, which is where the demand will be if high gas prices persist. GM will certainly have to do better in that segment once the federally mandated average fleet fuel efficiency standard rises to 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016.



Reaping what it sowed, the administration finds itself in an unenviable position. It can entirely divest of GM in the short term at what would likely be a $10-to-$20 billion taxpayer loss (the stock price will drop if 500 million shares are put up for sale in short period) and face the ire of an increasingly cost‐ and budget‐​conscious electorate. Or the administration can hold onto the stock, hoping against hope that GM experiences economic fortunes good enough to more than compensate for the stock price‐​suppressing effect of the market’s knowledge of an imminent massive sales, while contending with accusations of market meddling and industrial policy.



The longer the administration retains shares in GM, it will be tempted to meddle to achieve politically desirable results.



 **Redefining Success**



Or, the administration can do what it is going to do: first, lower expectations that the taxpayer will ever recover $50 billion. Here’s a recent statement by Tim Geithner: “We’re going to lose money in the auto industry … We didn’t do these things to maximize return. We did them to save jobs. The biggest impact of these programs was in the millions of jobs saved.” That’s a safe counterfactual, since it can never be tested or proved. (There are 225,000 fewer jobs in the auto industry as of April 2011 than there were in November 2008, when the bailout process began.)



Second, the administration will argue that the Obama administration is only on the hook for $40 billion (the first $10 billion having coming from Bush). In a post‐​IPO, November 2010 statement revealing of a man less concerned with nation’s finances than his own political prospects, President Obama asserted: “American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than _my administration_ invested in GM, and that’s a good thing.” (My emphasis).



 **Lasting Implications**



The lasting implications of the bailout will depend on whether or not Americans ultimately accept the narrative that the bailout was a success. If it is considered a success, the threshold for interventions will have been lowered and Americans will have the opportunity to judge similar bailouts in the future. If it is considered a failure — as it should be — the lasting implications will be less destructive because the threshold that tempts interventionists will be higher. On that score, contrary to what the administration would have the public believe, gauging the “success” of the GM bailout requires consideration of more than just the ratio of finances recouped over financial outlays.



There are numerous other costs that don’t factor into that equation.



If the bailout is considered a success, some of the likely lasting implications will include the following:



 **Conclusion**



The objection to the auto bailout was not that the federal government wouldn’t be able to marshal adequate resources to help GM. The most serious concerns were about the consequences of that intervention — the undermining of the rule of law, the property confiscations, the politically driven decisions and the distortion of market signals.



Any verdict on the auto bailouts must take into account, among other things, the illegal diversion of TARP funds, the forced transfer of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners and their union; the higher‐​risk premiums consequently built into U.S. corporate debt; the costs of denying Ford and the other more worthy automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the autoworkers’ union, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about policy that pervades the business environment to this day.



GM’s recent profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed more than $50 billion to the task of rescuing those companies and the United Auto Workers. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a recovery in U.S. auto demand — only the most incompetent operations could fail to make profits.



But taxpayers are still short at least $10 billion to $20 billion (depending on the price that the government’s 500 million shares of GM will fetch), and there is still significant overcapacity in the auto industry.



The administration should divest as soon as possible, without regard to the stock price. Keeping the government’s tentacles around a large firm in an important industry will keep the door open wider to industrial policy and will deter market‐​driven decision‐​making throughout the industry, possibly keeping the brakes on the recovery. Yes, there will be a significant loss to taxpayers. But the right lesson to learn from this chapter in history is that government interventions carry real economic costs — only some of which are readily measurable.

This illustration from a recent article in Science magazine shows that CO2 is plant food.  It is based on both empirical data and model results (not “data”).  I know that looking at empirical data might seem like a novel idea to some people, but for some perverse reason, I find it more compelling.

On the right: Empirical Data. Growth of 21-day-old rice and S. viridis seedlings at different ambient CO2 concentrations ranging from 30 to 800 parts per million. NOTE: The very last set of pots on the extreme right is out of sequence. They are for 390 ppm, while the next to last pots are for 800 ppm.
On the left, Modeled Data:

Modeled changes in CO2 assimilation rate in response to changes in leaf intercellular CO2 partial pressure for C3 and C4 photosynthesis and for a hypothetical C4 rice. Curves 1, 2, and 4 have Rubisco levels typically found in a C4 leaf (10 μmol m−2 catalytic Rubisco sites). Curve 3 shows a typical response for C3 leaves with three times the Rubisco level of C4 leaves. Curve 1 shows the response of a C4 leaf with C4 Rubisco kinetic properties. Curve 2 models how a C4 leaf with C3 Rubisco kinetic properties would respond (a hypothetical C4 rice with C3 Rubisco kinetics). The comparison of these two curves shows the increase in CO2 assimilation rate achieved with C4 compared with C3 Rubisco kinetic properties within a functional C4 mechanism. Arrows to curves 1 and 3 show intercellular CO2 partial pressures typical at current ambient CO2 partial pressures for C4 and C3 photosynthesis. To generate the curves, model equations were taken from (11) and comparative Rubisco kinetic constants from (12). (B) [Reference numbers per source.]
Source: Susanne von Caemmerer, W. Paul Quick, and Robert T. Furbank (2012). The Development of C4 Rice: Current Progress and Future Challenges. Science 336 (6089): 1671-1672.
Finally, note that the top photograph on the right is for rice.  According to Wikipedia, not always a reliable source, but in this case probably trustworthy:
[Rice] is the most important staple food for a large part of the world’s human population, especially in Asia and the West Indies. It is the grain with the second-highest worldwide production, after maize (corn), according to data for 2010.
Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by the human species.
In other words, not only is CO2 plant food, CO2 makes human food.  Guess some folks skipped that biology class.

Matt Drudge has been riveting eyeballs by highlighting a London Telegraph piece calling the “fiddling” of raw temperature histories “the biggest science scandal ever.” The fact of the matter is some of the adjustments that have been tacked onto some temperature records are pretty alarming—but what do they really mean?   
  
One of the more egregious ones has been the adjustment of the long-running record from Central Park (NYC). Basically it’s been flat for over a hundred years but the National Climatic Data Center, which generates its own global temperature history, has stuck a warming trend of several degrees in it during the last quarter-century, simply because it doesn’t agree with some other stations (which also don’t happen to be in the stable urban core of Manhattan).   
  
Internationally, Cato Scholar Ross McKitrick and yours truly documented a propensity for many African and South American stations to report warming that really isn’t happening. Some of those records, notably in Paraguay and central South America, have been massively altered.   
  
At any rate, Chris Booker, author of the _Telegraph_ article, isn’t the first person to be alarmed at what has been done to some of the temperature records. Others, such as Richard Muller, from UC-Berkeley, along with Steven Mosher, were so concerned that they literally re-invented the surface temperature history from scratch. In doing so, both of them found the “adjustments” really don’t make all that much difference when compared the larger universe of data. While this result has been documented by the scientific organization Berkeley Earth, it has yet to appear in one of the big climate journals, a sign that it might be having a rough time in the review process.   




That’s quite different than what was found in 2012 by two Greek hydrologists, E. Steirou and D. Koutsoyiannis, who analyzed a sample of weather stations used to calculate global temperature and found the adjustments were responsible for about half of the observed warming, when compared to the raw data. Their work was presented at the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union, but has not been published subsequently in the scientific literature. That’s not necessarily a knock on it, given the acrimonious nature of climate science, but it seems if it were an extremely robust, definitive paper, that it would have seen the light of day _somewhere_.   
  
But, before you cry “science scandal” based upon the Greek results, it’s a fact that one of the adjustments that has been commonly used—taking into account the biases introduced by the time of day in which the high and low temperatures for the previous 24 hours are recorded—in fact does induce warming into most records, a change that in fact is scientifically justified.   
  
In sum, I’d hold fire about “the biggest science scandal ever.” The facts are:   





"

_This is the first in a series of posts on global temperature records. The problems with surface thermometric records are manifold. Are there more reliable methods for measuring the temperature of the surface and the lower atmosphere?_   
  
Let’s face it, global surface temperature histories measured by thermometers are a mess. Recording stations come on- and offline seemingly at random. The time of day when the high and low temperatures for the previous 24 hours are recorded varies, often changing at the same station. This has a demonstrable biasing effect on high or low readings. Local conditions can further bias temperatures. What is the effect of a free-standing tree 100 feet away from a station growing into maturity? And the “urban heat island,” often very crudely accounted for, can artificially warm readings from population centers with as few as 2,500 residents. Neighboring reporting stations can diverge significantly from each other for no known reason.   
  
The list goes on. Historically, temperatures have been recorded by mercury-in-glass thermometers housed in a ventilated white box. But, especially in poorer countries, there’s little financial incentive to keep these boxes the right white, so they may darken over time. That’s guaranteed to make the thermometers read hotter than it actually is. And the transition from glass to electronic thermometers (which read different high temperatures) has hardly been uniform.   
  
Some of these problems are accounted for, and they produce dramatic alterations of original climate records (see here for the oft-noted New York Central Park adjustments) via a process called _homogenization_. Others, like the problem of station darkening, are not accounted for, even though there’s pretty good evidence that it is artificially warming temperatures in poor tropical nations.   








_Figure 1_. Difference between satellite-measured and ground-measured trends. Artificial warming is largest in the poor regions of Africa and South America. (Source: Figure 4 in McKitrick and Michaels, 2007).   
  
There are multiple “global” temperature histories out there, but they all look pretty much the same because they all run into the problems noted above, and while the applied solutions may be slightly different, they aren’t enough themselves to make the records look very different. The most recent one, from Berkeley Earth (originally called the Berkeley Earth Science Team (BEST) record) is noteworthy because it was generated from scratch (the raw data), but like all the others (all using the same data) it has a warming since 1979 (the dawn of the satellite-sensed temperature era) of around 0.18⁰C/decade. (Computer models, on average, say it should have been warming at around 0.25⁰C/decade.)   
  
They all have a problem with temperatures over the Arctic Ocean as there’s not much data. A recent fad has been to extend the land-based data out over the ocean, but that’s very problematic as a mixed ice-water ocean should have a boundary temperature of around freezing, while the land stations can heat up way above that. This extension is in no small part responsible for a recent jump in the global surface average.   
  
It would sure be desirable to have a global surface temperature record that suffered from none of the systematic problems noted above, and—to boot—would be measured by electronic thermometers precisely calibrated every time they were read.   
  
Such a dream exists, in the JRA-55 dataset. The acronym refers to the Japan Meteorological Office’s (originally) 55-year “reanalysis” data, and it updates to _yesterday_.   
  
Here’s how it works. Meteorologists around the world need a simultaneous three-dimensional “snapshot” of the earth’s physical atmosphere upon which to base the forecast for the next ten to sixteen days. So, twice a day, at 0000 and 1200 Greenwich Mean Time (0700 and 1900 EST) weather balloons are released, sensing temperature, pressure, and moisture, and tracked to determine the wind. There’s also satellite “profile” data in the mix, but obviously that wasn’t the case when JRA-55 began in 1958. These are then chucked into national (or private) computers that run the various weather forecast models, and the initial “analysis,” which is a three-dimensional map based upon the balloon data, provides a starting point for the weather forecast models.   
  
Once the analyzed data had served its forecasting purpose, it was largely forgotten, until it dawned upon people that this was _really good data_. And so there have been a number of what are now called “reanalysis” datasets. The most recent, and the most scientifically complete one is JRA-55. In a recent paper describing, in incredible detail, how it works, the authors conclude that it is more reliable than any of the previous versions, either designed by the Japan Office or elsewhere.   
  
Remember: the thermistors are calibrated at the release point, they are all launched at the same time, there’s no white box to get dirty, and the launch sites are largely in the same place. They aren’t subject to hokey homogenizations. And the reanalysis data has no gaps, using the laws of physics and a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model that generates physically realistic Arctic temperatures, rather than the statistical machinations used in the land-based histories that inflate warming over the Arctic Ocean.   
  
There is one possible confounding factor in that some of the launch sites are pretty close to built-up areas, or are in locations (airports) that tend to attract new infrastructure. That should mean that any warming in those places is likely to be a (very slight) overestimate.   
  
And so here is JRA-55 surface temperature departures from the 1981–2010 average:   




_  


![Media Name: michaels-20171129-2.jpg](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/michaels-20171129-2.jpg?itok=tphIlOwj)

_





_Figure 2._ Monthly JRA-55 data beginning in January, 1979, which marks the beginning of the satellite-sensed temperature record.   
  
The warming rate in JRA-55 until the 2015–16 El Niño is 0.10⁰C/decade, or about 40% of what has been forecast for the era by the average of the UN’s 106 climate model realizations. There’s no reason to think this is going to change much in coming decades, so it’s time to scale back the forecast warming for this century from the UN’s models—which is around 2.2⁰C using an emissions scenario reflecting the natural gas revolution. Using straight math, that would cut 21st century warming to around 0.9⁰C. Based upon a literature detailed elsewhere, that seems a bit low (and it also depends upon widespread substitution of natural gas for coal-based electricity).   
  
JRA-55 also has a rather obvious “pause” between the late 1990s and 2014, contrary to recent reports.   
  
The fact of the matter is that what should be the most physically realistic measure of global average surface temperature is also our coolest.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor whatever reason the following Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) press release was nowhere mentioned in the mainstream media.
And I was not able to find the report in an English version. So what follows is a professional translation. It’s indeed something the alarmists can put in their pipes and smoke on for awhile. My emphasis added:
==========================================
“Never so much sea ice at Antarctica in the last 30 years
15 October 2013
With respect to global warming it seems to be a paradox that this year sea ice in the Southern Ocean has reached the highest extent in the last decades. It was only in the mid 1970s that a similar sea ice extent had been observed.

Automatic measurement station for recording snow thickness on sea ice (snow buoy) in the polar night. Installed during the winter experiment (photo: Sandra Schwegmann, AWI).
The mean sea ice cover for September 2013 was 19.48 million square kilometers, an area that is 50 times the size of Germany. The absolute maximum of 19.65 million square kilometers was reached on September 18. And even if this maximum in sea ice cover area cannot be viewed similarly as a maximum in total volume or the total mass, sea ice physicist Marcel Nicolaus and Stefan Hendricks of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI): “There was more sea ice this winter than we’ve seen in a long time, if there ever was so much ice since the start of regular satellite observations.“
In order to be able to make more certain statements in the future, scientists of the Alfred Wegener Institute are currently working together with other colleagues of different institutes to also derive the thickness of the sea ice in the Antarctic from satellite observations. Recently this has become possible in the Arctic, but there are significant differences between the Arctic and Antarctic. The snow is thicker, more non-homogenous and it also does not melt completely in the summertime. Moreover much sea ice forms on the upper side, a phenomenon that takes place considerably more seldom in the Arctic. In the future it will be possible to calculate the volume of the sea ice there from the thickness and the extent.

The ice covered area of the Antarctic Ocean grows by a factor of 5 or 6 every year from its minimum of 3 to 4 million square kilometers to a maximum at the end of the winter (September) at the end of the Antarctic summer (February). However here there are large regional differences so that the Antarctic sea ice must be considered and evaluated as a puzzle made up of various ice covers.
Although over the last years an increase in ice cover has been observed in winter and summer as a whole, the tip of the Antarctic peninsula, for example, has been losing ice considerably, especially in the summer. While the Antarctic peninsula has warmed considerably over the last decades, the temperature in other regions remains stable.
These differences and the general increase in sea ice in many regions are for the most part the result of changes in the wind, which is spreading the ice apart. On the other hand, temperatures and winds from the Antarctic continent have a strong influence on the surrounding sea ice belt. That’s also a difference from the Arctic, and thus contributes to the sea ice in both polar regions behaving so differently.
To be able to better understand these interrelationships, over the last months, the AWI has conducted two winter experiments with the Polarstern research ice breaker in the Weddell Sea. In these expeditions the scientists encountered ever thicker and more compact ice which supports the claim of maximum ice mass. In addition to the measurements made during the journey, a number of automatic measurement stations were placed on the sea ice. These are now continuously measuring the thickness, temperature, and movement of the sea ice, as well as its snow cover, and they send the data via satellite to the AWI and its other project partners.
Reports, photos, maps and data of these experiments will shown and commented on here. More information is also available via the Steckbrief on the subject of sea ice as well as at the internet pages of the Sektion Meereisphysik (Section Sea Ice Physics).”
And in the AWI Fact Sheet Sektion Meereisphysik link, on page 2, they write:
“Even if there are no large area long-term measurements of sea ice thickness in the Antarctic, we conclude from various studies that the total volume of the Antarctic sea ice has grown over the last years.
The causes for these surprising observations are still the subject of various research projects. The main reason is currently suspected to be because of a strong natural variability as well as changes in the wind.”

Libertarians have mixed feelings toward Ronald Reagan. When we’re feeling positive, we remember that he used to say, “Libertarianism is the heart and soul of conservatism.”



Other times, we call to mind his military interventionism, his encouragement of the then‐​new religious right (“I know you can’t endorse me, but I endorse you.”), and his failure to really reduce the size of government. But the more experience we have with later presidents, the better Reagan looks in retrospect.



After a dispiriting era of stagflation, he revived American spirits and our faith in free enterprise. He slashed marginal tax rates and ushered in a “long boom.” Along with Margaret Thatcher, he both symbolized and galvanized a renewed enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and free markets. He shocked the



chattering classes in Washington and New York when he told the truth about communism: that it was a world of “totalitarian darkness” and a “sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written.” Even we anti‐​communists thought he was overly optimistic when he said that in 1983.



Edward H. Crane, the president of the Cato Institute, wrote in the _Wall Street Journal_ in 1988 that Reagan never paid much attention to the people he appointed to important positions in his administrations in Sacramento and Washington, thus undercutting his own efforts to implement his goals and policies. He appointed a lieutenant governor of California he’d barely met. He promised to abolish the departments of Energy and Education, then appointed secretaries who had no interest in carrying out that mission. And most particularly, he chose George Bush as his vice president and then endorsed him for the presidency. Perhaps Ronald Reagan’s worst legacy is 12 years of Bush presidencies.



Reagan had his faults. But he was an eloquent spokesman for a traditional American philosophy of individualism, self‐​reliance, and free enterprise at home and abroad, and words matter. They change the climate of opinion, and they inspire people trapped in illiberal societies. And these days, when people claiming the Reagan mantle push for wars or military involvement in Iraq, Iran, Georgia, and other danger spots, we remember that Reagan challenged the Soviet Union mostly in the realm of ideas; he used military force only sparingly. George W. Bush, whom some call “Reagan’s true political heir,” increased federal spending by more than a trillion dollars even before the financial crisis. We watch the antigay crusading of today’s conservative Republicans and remember that Reagan publicly opposed the early antigay Briggs Initiative of 1978 (featured in the movie _Milk_ ).



And in those moments we’re tempted to paraphrase the theme song of _All in the Family_ and say, “Mister, we could use a man like Ronald Reagan again.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterPerhaps some leading opinion-shapers in Germany have become aghast at the hysterical and hyper-irrational reaction coming from “climate scientists” in the wake of typhoon Yolanda, a single, destructive storm supposedly brewed by the misdeeds of darker forces, e.g. the 90 top carbon emitters of the world.
Despite the progress science and technology we’ve seen since the European Dark Ages centuries ago, the very same kind of madness seen back then seems to have found fertile ground in the minds of today’s leading figures – at least that’s what one leading book reviewer seems to be telling us.
A book review authored by Claudius Seidl appearing in Germany’s influential political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) on Sunday, carries the title: Witch hunting and climate change – The winter of the world. The book: The Victims of the Franconian Witchhunts.
The FAZ describes how a trove of 17th century records from the Franconian town of Bamberg survived and allowed a detailed reconstruction of the horrifying madness that terrorized one of Europe’s most idyllic settings, a region that had yet to escape old archaic structures and where the Renaissance had yet to arrive.
FAZ book reviewer Claudia Seidl writes:
In the 17th century in the middle of Germany, witches burned. The story of the bishop who initiated the witch hunt is of amazing relevance today.”
The accused had little chance of escaping the death sentence
The madness created an atmosphere of intense fear that pitted citizen against citizen, neighbor against neighbor. Not denouncing others meant the risk of being denounced by others.
The woman, who was viewed as a well-liked neighbor suddenly found herself accused of fornification with Satan, of having cooked children into a witch’s potion, and of having flown through the night sky on a broom as a storm blew. … Whoever stood accused had little chance of escaping the death sentence.”
As a result, in the early 17th century hundreds of “witches” met their fate at a fiery stake.

Witchhunts always occurred in times of extreme weather
Although the causes of the widespread madness are still debated today, one fact is clear:
The ‘witches’ were always accused of freezing the wine and wheat. They conjured up frosts and destructive hail, cold rains and storms that were so terrifying that no one could recall anything like it before.”
Today’s scientists are embarrassed to talk about it
During these dark times of madness and paranoia, the climate had changed almost instantly from the relatively pleasant conditions of the Medieval Warm Period to the deadly harshness of the Little Ice Age. Seidl writes:
The relationship between climate change and witch-hunting is evident. In all accusations, bad weather explained by magic – but when today’s scientists mention this relationship, they do so shamefacedly, discreetly, as if the whole matter is highly embarrassing. This is so because also with us, where we are studying and measuring climate change … we have gotten used to blaming the severity of storms and rains and the size of hail on global warming.”
Seidl asks today if in these more rational times we are “unable to exorcize these questions of faith and irrationality“.
Horrifying that people prefer subjugating themselves to madness rather than questioning it
Seidl concludes, writing, “it is horrifying when madness reigns how people prefer to subjugating themselves to it rather than questioning its basis.”
And he reminds us: “It was also the wealth of those burned that filled the coffers of the Church to the brim.”

"Global leaders must heed the lessons of the financial crisis of 2008 when they look to repair the damage from the coronavirus pandemic, leading experts have warned, to avoid entrenching disastrous social, health and environmental inequalities and hastening climate breakdown. The 2008 global financial crisis and recession marked the last time the world experienced a convulsion comparable in scale to the coronavirus crisis, though starkly different in its nature. Governments responded first with economic rescue and stimulus packages worth trillions in taxpayer cash, followed in many cases by austerity programmes to cut back public spending.  But the past decade has produced far greater levels of inequality than has been seen since before the second world war, producing starker contrasts between the extremely rich and the rest in health, job security, education and other measures, with poorer people suffering worst and the middle classes squeezed while the income of the top 1% soared. Greenhouse gas emissions have also risen, despite warnings from scientists and the Paris agreement of 2015, threatening an even worse crisis if governments do not rapidly change tack. The rise came despite some efforts to “green” the post financial crisis recovery, with low-carbon and environmental measures accounting for about 16% of the stimulus. To avoid a similar outcome this time, leaders must ensure their response to the Covid-19 crisis looks to the good of the whole of society, rather than just the economy, and addresses the climate emergency as well, said Sir Michael Marmot, who led the landmark UK review of public health that found life expectancy fell following austerity. “The scale of what is happening in the economy now is hugely greater than in 2008,” he told the Guardian. “We need to bring the climate agenda and the health agenda together. If we are not careful, the steps we take now will increase inequalities further. Enough people are saying now that austerity is not an experiment we want to repeat.” Marmot is one of the leading voices calling for a “green recovery” that would direct any economic stimulus towards measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as generating jobs and repairing the economy. The economic stimulus in the years after 2008 did produce some environmental improvements such as investments in renewable energy, which have cut the cost of solar and wind power. But the push to cut emissions was stymied by factors such as the sharp fall in the carbon price under the EU’s emissions trading scheme, and China’s construction push. This time can be different, argues Lord Nicholas Stern, one of the world’s leading climate economists and author of the landmark 2006 review of the costs of climate change. “Technology is completely different now. We have seen the costs of key technologies such as renewable energy come right down. We have altogether superior electric vehicle technology. And we know more about air pollution, and how many people it kills.” Putting money into the fossil fuel economy would be a waste, he added. “That produces insecurity. If we do things that leave stranded assets [in fossil fuel businesses], we also have stranded jobs.” Yet talking about environmental measures in the midst of an economic crisis may not be popular, and could be seized on by populist opponents of climate action. The gilets jaunes protests in France were sparked by a rise in fuel taxes that had a particular impact on poorer workers in rural areas. Those protests had roots far deeper than just the fuel tax, some extending back to the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but some experts fear they show how green measures can be presented as contrary to working people’s interests. “The gilets jaunes show there is a lesson to learn,” says Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the most influential global voices on energy economics. “I am afraid there will be a divergence among policymakers – they will see [a choice between] either jobs or climate change. It’s very important that we put policies in place that help to create jobs and stimulate a clean energy transition.” Leading economists are hopeful, however, that those mistakes can be avoided and that the world will turn to “build back better” instead of pouring resources into fossil fuels. “Focus on what we already know works,” said Birol. That means clean energy, such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency. “Then focus on technologies that are ready for the big time – hydrogen [energy] and batteries. Third, we need sustained political support.” The green recovery now has a rigorous intellectual underpinning, in the form of a paper by Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, Stern and others, published earlier this month. The paper examined the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and found that putting public money into green projects produced greater returns in both the short and long term than pouring cash into conventional high-carbon projects. That is crucial, according to Brian O’Callaghan, of the Smith School for Enterprise at Oxford University and co-author of the study, because governments want “shovel-ready” projects that produce a lot of jobs quickly, that do not need too high levels of existing skills or extensive training, and that provide infrastructure that benefit the economy. Retrofitting buildings, working on cities to make them more friendly to cyclists and pedestrians, digging trenches for broadband connections, putting in networks for charging electric vehicles, and planting trees are all examples of “shovel-ready” projects that could create jobs in the short term and reduce emissions permanently, according to Stern. “These are things that can be done quickly, and they are labour intensive.” “Policymakers have time to design policy that both accelerates our economic recovery and reduces inequality,” said O’Callaghan. “It is time to rethink economic stimulus. This spending should be about more than just increasing next year’s GDP. Once-in-a-generation government spending could be used to reduce inequality and set up new industries for the coming decade.”"

With stormy midterm elections just ahead, and much of President Obama’s agenda still undone, the last thing congressional Democrats needed is the distraction of a difficult and protracted Supreme Court confirmation battle.



Yet that’s likely what’s in store after Friday’s announcement that Justice John Paul Stevens, the court’s liberal lion, is stepping down in late June. The party’s base, already disappointed with Mr. Obama, will doubtless press the president for a liberal replacement. But with the growing “tea party” movement raising long‐​ignored constitutional issues, even a moderate nominee will face questions congressional Democrats would rather leave buried.



Chief among those is that most basic question, brought to the fore by “ObamaCare”: Are there any longer any constitutional limits on federal power?





Are there any longer any constitutional limits on federal power?



If Congress can reorder one‐​sixth of the nation’s economy, command states to establish insurance exchanges, and require individuals to buy insurance from private companies or face a tax, it would seem not. Yet the 19 states presently challenging such sweeping power will find little comfort in the decisions of Justice Stevens.



Coming of age during the New Deal, Stevens’s jurisprudence more often than not has reflected the dominant themes of that era: judicial deference to broad assertions of government power, especially over the economy, coupled with seemingly inconsistent assertions of judicial power to ignore the law in deference to “evolving social values,” all of which has given us modern “constitutional law” — not to be confused with the Constitution.



The Founders gave us a Constitution aimed at securing individual liberty through limited government, with most power resting in the states or, even more, in the private sector.



It wasn’t perfect, to be sure: In fact, it took a civil war to end slavery, and the Civil War Amendments to make the Bill of Rights good against the states. And there never was a “Golden Age,” as Jim Crow, Prohibition, and much else attest.



But from the start, the main idea was clear: Whatever the nation’s faults in practice, the point of life was to live it, freely, not dependent on government. Indeed, answering anti‐​Federalists’ fears that the new national government would be too powerful, Federalists detailed exquisitely the Constitution’s limits on federal power. Neither camp could have imagined anything like ObamaCare.



Well, all that changed when the social engineers of the Progressive Era, steeped in visions of the “public good,” came finally to power under Franklin Roosevelt.



When the “nine old men” on the court balked, saying the Constitution prohibited FDR’s schemes, the president threatened to pack the court with six new members. The plan failed, but the court got the message.



It turned the Constitution on its head, and the modern welfare state was born. A watershed moment came in 1942, when the court interpreted the Commerce Clause as giving Congress virtually unlimited authority over economic activity.



The result today is unfunded liabilities no one knows how to meet, debt as far as the eye can see, and taxes in the offing that will cripple individuals and businesses alike — quite apart from the restraints on liberty that dependency on government entails.



In 1995, the Supreme Court took a tiny step toward braking this juggernaut when it ruled that the Gun‐​Free Zones Act of 1990 exceeded Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. The power to address that issue belongs to states, the court held, not to Congress. Stevens dissented, calling the decision “radical.”



Five years later, facing similar issues, he dissented again. But in 2005, facing a challenge to Congress’s prohibition on home‐​grown medical marijuana administered under state law, Stevens wrote at last for the majority, upholding Congress’s ability, under the Commerce Clause, to ban the drug and override state law, and effectively reversing the Rehnquist Court’s meager efforts to put a brake on Congress’s all but unbounded regulatory power.



That decision sets the stage, unfortunately, for the 19 states challenging ObamaCare today.



But Stevens hasn’t always favored federal power over states and individuals.



A year ago, for example, in a case pitting the Food and Drug Administration’s power to regulate prescription drug warning labels against state court awards to injured plaintiffs, he ignored the clause of the Constitution that makes federal law supreme and ruled for the plaintiff.



And in 2007 he entertained Al Gore‐​like claims about rising sea levels over the next century, thus ignoring rules about standing meant to keep mere speculative claims out of court. That enabled Massachusetts to get into court, where Stevens relied on still more dubious claims to rule against the Environmental Protection Agency’s earlier finding that it had no authority to regulate greenhouse gases.



Turning from limiting power to protecting rights, Stevens’s record is mixed, to be sure, but on several hot‐​button issues it could cause difficulties for Democrats in the upcoming Senate confirmation hearings.



Take guns and the Second Amendment: In a blockbuster decision two years ago, the court held, for the first time, that individuals had a right to own handguns for self‐​defense in the home. Stevens wrote the dissent.



Or take property rights: In the infamous Kelo decision of 2005, Stevens wrote for the court’s majority, holding that the city of New London, Conn., could transfer the title to Suzette Kelo’s home to a private developer who promised upscale building on the land, thereby generating more taxes for the city. Here again Stevens ignored the plain language of the Constitution to reach a result he thought socially desirable. That decision produced such a backlash that over 40 states subsequently tightened their eminent domain laws.



In other areas, too — abortion, campaign finance, affirmative action, the death penalty — Stevens has written or joined opinions that are likely, in the current climate, to pose difficulties for congressional Democrats seeking reelection. By and large, they reflect a bias toward government. And that is inconsistent not only with the times but with the Constitution. Yet that’s what Democrats may find themselves defending as the confirmation process unfolds.

“America faces a new culture war,” declares Arthur Brooks, president of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, in the opening sentence of his new book _The Battle: How the Fight between Free Enterprise and Big Government Will Shape America’s Future_. “This is not the culture war of the 1990s. This is not a fight over guns, abortions, religion, or gays. … Rather, it is a struggle between two competing visions of America’s future. In one, America will continue to be a unique and exceptional nation organized around the principles of free enterprise. In the other, America will move toward European‐​style statism.”



And who, according to Brooks, are the combatants in this conflict? Wearing the white hats, “70 percent of Americans support the free enterprise system and are unsupportive of big government.” Wearing black hats, meanwhile, is what Brooks calls “the 30 percent coalition”: the “intellectual upper class” of academics, journalists, and well‐​educated professionals; African‐​Americans and Hispanics; and the young. In other words, pretty much the usual suspects from culture wars gone by.



Although he mentions the Tea Party movement only in passing, Brooks’ call to arms is very much in the spirit of that populist uprising. He seeks to “rally the 70 percent majority in the battle for the soul of America”: In other words, as the Tea Partiers often put it, it’s time for “real Americans” to “take our country back.” Just as the protesters vent their fury at coastal elites and, especially, elitist‐​in‐​chief Barack Obama, so too does Brooks. “The intellectual upper class has become the most important party in the 30 percent coalition — the chief adversary of the free enterprise system today,” he writes. “And at the head of the intellectual upper class are our current leaders in Washington DC — starting with activist, bestselling author, and Ivy League academic, President Barack Obama.”



Let me make it clear at the outset: When it comes to specific questions of economic policy, Brooks and I probably agree on a great deal. Indeed, I’d bet that my opinions are much closer to his than they are to the typical reader of _The American Prospect_. I thought that the stimulus bill was, by and large, a waste of money, and the takeover of General Motors and Chrysler, a travesty. I opposed the recent health‐​care legislation and the climate bill and card‐​check legislation. Hey, I’m a vice president at the Cato Institute, so none of this should come as a big surprise.



But Brooks’ book isn’t about policy; it’s about ideology and how to engage in politics. And it is, I’m sorry to say, a thoroughly wrongheaded way to approach these questions. The attempt to turn economic policy disputes into a populist cultural crusade rests on deep‐​seated confusion about the nature of those disputes and how best to effect constructive policy change. Brooks’ key move is to cast our “free enterprise system” as an instance of American exceptionalism — in contrast to the social democracy of Europe and other advanced nations. Thus, economic policy becomes fodder for cultural politics: Supporters of free markets are defending a unique and precious American heritage, while members of the “30 percent coalition” have thrown in with the foreigners — worst of all, with effete, decadent Europeans.



To treat Brooks’ narrative seriously, it’s helpful to break down the concept of the “free enterprise system” into two separate and distinct elements. The first is free markets; the second, small government. They need not be a package deal. Governments can effectively stifle enterprise and competition without spending a lot of money, while a large public sector and a vibrant private sector can go hand in hand. So let’s look at each component separately.



First, free markets. Is Brooks’ distinction between all‐​American freedom and European‐​style statism a valid one? And here at home, do elites really support the state while everyone else supports the market? No and no. When it comes to establishing and maintaining open and competitive markets, the U.S. institutional and policy environment isn’t really that exceptional at all. Meanwhile, elites are actually more likely to support free‐​market policies than is the American demos.



Plenty of European countries have markets about as free as those in the land of the free. Look at the ratings provided by the annual _Economic Freedom of the World_ report, co‐​published by the Cato Institute. On four broad categories of economic freedom — legal structure and security of property rights; access to sound money; freedom to trade internationally; and regulation –. the United States was slightly “freer” than Sweden, the United Kingdom, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland. Meanwhile, Ireland, the Netherlands and, by a wide margin, Denmark were found to have freer markets. Note that the two highest scorers have two of the biggest welfare states in the world — which just goes to show that blurring issues of regulation and redistribution, as Brooks tries to do, leads to intellectual confusion.



So much for American exceptionalism in actual policy results. Meanwhile, how market‐​friendly is American public opinion? Not very, according to economist Bryan Caplan. In his book _The Myth of the Rational Voter_ , Caplan documents the existence of strong and widespread anti‐​market biases in the American electorate — in other words, sharp divergences between public opinion and the accepted view among most economists. Thus, ordinary voters are more likely to say a price increase was caused by intentional gouging rather than the interaction of supply and demand; they are more likely to blame problems in the economy on companies downsizing or “shipping jobs overseas”; and they tend to underestimate recent economic gains and express more pessimism about the future. On the other hand, the better educated are more likely to think like economists and see such changes as unavoidable. So it looks like Brooks actually gets things backward here: From a free‐​market perspective, the dreaded intellectual upper class is more solution than problem.



Brooks’ narrative works somewhat better with respect to conflicts over the size of government. Here, at least, there is a clear distinction between the United States and Europe. Levels of social welfare spending in Europe are generally much higher than they are in the U.S..



Does America’s smaller welfare state reflect important cultural differences between us and folks on the other side of the Atlantic? Yes, probably, but the main one is hardly worthy of defending. A 2001 paper, _Why Doesn’t the United States Have a European‐​Style Welfare State?_ by economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser, and Bruce Sacerdote, provides powerful evidence that race is at the center of the story. There’s a strong negative relationship between a country’s racial heterogeneity and its levels of social spending, and within the U.S., states with larger black populations spend less on welfare programs. “Americans think of the poor as members of some different group than themselves, while Europeans think of the poor as members of their group,” the paper concludes.



Don’t get me wrong: I’m no fan of the European welfare state. There are sound economic reasons for rejecting it as a model. Most decisively, the aging of the population and the continued development of promising but expensive medical treatments are rendering it unaffordable, and fiscal constraints will sooner or later lead to significant restructuring here as well.



But Brooks doesn’t want to use _economic_ arguments. He counsels against “getting stuck in the old arguments over money.” Instead, he wants to defend America’s track record of more modest social spending on _cultural_ grounds. And that is a really bad idea. Our tragic history of race relations may have inhibited spending, but we should be ashamed of that cultural heritage. We certainly shouldn’t embrace it and brag about it. Brooks apparently doesn’t realize what he’s doing; he thinks he’s touting good old Yankee self‐​reliance. But his argument is offensive even if he’s oblivious to how offensive he’s being.



In any event, it’s not anti‐​poverty programs that are threatening to send the U.S. budget spiraling out of control. Rather, it’s the middle‐​class entitlements, Social Security, and especially Medicare. And you can’t blame those programs on the machinations of the dastardly “30 percent coalition,” because they are overwhelmingly popular across the electorate. According to an April _New York Times_ poll, 76 percent of Americans think “the benefits from government programs such as Social Security and Medicare are worth the costs of those programs.” And amazingly, the percent only drops to 62 when the sample is restricted to the 18 percent of people who say they support the Tea Party movement!



Here again, Brooks’ effort to turn economic policy problems into “us versus them” cultural conflicts collapses in failure. On the vexing question of how to defuse the entitlements fiscal time bomb, there is no “us” and “them.” The politics of us versus them is almost always ugly and illiberal. And on the policy questions that Brooks is concerned with, there’s no need for such deliberate divisiveness. Yes, there are strong disagreements about market regulation and the proper size and scope of social spending, but these disagreements are not based on some irreconcilable differences in values. Vigorous support for continued economic growth is nearly universal across the political spectrum. How else will we put jobless Americans back to work, and how else will we pay for the activities of government, without a strong, dynamic private sector? A similarly broad consensus exists for the following two propositions: On the one hand, a government safety net is needed to protect Americans from various hazards of life; on the other hand, that safety net shouldn’t bankrupt us.



Figuring out how to restore growth and how to construct an effective but affordable safety net, are questions for debate, analysis, and democratic decision‐​making. My answers to those questions may differ from yours, but dividing up into warring tribes and demonizing each other aren’t the ways to figure out who’s right.

Mike Smith (Ngapuhi, Ngati Kahu), of Change Iwi Leaders Group, has lodged proceedings in the High Court against seven companies he claims are failing to protect Maori from climate change (never mind about the rest of us). 



“Maori are particularly vulnerable to climate change, being Disproportionately represented amongst the poor, who will be the hardest hit. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, flooding and storm surges will irrevocably damage low lying coastal communities, and warming oceans and ocean acidification will damage traditional resources, including fisheries.”



  
Waah waah, waah. This would be funny if it wasn’t such a waste of time and money. As dear ol’ dad would say, some people have more dollars than sense, and to drive this point home, Smith dropped his legal action bomb before swanning off to Mexico for an indigenous people’s talkfest. Talk, talk, talk, spend, spend, spend.



Defending themselves against the trumped up charges are Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, Genesis Energy Ltd, Dairy Holdings Ltd, NZ Steel Ltd, Z Energy Ltd, The NZ Refining Company Ltd and BT Mining Ltd. 



Already on the receiving end of legislation from a government hostile to farming and mining, these companies must now fund their defence, which they need as much as anyone needs another hole in their head.



Strange isn’t it, that government and Iwi have endless money to fund their trivial pursuits that include attacking the lifeblood of the country, biting the hand that feeds them.



“While Smith acknowledged the Government’s efforts in enacting the Zero Carbon Act, he said steps to tackle climate change do not go far enough and he is asking the Courts to intervene.



The urgency of climate change means we need far greater action and we need it now, and not just from government but also across the private sector” he says. 



“It’s not good enough just to set far off targets, especially ones  
that let our biggest polluters like the agricultural sector off the  
hook so they can have a bit more time to turn a profit. The fact is  
we are out of time and are now looking at damage control.” 



The litigation seeks relief including a declaration that the companies have acted unlawfully, and an injunction requiring each of them to reduce total net greenhouse gases by half by 2030, and to zero by 2050, or to otherwise cease their emitting activities immediately.” 



Smith has money (and hopes for a great deal more from his court case) but no scientific leg to stand on after a landmark climate change court case was decided in favour of scientist and climate change sceptic Dr Tim Ball of Canada.



Ball was sued for libel for claiming the “hockey stick” graph, crucial to the IPCC climate change doom and gloom predictions, is scientific rubbish. Just over a week ago [Ball was exonerated from the libel charges and awarded court costs](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/08/22/breaking-dr-tim-ball-wins-michaelemann-lawsuit-mann-has-to-pay/). The case hinged on the pro-climate change scientists refusing to cough up the data supporting their argument which Ball claimed did not stand up to scrutiny. 



The news that climate change is officially a hoax will take some time to topple the huge financial industry of climate change, and reach our green and not so tranquil shores of mainstream media gullibility. Until it does, we can take pleasure in mocking the fools still cashing in on the myth of rising sea levels and the death of life as we know it. Idiots.

"**Staff in the Belfast Health Trust are being asked whether or not they want to receive the Covid vaccine.**
The BBC has seen an email and questionnaire sent to all employees telling them workers will receive the Pfizer vaccine.
Trade unions say they are encouraging front-line workers to get the vaccine but everyone should be given a choice.
Another 10 Covid-related deaths and 290 new cases were reported by Stormont's Department of Health on Monday.
It brings the department's death toll - which consists of deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 996.
The email sent to all staff at the Belfast Trust goes on to say that further guidance will be issued in the coming days on how to book a time and venue to get the first jab.
""It is crucial we plan our clinics appropriately to ensure everyone is able to receive both vaccinations,"" the trust says.
Vaccinating up to 100,000 health care staff is going to be one of the biggest civilian healthcare operations that Northern Ireland has ever seen.
If the Pfizer vaccine gets the official go-ahead this week, staff could receive the first of their jabs within a fortnight.
That vaccine requires two separate injections a number of weeks apart.
Kevin McAdam, Unite's regional officer, said: ""The whole concept of what we are trying to do is frankly scary, but doable. We need all shoulders to the wheel.
""I don't think it's helpful to make it mandatory for health service staff. That would not be helpful. We have always resisted that for flu vaccine.""
The roll out of Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccination programme could begin by mid-December, BBC News NI understands.
It is widely anticipated that the regulatory body will approve two vaccines this week, which will allow the plans to become official.
A digital booking system for healthcare workers is also being set up.
Timings will be critical as people receiving their vaccine will have to socially distance and be monitored for 15 minutes afterwards.
This is to ensure there are no physical reactions.
Rolling out any Covid-19 vaccine is a ""large logistical operational challenge,"" the Health Minister Robin Swann told MLAs on Monday.
""One of the biggest challenges being the AstraZeneca vaccine comes in batches of 975 vials per pack. And it will be highly challenging if not impossible to break that down into smaller packs,"" said Mr Swann.
""So, it is a vaccine that is designed for mass vaccination and mass vaccination centres which are going to put that initial challenge on the delivery of our vaccine programme in Northern Ireland.""
Undoubtedly there remains a raft of unknowns about the rollout of the vaccines but BBC News NI understands health officials are using mid-December as a working date in their attempts to pull plans together.
Once the regulatory medicines body, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), gives the vaccines the go-ahead, a move widely anticipated to happen this week, plans around accepting, storing and delivering them will be firmed up.
It is thought Oxford's AstraZenica vaccine - the more easily stored of the two - will be used by GPs to vaccinate those aged 80 and over, while Pfizer's vaccine will be rolled out among healthcare staff and residents of care homes.
It requires much tighter controls around storage and, while healthcare staff will be required to attend the likes of leisure centres to be vaccinated, it is thought that visiting pods in care homes could be used to vaccinate residents.
By starting vaccinations mid-December, the required three-week gap means the second boost will be delivered around the first week of 2021.
In order to roll out the programme, a lot more vaccinators are required.
They will be able to administer the vaccine and may come out of medical retirement to boost numbers.
A background in healthcare, however, is not thought to be required.
It has also emerged that several doctors in Northern Ireland have taken part in the Oxford vaccine trial."

What is faith?



A dictionary definition is, “ _The assent of the mind to the truth of a proposition or statement for_ ** _which there is not complete evidence_** _; belief in general. Specifically, firm belief based upon_ ** _confidence in the authority and veracity of another,_** _rather than upon one’s own knowledge, reason, or judgement._ “



The biblical definition of faith is given in Hebrews 11:1, “ _Faith means being sure of the things we hope for and_ ** _knowing that something is real even if we do not see it_** _._ ” (NCV) 



Dr Roy Spencer looks at faith in the context of the current ‘climate emergency’ in a post on his blog. He sets out three basic fundamentals:



So the tool the climate scientists use are computer models.



When computer climate models are first constructed, these global-average energy flows in and out of the climate system do not balance. So, modellers adjust any number of uncertain processes in the models (for example, cloud parameterizations) until they do balance. They run the model for, say, 100 years and make sure there is little or no long-term temperature trend to verify balance exists.



Then, they add the infrared radiative effect of increasing CO2, which does cause an energy imbalance. Warming occurs. They then say something like, “See? The model proves that CO2 is responsible for warming we’ve seen since the 1950s.”  




 **But they have only demonstrated what they assumed from the outset.** It is circular reasoning. A tautology. Evidence that nature also causes global energy imbalances is abundant: e.g., the strong warming before the 1940s; the Little Ice Age; the Medieval Warm Period. This is why many climate scientists try to purge these events from the historical record, to make it look like only humans can cause climate change. 



His conclusion is that we cannot say whether or not CO2 causes global warming or how much it may or may not cause because we simply have we have no idea what natural energy imbalances exist in the climate system. The modellers simply assume they do not exist. 



There is no possible way to distinguish ‘natural’ warming from ‘human induced’ warming. Warming is warming – it does not come in different colours or flavours.



The whole global warming / climate change / climate emergency issue is an article of faith.

"About 12,000 years ago, human domestication of the natural world began in earnest with the intentional cultivation of wild plants and animals. Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force. Yet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.  Covid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets. “Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great diversity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”. The risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization. Wildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the Guardian and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state. Wildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier. Paradise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.” Even so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG&E transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware. Paradise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world.  We’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the Guardian only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks. Yet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight. On our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise. Alastair Gee and Dani Anguiano are the authors of Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy, available from WW Norton on 5 May. Read an excerpt here"

According to Dr. Clive Best, A key prediction from the 2007 IPCC WG1 report fails statistical tests.

AR4 figure for long term predictions for each scenario
Abstract: Global temperatures measured since 2005 are incompatible with the IPCC model predictions made in 2007 by WG1 in AR4. All subsequent temperature data from 2006 to 2011 lies between 1 and 6 standard deviations below the model predictions. The data show with > 90%  confidence level that the models have over-exaggerated global warming.

Background: In 200o an IPCC special report proposed several future economic scenarios each with a different CO2 emission profile. For the 2007 assessment report these scenarios were used to model predictions for future global temperatures. The results for each of the scenarios were then used to lobby governments. It would appear that as a result of these predictions, there is  one favoured scenario – namely B1 which alone is capable of limiting temperature rises to 2 degrees.

When the Soviet Union sank, human liberty dramatically increased. The great totalitarian tyranny that had consumed millions of its own apparatchiks and tens of millions of its other citizens was gone.



However, the initial years of chaotic liberty have been replaced by ever more stifling authoritarianism. The negative impact has been most obviously felt in the political realm. According to last year’s State Department human rights assessment: “There were numerous reports of governmental and societal human rights problems and abuses during the year.” The list of examples is long and distressing. 





The Moscow authorities have demonstrated that they don’t care much what foreigners, or even most Russians, think.



Freedom House rates Moscow as “not free.”



The country holds elections but, says Freedom House, “is not an electoral democracy.” Freedom House offers a similar list of human rights abuses, including restrictions on the media, pervasive corruption, limits on freedom of assembly and association, and a subservient judiciary.



Unfortunately, religious liberty also is coming under pressure. The Russian constitution formally protects religious freedom and equality, but, noted the State Department last fall, “the government did not always respect those provisions.” There long have been some limits to this most basic freedom. 



Freedom House explained:





The State Department made many of the same points. It explained that there was “generally free practice of religion for most of the population,” but some religious minorities found their rights to be restricted. State also pointed to the 1997 legislation “On Freedom of Conscience and Association,” warning that its provisions “continued to seriously disadvantage some religious groups viewed as non‐​traditional.” The Federal Security Service (FSS), which has replaced the FBI, increasingly has viewed some faiths as threats to Russian security.



Moreover, the government is increasingly using the Extremism Law passed in June 2002 to persecute nontraditional religions. A group of U.S. religious leaders recently raised the alarm about this dangerous trend in a letter to the president. 



Undoubtedly, examples of dangerous extremism exist in Russia. However, the legislation bans far more than violent groups. For instance, the definition of extremism includes “public defamation of any person on duty holding a public office in the Russian Federation” and “infringement on life of a public official or community leader committed with a view of termination of his public or other political activity.”



In March a court in the city of Surgut upheld the seizure of Scientology books and materials as “extremist.” It was an ex parte hearing, at which the church was not represented. The Church of Scientology had previously been denied the right to register under the 1997 law, which requires groups with more than 15 years in the country to sign up as religious organizations. 



The Scientologists are not the only victims of the law. The federal list of Extremist Materials to which their publications were added includes nearly 600 publications. 



Muslim literature has been denounced as “extremist” because it “propagandizes the idea of the superiority of Islam — and therefore Muslims — over other religions and the people who adhere to them.” Last fall the Russian Supreme Court upheld a government ban on publications of the Jehovah’s Witnesses as extremist. The local organization was ordered liquidated and its property was seized. 



Unfortunately, these are merely the tip of an iceberg of growing repression. The American religious leaders explained to President Obama: 





The result is what the letter‐​writers call “an increasingly hostile environment” for non‐​traditional faiths, resulting “in investigations, armed raids, nation‐​wide bans on certain religious literature that had been published and read worldwide for decades, and even dissolutions and liquidations of religious organizations.” An incredible 2,000 religious organizations were subject to liquidation for failing to reregister after the year 2000. Moreover, churches have increasingly cited increased bureaucratic oversight and regulation. The State Department noted that “Many non‐​traditional denominations frequently complained that they were unable to obtain venues for worship.” 



Finally, attacks on individual faiths and congregations have been escalating. The Oslo‐​based Forum 18 News Service explained: “The formation of Russia’s policy towards one particular form of extremism — religious extremism — may have begun hesitantly.” However, passage of the 2002 legislation “eventually led to a wide‐​ranging crackdown on religious literature the authorities deemed ‘extremist’.” Religious organizations increasingly have come under attack in other ways as well. 



Forum 18 compiled a long list of disturbing incidents beginning in mid‐​2007:



It’s an imposing list. But there are more examples. Many religions and individual congregations have suffered from a raid, prosecution, banning, dissolution, arrest, penalty, restriction, seizure, investigation, confiscation, detention, or other attack from the state authorities. Non‐​traditional, proselytizing faiths have suffered the most.



The European Court of Human Rights has become the final resort for some desperate Russians. In October 2006 the justices ruled for the Salvation Army. A year later the ECHR supported the Church of Scientology. Last October it again ruled against Russia and in favor of the Scientologists. In June the ECHR held that a 2004 ban on the Moscow’s Jehovah’s Witnesses violated articles on freedom of thought, conscience, worship, and assembly of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been ratified by Russia.



In the latter case the court stated that “the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality.” Moreover, the government had interfered with “the religious organization’s right to freedom of association and also with its right to freedom of religion.”



Unfortunately, Russia does not treat decisions of the ECHR as authoritative.



Not every religion is disabled to the same degree. The Orthodox Church enjoys privileged status, which it has used against other faiths. In June the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) warned “that the de facto favored status of the Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox Church results in difficulties for minority religious communities, particularly those officially deemed non‐​traditional.”



Moreover, the Orthodox Church recently used its preferential status to encourage a blasphemy prosecution against a contemporary art exhibition entitled “Forbidden Art” held at the Sakharov museum. The government is seeking a three year jail term for organizers, a haunting throwback to Soviet restrictions on contemporary art.



In June the USCIRF warned that “Many Russian officials also proclaim that certain religious and ethnic groups are alien to Russian culture and society, thereby contributing to a climate of intolerance. In general, the Russian government has failed to address consistently or effectively the severe and chronic problem of violent and sometimes lethal hate crimes and anti‐​Semitism. Numerous acts of vandalism against synagogues, churches, and mosques also go largely unpunished or are attributed to hooliganism.”



Obviously, Washington’s influence over Moscow’s internal policies is limited. Nevertheless, U.S. government officials, religious leaders, and human rights activists can offer the same simple message as the religious leaders who wrote the president: “The Russian Government should make good on Russian guarantees of freedom of religion and association for every individual and religious community, and it should honor its international human rights obligations and commitments.”



The Moscow authorities have demonstrated that they don’t care much what foreigners, or even most Russians, think. But the controversy could embarrass the Putin/​Medvedev government, tarnishing the regime’s image. Since religious restrictions — in contrast to political repression — don’t strengthen Vladimir Putin’s hold on power, maybe even he would come to see the value of offering religious believers a little more space.

Nigel Farage in Australia this week spoke about the international trend away from globalism and toward nationalism or **self-determination** since 2016. The US, Italy, Spain, Austria, the UK and Australia have all moved in that direction.



Ardern was in Tokelau recently when she saw the opportunity for NZ to fund an airstrip. I’d prefer that Ardern, as keeper of the national purse, adopt a more accountable, nationalist based attitude toward others, given our healthcare and housing needs at home. 



For those of us who want to cut globalism loose and prioritise New Zealanders before helping other nations, which parties provide the strongest platform?



On equality regardless of sex, race, age or religion, only ACT and New Conservatives promise to remove our existing race-based Maori seats. “NC believes the Treaty of Waitangi – Te Tiriti o Waitangi ensures the same rights and privileges are available for everyone.”



The Nats would remove us from the UN Global Migration Pact – big ups to Simon Bridges and The National party. 



On addressing the loss of traditional NZ values through migration, ACT recognises the potential problem and says “new migrants should be willing to adapt to and endorse New Zealand’s values”, but doesn’t say how ACT would achieve it. New Conservative goes further, saying they would ensure **“there is no acceptance or allowance of Sharia Law, in any expression, as well as any non-constitutional jurisdictional authority, in New Zealand”.**



On gun law, National supported the government’s 2019 reforms, and ACT was the only party to vote against it. The New Conservatives would amend the badly crafted Prohibited Arms Act 2019, with an amended version of banned “E” category firearms and a new five-year residency condition for firearm ownership. New Conservative would also increase sentences for violent, firearm-related and sexual crimes.



On climate change, the New Conservatives are **the only party who would pull out of the Kyoto and Paris Agreements** , saying they would instead invest the money into much-needed R&D at home.



Both the National Party and ACT support the UN climate change agenda, but ACT would scale down our financial contributions by tying our carbon price to the prices paid in our top five trading partners.



 **On free speech ACT’s David Seymour has been a lone but loud voice in the house.**



On Israel, the Nats lost voters when they supported UN Security Council Resolution 2334 concerning the Israeli settlements in “Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”. Later Simon Bridges did a u-turn and admitted they got this wrong, but then negated his newfound insight by unnecessarily reiterating “Israel [doesn’t get] a free pass to act disproportionately against Human Rights” **.**



At the time David Seymour and Winston Peters criticized the government for supporting the resolution and Peters felt strongly enough about it to insert a clause into the Labour-NZ First coalition agreement saying the new government “will record a Cabinet minute regarding the **lack of process** followed before the National-led government’s sponsorship of UNSC2334”.



The New Conservatives go much further, promising to open a NZ embassy, recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, apologise for Resolution 2334 and strengthen our ties with Israel.



The party that ticks most boxes of interest to me is New Conservative but their first hurdle is achieving 5%, and after that entering into a coalition agreement that doesn’t strip them of their core values, remembering that MMP can turn any party into muppets.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung reports the latest development on the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) scandal.
Recently Germany’s version of the Environmental Protection Agency (UBA) published a 120-page brochure that publicly named and branded renowned skeptic US and German journalists and scientists because they “did not conform to the level of climate science knowledge“.

Minister of Bullying? Environment Minister Peter Altmaier defends blacklist. Photo credit: Rudolf Simon, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Two of the science journalists named in the UBA brochure are Michael Miersch, editor at FOCUS, and Dirk Maxeiner. The Süddeutsche Zeitung asks in its commentary whether it’s okay “for the state to publicly brand them” and if it is “the function of a state agency to grade the work of journalists and to do so publicly?
Journalists suing Environment Ministry
The Süddeutsche Zeitung writes that the story has now entered the legal phase, with journalists Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxeiner suing the German Environment Ministry for refusing to cease and desist distributing the controversial brochure. The Süddeutsche writes:
They are taking the matter to court because the agency has refused to sign a cease and desist declaration, and is continuing to distribute the brochure in the Internet. He doesn’t want to be ‘officially stamped as not serious‘, said Miersch. Moreover, the science journalist is annoyed that the agency wants to end the debate on climate change: ‘Declaring a debate ended goes against the spirit of science. Anyone who says that the end of the debate has been reached is peddling theology.'”
Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, whose Ministry oversees the UBA, defended the brochure. The Süddeutsche Zeitung quotes Altmaier insisting that the Ministry “is not imposing any thought, speech, writing or other ban.” Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier told Welt am Sonntag that he saw “no reason for criticism” and: “We are simply saying that from time to time there are positions that do not agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists.”
Bad enough that Altmaier doesn’t see anything false with wrongly ruining reputations, but he also appears totally misinformed here. Perhaps someone forgot to tell him about all the scientific papers out there showing that the science is more disputed than ever, and that Cook’s 97% consensus-claiming paper is fatally flawed. One has to wonder about Altmaier‘s information supply.
Pattern of bullying throughout the science supply chain
Marginalizing dissenting views and intimidating uncooperative journalists and scientists is not only a practice that was recently used by the German Environment Ministry in the form of its UBA brochure, but it is also one that had been widely used by its main supplier for scientific information: Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research.
Two years ago a court in Cologne ordered Rahmstorf to cease and desist spreading “false assertions” about science journalist Irene Meichsner who earlier had written a highly critical article on IPCC science.
In a February 20, 2011 blog commentary, Rahmstorf wrote that the journalist’s story represented:
…a media scandal where a few journalists mislead the public with completely exaggerated or freely made up pseudo-scandals. Too many among them are naive and go along without seeing through the farce.”

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Background of that story here. Meichsner took Rahmstorf to court and won.
Thus bullying and intimidation of critics seems to have become a pattern throughout the entire science information supply chain of the German Environment Ministry.
Ministry may have committed a number of violations
What are the chances of success for the journalists against the Ministry of Environment in a court of law?
First off, the Ministry of Environment may have violated its rules for neutrality. Legal professor Thorsten Koch of the University of Osnabrück recently wrote that he believes the “Federal Environment Agency violated the rules of neutrality”. Koch explains that the government is allowed to participate and take a position on the climate issue, but adds:
Strange however that a government office is attempting to bindingly specify the state of knowledge in a scientific question. That is the job of a scientist. Even more it is neither scientifically or legally appropriate if scientific truths – and thus ultimately only the current state of the error – are announced with official authority.
Deciding scientific controversies is no duty of the state. The attempt we have here by the Environment Agency to decide a scientific controversy is in this form unique.”

And there’s “official state defamation”. Koch wrote:
The pamphlet is a product of official state action in which in one sense the claims that contradict the ‘scientific consensus’ made by ‘climate change skeptics’ (p. 110) are polemicized. Even the ZDF public television website ‘heute.de’ diagnosed it as ‘official state defamation’. This makes the matter legally questionable.”
It’s very difficult to predict the outcome of any legal battle.
German Association Of Journalists demands apology
Finally the German Association of Journalists demands an apology from Minister Altmaier, writing:
A state agency in Germany does not have the authority to brand critics of government policy as heretics and that Peter Altmaier “stop the distribution of the brochure in its current form and to apologise to the journalists named in the pamphlet.”
The pressure is mounting.

EPA Compromises the Integrity of Science 
Dear Colleague:
“Which do you find more shocking: that the Environmental Protection Agency conducts experiments on humans that its own risk assessment would deem potentially lethal, or that it hides the results of those experiments from Congress and the public because they debunk those very same assessments?” 
This critical question forms the basis for the attached Washington Times article: “Did Obama’s EPA relaunch Tuskegee experiments?” By Steve Milloy.
Moreover, this is one more piece of evidence that EPA uses science to play games, manipulate data, and generate faulty outcomes to justify their regulations. Here is a compelling example that highlights faulty science: “EPA researchers who conducted the experiments published the case study of the 58-year woman in the government journal Environmental Health Perspectives in which they casually disregard the woman’s preexisting conditions and blame her atrial fibrillation on PM2.2. They also failed to disclose the existence- let alone the results – of the other 40 experiments.”
If you are interested in understanding how the EPA continues to compromise the integrity of science, please read the full article here: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/apr/24/did-obamas-epa-relaunch-tuskegee-experiments/.
In Freedom,
/s/
Dana Rohrabacher
Member of Congress
=================================================================
I suppose next, the EPA will try to shut down the Volcanoes National Park because it is “too dangerous”.

"**The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK.**
Universities are opening temporary testing centres where hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave.
Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart.
If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December.
But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities.
The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"".
Caleb Shaw, a journalism student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, is taking a test on Monday.
""I know I'm less likely to get seriously ill with it,"" he says, but he wants to get a test to protect his family.
""If I get a test then I can make sure I don't bring it home to them. It would be stupid to not take advantage of it,"" Caleb says.
The university is using its sports centre as a temporary testing site until 6 December with 90 staff and students helping with the testing process.
Inshaal Ahmad, a students' union sabbatical officer at the University of Bradford, says most students seem supportive of the testing.
He says many students at Bradford live in multi-generational households, including older relatives, and want to ""be on the safe side"" and not risk bringing the virus back from university.
Testing at Bradford will continue until 6 December and as with other universities, booking slots for tests will also be a way of staggering the times when students can leave, within the ""travel window"" that ends on 9 December.
The mass testing is intended to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus as students travel away from their term-time addresses.
Sports halls and rooms on campus are being converted into testing centres, where students will take ""lateral flow"" swab tests, which will provide results within an hour, with the outcome sent by email or text.
Two tests are recommended to increase accuracy - and students will be expected to travel soon after a second negative result, with students in England and Wales encouraged to leave within 24 hours.
If students get a positive result, they will have to take another test to confirm - and if they have coronavirus they will have to stay and self-isolate.
Most universities are providing testing - 130 ""expressed an interest"" in taking part in the scheme, according to the Department for Health and Social Care.
But the National Union of Students says there should be capacity for all students who want a test to get one before Christmas.
""We are not aware of how universities will decide which students are tested if testing is oversubscribed,"" says the NUS.
The UCU lecturers' union says the approach to testing has been rushed and confused and the last-minute arrangements will be a ""recipe for chaos"".
The union said it had ""grave concerns"" and ""testing so many people and following necessary safety measures would be an extremely challenging operation"".
But not all universities in Northern Ireland are planning to offer testing.
""Testing will help to break the line of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it,"" said Professor Steve West, vice chancellor at the University of the West of England.
Bradford's vice chancellor, Professor Shirley Congdon, told students the tests ""offer extra assurance to you, your families, friends and community"".â¨"
"A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, particularly in central Queensland and the Hunter Valley, giving them a future as demand for carbon-intensive goods falls. That is the conclusion of a report by the Grattan Institute, a thinktank linked to the University of Melbourne, which examined claims Australia has the potential to become a green energy “superpower”.  Assessing the viability of clean manufacturing possibilities, the institute found green steel made with renewable hydrogen could become a multibillion-dollar export industry employing 25,000 people in regions likely to be hardest hit by global steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Tony Wood, the institute’s energy program director, said Australia had not typically been good at globally competitive manufacturing, succeeding instead at “digging stuff out of the ground”. But he said the rapid fall in the cost of solar and wind energy and the country’s world-leading clean energy resources was a “fundamentally significant change”. “We have the potential for competitive renewable energy to drive manufacturing in a way in which we wouldn’t have imagined not long ago,” Wood said. “If we get this right, we will resolve the great climate conundrum that has stretched our political fabric for more than a decade.” Options for diversifying Australia’s fossil fuel-intensive energy industries as the globe aims to cut emissions include exporting renewable energy, either as electricity by sub-sea cable or as hydrogen, and developing low-emissions commodities, such as metals, chemicals or biofuels. Rather than exporting renewable hydrogen, the analysis found the most economically viable path appeared to be to use it within Australia to produce steel with near-zero emissions. “Green steel” is created using hydrogen to trigger a chemical reaction with the oxygen in iron ore to create iron metal and water. The metal is then refined and cast into steel. Hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron ore is not yet commercial, but the report says it is based on a proven technology involving gas. Pilot plants are being built or planned in Germany and Sweden, where steelmaker SSAB recently has set a target of green steel production by 2026, a decade earlier than was previously considered possible. German manufacturer Thyssenkrupp made headlines in November when it demonstrated that a steel blast furnace could in part run on hydrogen. The institute’s report focuses on the future of “carbon workers” – people and communities in fossil fuel-reliant industries whose jobs will be threatened by global steps to tackle the climate crisis to meet the goals of the Paris agreement. There are nearly 100,000 carbon workers in Australia, 55,000 of them in “carbon-intensive regions” likely to face more acute social and economic challenges than people in major cities. More than 23,000 live in central Queensland, where they make up 15% of the workforce, mostly mining coal. Another 16,300 are in the Hunter Valley. The report says carbon-intensive electorates recorded bigger swings than average to the Coalition at the 2019 federal election, when it was emphasising it would do less to combat the climate crisis than Labor. While it may have helped it last year, it says the Morrison government’s approach of supporting only modest climate targets cannot protect jobs in the face of global climate action, and does not help the country seize new low-carbon opportunities. Wood and co-authors Guy Dundas and James Ha conclude this stance – stressing the short-term costs for those affected by climate policy while ignoring the cost of inaction – ultimately works against Australia’s national interest. It says both Coalition and Labor leaders have claimed Australia should and will continue to export fossil fuel products for decades while committed to the Paris agreement. In reality, the future for coal, gas, oil and products created with them was much less certain. “Australian governments need to be honest with carbon workers: their attempts to protect carbon jobs from global forces will ultimately fail,” the report says. “You don’t have to be a card-carrying climate activist to think this is a good idea. You just have to be someone making an assessment about risk,” Wood added. “Our practical plan could be a win-win-win. It would create a new export industry, support carbon workers and cut emissions.” The report is published as global institutions, industry groups, investors and civil society leaders call on governments to use stimulus programs needed to drive the economic recovery from Covid-19 to also address the climate crisis. Wood said a green steel industry would take time to develop, but unlike other options being considered was an area in which Australia had a competitive advantage. Currently, Australia mostly ships the raw iron ore and metallurgical coal used in steel production to Asian countries, where it is processed. But the institute found Australia was likely to have a cost advantage in manufacturing iron metal, and possibly refined steel, in a low-emissions world due to its access to cheap clean energy and the high cost of shipping hydrogen. Creating a green steel manufacturing industry at a global scale would demand big industrial workforces, such as those found in coalmining regions in central Queensland and New South Wales. The report says lower labour-costs meant it would be cheaper to make green steel in those places than in the Pilbara in Western Australia, even once shipping iron ore from the west to east coast was factored in. It says investment would need to come from the private sector, but calls on the federal government to fund a low-emissions steel “flagship” program to build local skills and capability over the next decade, possibly by using low-cost gas from WA to make steel with lower emissions as green steel developed, or by helping existing steel plants at Port Kembla and Whyalla modernise and survive. Other government support could include federal funding for studies into the geological potential for hydrogen storage and, at a state and local level, programs to help workers retrain. There has been optimism about the possibility of exporting hydrogen, but the report says its prospects are uncertain, in part because it is hard to transport. It must either be liquefied by cooling it to -253C or converted into a chemical such as ammonia. For exports to be viable, Australian hydrogen would need to be far cheaper than from other countries. The report says while an industry may develop, “the uncertainties mean that it is unlikely to be Australia’s most significant clean energy opportunity”. In terms of jobs, there were likely to be far more if Australia used its cheap clean energy to produce commodities for export than if it just sent renewable energy offshore. Manufacturing is far more labour-intensive than electricity generation, and its jobs generally better paid. The report says green steel is likely to cost more than fossil fuel steel for the foreseeable future, but if the cost of renewable hydrogen was to reach US$2 a kilogram it would add only 1% to the cost of a typical car or house, and 0.5% to a railway or road. It said there were also attractive, but probably smaller, opportunities in creating a sustainable biofuels industry and, to a lesser extent, development in renewable ammonia and exporting electricity via sub-sea cables, as proposed by the $20bn Sun Cable project backed by billionaires Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, which hopes to sell solar energy from the Northern Territory to Singapore. It said the federal government should consider requiring a share of domestic aviation fuel come from non-food biofuel sources, saying it could create hundreds of jobs in Collie, Portland and the Latrobe Valley. “These opportunities are not certain and will generally rely on either international policies to reduce emissions, or customers being willing to pay a ‘green premium,” the report says. “But these opportunities are credible, particularly if the world moves away from fossil fuels.” Partnering with competitors Tennant Reed, from the Australian Industry Group, said the report did a great job fleshing out the abstract idea of the advantages Australia may have in a clean energy world, and laying the foundations for future policy and development work. He said people had different views of where future opportunities would lie, with some excited by exporting bulk hydrogen, others aluminium, others steel, but the report illustrated how big the latter opportunity could be. He said the Grattan Institute envisaged a huge increase in Australia’s share of global steel production, a shift that would not be easy in a world in which countries may look to increase domestic manufacturing. It would require working closely with other nations. “It will be a lot harder if we are just trying to cut these countries and their companies out of the global steel industry rather than partnering with them,” Reed said. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, did not mention steel specifically when asked for his response to the report, but said clean commodities made with hydrogen would help the country become a world leader in that industry. He said the government had committed $370m to developing it through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the report showed the jobs and industry benefits of embracing a clean energy future, and accused the prime minister, Scott Morrison, of actively opposing going in that direction. “A Covid-19 recovery plan which brings forward investment in new renewable projects like green hydrogen will create tens of thousands of new jobs, stimulate regional economies and deliver cheaper power prices,” he said."

It’s time to give all mankind a real chance to enjoy genuine development
Guest post by Dr. Kelvin Kemm
The Rio+20 World Environmental Conference has come and gone. The “Plus 20” comes from the fact that it took place twenty years after the first such conference, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. Between these dates, I was a delegate at the 2002 world environment conference in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ever since 1992 I have watched the eco-evolution taking place.
There is a good side and a bad side. The good side is that general world environmental awareness has been enhanced. That is definitely good. But there is still so much to be done, especially in poor countries where many people are always on the edge of survival, people must eke out a living off the land, and many will do whatever it takes to earn a little cash, to just survive another day.

Here in South Africa we see the daily international poaching attacks on our elephants and rhinos. It’s disgraceful. For us in the south, on midwinter’s day in June (our winters are the opposite of those in the Northern Hemisphere), the total rhinos shot this year stands at 251, just to get their horns, which are still viewed as aphrodisiacs and medicine in many Asian countries. Last year’s total was 448, more than one a day – so it’s getting worse. Poachers are now using helicopters and machine guns, and often taking chainsaws to still living rhinos.
There is much to do to sustain and protect the world’s natural environment. That should be done – but done well, and honestly. The bad side of Rio+20 is the degree of scientific dishonesty and economic manipulation that has crept into the international debate. That is shocking.
In recent years we have heard a great deal about “climate change.” I am on record as saying I do not believe human activities that produce carbon dioxide (CO2) are making any significant contribution to climate change – certainly not anything dangerous or catastrophic.
Observed climate change appears to be in line with past historic meteorological cycles – and likely linked to natural cosmic rays interacting with the magnetic fields of the earth and the sun’s interactive magnetic screening system.
But there are organisations in the world that want mankind to be at fault, so that there is someone to blame and attack, someone to tax and control, and someone to encourage to be “traditional” and “sustainable” – and consequently in a state of perpetual primitive poverty and disease … on the edge of survival.
It was noticeable that Rio+20 moved away from the theme of “climate change.” It would appear that the disastrous climate change, which green extremists predicted with such great relish, has not been occurring. So climate change is dying as a “marketable concept.” They can’t use it to scare enough people anymore.
Thus the Rio+20 summit focused on the concepts of “biodiversity” and “sustainable development,” as the main themes, and therefore the main “worries.” If people can be made to worry, they can be made to fear, and then they can be controlled.
Rio+20 was all about international control. Certain green organisations clearly want to exert direct control over world governments, and want to impose their brand of world government on our planet, communities, businesses and families. The concepts of biodiversity and sustainable development give them the leverage.
The greens claim that our plant and animal species, our natural resources, our air and water, and our planet are in such desperate trouble that the extreme greens must take control. They will then defend “biodiversity,” and to do this they will decide what “sustainable development” actually means and how it must be implemented.
They will decide how, when and where any community will be permitted to “develop.” It is interesting to take another look at the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, which came out of the 2002 world environment conference in Johannesburg. It included language asking that the world pay attention to “the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people, which include: chronic hunger; malnutrition … and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.”
What happened to all these human issues at Rio+20? They were gone. For some reason, the Rio version of “biodiversity” and “sustainability” did not include humans.
In Rio the head of the WWF stated that the WWF wanted “transparent annual reporting and review on subsidy reforms, leading to the elimination by 2020 of all environmentally harmful subsidies, in particular fossil fuel subsidies.” Who do these people think they are? And why have they said nothing at all about the nearly $1 trillion that Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports has been spent worldwide just since 2004 on wind, solar, biofuel and other “renewable” energy schemes that any objective observer would understand are simply not “sustainable” on economic, environmental or any other grounds.
Moreover, this WWF statement is intended to give authenticity to some “world government,” to tell sovereign nations how to care for their own citizens.
In many African countries building a coal-fired power station will reduce CO2 emissions. How? Because there are millions of families who have no electricity, and so cook on wood or dung fires. These fires burn inefficiently and produce not just carbon dioxide, but many airborne pollutants that harm or even kill people. If thousands of these fires are replaced by a modern coal-fired power plant, the net effect would be to lead to improved air quality and less CO2 per unit of energy.
Such an action would be a significant advance, even if the CO2 actually were a problem, though much scientific evidence shows that it is not. This evidence of course is shouted down by those with vested interests in perpetuating “dangerous manmade climate change” as a thesis, and as a professional sinecure. Such an approach is not honest, and it is not science.
Meanwhile, however, European countries have introduced a carbon emissions tax on passenger aircraft flying over their airspace. The tax, per passenger, is calculated on total miles flown, so passengers flying to Europe from faraway places like South Africa and Australia pay much higher emissions taxes to the Europeans to clean up Euro air than do the EU’s own citizens, who collectively fly far more cumulative miles around Europe. Despite appeals from South Africa to spare us the tax, we were turned down. We are getting sick and tired of this high handed First World attitude.
Now from Rio+20 we are told that a goal for development is to move away from “outdated” concepts like measuring national growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – and to rather use more “modern” and “equitable” measures like the “Happy Planet Index” (HPI), under which some world authority or bureaucrat is going to place an “environmental value” on keeping our environment “pristine” and “traditional.” Those values will be built into the HPI. Meantime, many people in Africa will continue to cut down habitats to burn wood and dung, and we will fight elephant and rhino poachers all by ourselves.
In Rio, eight of the world’s largest development banks announced the largest monetary commitment to come out of Rio+20, a US$175 billion initiative to shift investment away from roads to public transport. They want to use the money to promote the use of buses, trains and bicycles, instead of cars and aeroplanes.
In many parts of Africa they don’t even have a road yet. No electricity either, nor school nor clinic.
It is time for UN, EU, US and other green do-gooders to get off their anti-development high horse. It’s time to give all of mankind a real chance to enjoy genuine development. It’s time to stop using a “preserving biodiversity” ruse to keep the world’s most impoverished people forever in poverty.

You really do have to wonder with this government if the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. They axed our lucrative oil and gas industries, citing the fact that they want to concentrate entirely on renewable energy sources. New Zealand is already a great place for this, with the majority of our electric power coming from hydro sources. The government is also pushing hard for people to take up driving electric vehicles, introducing plans to make the government fleet consist entirely of EVs, and proposing significant discounts for the purchase of EVs, compared to gas-guzzling petrol and diesel vehicles. 



Then yesterday, David Parker axed a planned hydro scheme in Waitaha, in Westland.



The Government has declined a hydro-scheme that would have tamed a ferocious stretch of water known as the “Mt Cook of rivers”.



The $100 million scheme would have generated enough electricity to power about 12,000 households.



Westpower, a 100 per Cent community-owned company, had applied for a Department of Conservation (DOC) concession for the scheme on the Waitaha River in Westland, one of the country’s most spectacular and untamed landscapes. 



**The final decision rested with Minister for the Environment David Parker, who declined the application despite DOC granting approval in principle.**



Westpower chairman Mike Newcombe said the decision has “shattered West Coasters’ ambitions for the sake of environment interests”. 



The Mokihinui Dam was the same story. It would have been situated in a pristine river where nobody ever goes, except a few kayakers. The kayakers won the day, and in 2012, the plan was cancelled. Now, the same thing has happened again.



“We are utterly stunned by this decision. West Coast interests and long-term benefits have been swept aside,” Newcombe said.



He questioned the Government’s commitment to regional economic growth and addressing the significant threats from climate change through renewable energy projects.



Yes. It would have been a good project to commit some of Shane’s $3 billion that he can’t seem to spend, along with providing a new source of renewable energy in a place that needs the investment. But no.



“It certainly seems so when a great opportunity to create a renewable energy project and enduring benefit for the community and broader region – developed through more than a decade of planning and consultation – has been knocked back in capitulation to minority interests intent on locking up the West Coast forever to the detriment of the local community.” 



He said the proposal was for a “run of the river” hydro scheme that would have offered West Coasters increased energy supply, reliability, self-sufficiency and ultimately resilience in the event of a natural disaster.



It would have provided jobs and increased business confidence as a result of a more reliable and cost-effective energy supply, he said.



“We put up a proposal that ticks all the boxes: renewable, sustainable energy, long-term regional economic development boost, careful environmental stewardship – and yet it was declined. It is an alarming decision not just for the Coast but for regional New Zealand.” 



And David Parker is heralded as a champion of New Zealand business? Don’t make me laugh.



Environment Minister David Parker said the application was declined because establishing the power scheme in this location would have significant impacts on the natural character of the area, the intrinsic value of the area and people’s enjoyment of it. 



Yep. Same as Mokihinui. About 3 people go there every year, and only in the summer.



 **He said by law he was not allowed to take economic impact on the Coast into consideration.**



 **Which just shows how badly this law needs to be repealed.** He is ONLY allowed to take into consideration the environmental impact, so the project never would have gone ahead, come hell or high water (pun intended). Exactly why he allowed everyone to waste so much time and money when the outcome was a foregone conclusion is a total mystery.



West Coast Labour MP Damien O’Connor said he was “disappointed from a local perspective” and Westpower were proven to be responsible environment managers. 



It is your government, Damien. Putting the interests of a few kayakers ahead of jobs and prosperity for your own voters is a risky strategy.



Westland mayor Bruce Smith said he was “gutted” with the decision.



“I am completely in disbelief. I read the reports the Minister relied on and can’t see anything useful in making the decision. I look at it from Westpower’s point of view which is owned by the West Coast community. They spent $2m and 10 years on this thing that would have made us self-sufficient in electricity. If we want economic growth we need to be self-sufficient,” he said.



“It’s not good for the West Coast economy. It’s just another move by this Government to lock up the West Coast as a playground for others.”



 **Fewer than a dozen people have successfully paddled the Morgan Gorge, the most challenging part of the river, and no-one has traversed its entire length.**



  
So as the demand for power increases exponentially, as a result of a growing population and increased power usage for things like electric cars, what will we do?



We will end up using coal-fired power stations. That’s what we will do.



Smart move for the environment and the country’s emissions, David Parker. Another senior minister joins the ranks of the idiotic and incompetent in this government. The list is growing very long indeed.

Temperature predictions from some climate models assuming the SRES A2 emissions scenario. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Guest post by Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
Abstract
Global CO2 emissions per unit increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration provide an independent constraint on climate sensitivity over the timescale of the available data (1960-2008), suggesting that, in the short term and perhaps also in the long, climate sensitivity may lie below the values found in the general-circulation models relied upon by the IPCC.
Introduction
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001, p. 358, Table 6.2), citing Myhre et al. (1998), takes the CO2 forcing ΔF as 5.35 times the logarithm of a proportionate change Cb/Ca in CO2 concentration, where Cais the unperturbed value. Warming ΔT is simply ΔF multiplied by some climate sensitivity parameter λ.
Projected 21st-century anthropogenic warming, as the mean of values on all six IPCC emissions scenarios, is 2.8 K (IPCC, 2007, table SPM.3: Annex, Table 0). Of this, 0.6 K is stated to be in the pipeline. Of the remaining 2.2 K, some 0.65 K is attributable to non-CO2 forcings, since the CO2 fraction of anthropogenic warming is 71% (the Annex explains the derivation). Thus the IPCC’s current implicit central estimate of the warming by 2100 that will be attributable solely to the CO2 we emit this century is only 1.56 K.
Projected CO2 concentration C2100 in 2100, the mean of the values on all six IPCC emissions scenarios, is 713 ppmv (Annex, Table 3), 345 ppmv above the 368 ppmv measured in 2000 (Conway & Tans, 2011). Therefore, the IPCC’s implicit climate-sensitivity parameter for the 21st century is 1.56 / [5.35 ln(713/368)], or 0.44 K W–1 m2. This value, adopted in (1), is half of the IPCC’s implicit equilibrium value 0.88 K W–1 m2 (derived in the Annex).

Global warming from 1960-2008
The IPCC’s implicit central estimate of CO2-driven warming from 1960-2008 is at (1):

The CO2 forcing coefficient 5.35 was given in Myhre et al. (1998). Initial and final CO2 concentrations were 316.9 and 385.6 ppmv respectively (Tans, 2012). Since the 0.46 K warming driven by the CO2 fraction is 71% of anthropogenic warming, use of the IPCC’s methods implies that, as a central estimate, all of the 0.66 K observed warming from 1960-2008 (taken as the linear trend on the data over the period in HadCRUt3, 2011) was anthropogenic. However, attribution between Man and nature remains problematic: an independent approach to constraining climate sensitivity produces a very different result.
An independent constraint on climate sensitivity
Since few non-linearities will obtrude at sub-centennial time-scales, to warm the Earth’s surface by 1 K the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere must increase by 345/1.56 = 223 ppmv K–1. From 1960-2008, the trend in the ratios of annual global CO2 emissions to annual increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations does not differ significantly from zero (Fig. 1). The mean emissions/concentration-growth ratio over the period was 15.5 Gt CO2 ppmv–1, which, multiplied by 223 ppmv K–1, gives 3450 GTe CO2 K–1, the quantum of CO2 emissions necessary to raise global temperature by 1 K.

Figure 1. Near-zero trend in annual emissions/concentration-growth ratios, 1960-2008. Data and methods are described in the Annex. Spikes caused by volcanic eruptions are visible. Excluding effects of major eruptions makes little difference to the outcome.
Total global CO2 emissions from 1960-2008 were 975 Gte CO2 (Boden et al., 2011). Accordingly, CO2-driven warming expected over the period, by the present method, was 975 divided by 3450, or 0.28 K. Allowing for the non-CO2 fraction, some 0.40 K warming over the period, equivalent to 61% of observed warming, was anthropogenic, not inconsistent with the estimate in IPCC, 2007 that at least 50% of observed warming from 1950-2005 was anthropogenic. However, inconsistently with (1), this method yields a CO2-driven warming that is only 61% of the central estimate derived from the IPCC’s general-circulation models.
Implications
On the assumption that the coefficient in the CO2 forcing function, cut from 6.3 to 5.35 in Myhre et al. (1998), is now correct, one implication of the present result is that the climate-sensitivity parameter λ appropriate to a 50-year period is not 0.44 K W–1 m2, as the models suggest, but as little as 0.27 K W–1 m2. Since the value of the instantaneous or Planck sensitivity parameter λ0 is 0.31 KW–1 m2 (IPCC, 2007, p. 631 fn.), temperature feedbacks operating during the period of study may have been somewhat net-negative, rather than appreciably net-positive as implied by (1).
If feedbacks operating over the short to medium term are indeed net-negative, there is no warming in the pipeline from past emissions; in the rest of this century CO2-driven warming may be little more than 1 K; anthropogenic warming from all sources may be less than 1.5 K; and supra-centennial-scale warming may also be significantly less than currently projected. If so, all attempts at mitigation will prove cost-ineffective, and the cost of adaptation to future warming will be well below current estimates.

Annex: supplementary material
Values of the climate sensitivity parameter λ
If net temperature feedbacks exceed zero, the climate sensitivity parameter λ is not constant: as longer- and longer-acting feedbacks begin to act, it will tend to increase between the time of a forcing to the time when equilibrium is restored to the climate 1000-3000 years after the forcing that perturbed it (Solomon et al., 2009). Illustrative values of λ are given below.
The sensitivity parameter derived from the present result and applicable to the 49 years 1960-2008 is 0.27 K W–1 m2.
Where temperature feedbacks sum to zero, the instantaneous value λ0 is 0.31 K W–1 m2 (derived from IPCC (2007, p. 631 fn.: see also Soden & Held, 2006).
Garnaut (2008) talks of keeping greenhouse-gas rises to 450 ppmv CO2-equivalent above the 280 ppmv prevalent in 1750, so as to hold 21st-century global warming since then to 2 K, implying λ262 = 2 / [5.35 ln{(280 + 450) / 280}] = 0.39 K W–1 m2. 
As explained in the text, the IPCC’s implicit climate-sensitivity parameter for the 21st century is λ100 = 1.56 / [5.35 ln(713/368)] = 0.44 K W–1 m2.
On each emissions scenario, the IPCC’s estimate of the bicentennial-scale transient-sensitivity parameter λ200 is 0.49 K W–1 m2 (derived in Table 0), a value supported by IPCC (2001, p. 354, citing Ramanathan, 1985).
The implicit value of the equilibrium-sensitivity parameter λequ is the warming currently predicted in response to a CO2 doubling, i.e. 3.26 K (IPCC, 2007, p. 798, Box 10.2), divided by the forcing of 5.35 ln 2 = 3.71 W m–2 at that doubling. Thus, λequ = 0.88 K W–1 m2.

"In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill’s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation. Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson’s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.  The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain’s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain’s future role in this changed world. Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson’s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground. Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a “watershed moment for humanity”, and a chance for “a world reset”. Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK’s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain’s strategic posture. The question of the UK’s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, “a flagship for dysfunction” can be set aside until the US elections. For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for “a deep dive” into the role of China, adding vaguely: “We cannot have business as usual.” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry. The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that the Huawei deal will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question. “We are all paying the price for Beijing’s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade – and put the rest of the world’s health at risk,” says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It’s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted “David Cameron’s Operation Kowtow” and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: “Just as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America’s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.” Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: “It is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi – setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage – is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.” In this context, British alliances with Japan and South Korea, rivals to China, will be at a premium. But a faultline on China is emerging in the Tory party. The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: “We can’t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can’t be dependent on China, but we can’t be without a framework of cooperation with China.” McDonald agrees: “There is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.” Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. “It is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered – through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.” But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. “We need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.” China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now delayed until the middle of next year, is to be a success. Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. “Build back better” has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages. But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has also been postponed, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation. Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain’s diplomats. He argues that: “Any tension that undermines the existing international architecture – whether it is WTO, WHO, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] – anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets. “You can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.” Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a no-deal Brexit on to a £300bn coronavirus hit to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable. Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. “If you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival – the survival of businesses and the economy – then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.” Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated. Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. “The budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,” Niblett says. In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between 13% and 34%. Covid’s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing. In this deglobalising world, Johnson’s promise in Greenwich to be “a superhero champion” of free trade looks incongruous. The US – with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal – is in free fall. Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important. At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened. The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system. In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests. Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials “will have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP”. There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK’s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus. Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently near the bottom of the class, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on “herd immunity” and then abandoning the policy. Niblett argues that “Brexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now. “On global health we will have taken a knock. Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo–US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.” Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be “brutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance”. He sees one cause of optimism. “This may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.” The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled “health is global”. The paper argued that health should be seen as “an agent for good in foreign policy” so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy. The UK may have been trounced in the election to head the WHO in 2017, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK’s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide. Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river “in the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London”. The nation’s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition."

"The surge of interest in British shale oil and gas has focused on central Scotland in recent days. A forward look at national planning to 2019 was published by the Scottish government on June 23. It has been followed by the release of a British Geological Survey (BGS) assessment of unconventional resources in place.   From the historical evidence, Scotland had good prospects in shale hydrocarbons. The region west of Edinburgh created the oil shale industry of James “Paraffin” Young, who mined organic shale from two-metre-thick seams. He refined a multitude of products from oils to soaps, which lit and cleaned his customers.  Along the way Young invented the first incarnation of the vertically integrated oil company, from resource to consumer, which still makes multinational profits today. Central Scotland also has a history of small-scale gas production, from coals and from isolated conventional sandstones.  So clearly a hydrocarbon system has been “worked” in the past. But even before the BGS report we knew from the geology that the 2km to 4km thicknesses of Bowland shale in England was not present, and the geographic area was smaller. Sure enough, the report indicates that we are not now heading for a new North Sea-style oil rush as predicted by some commentators for the “large and uninhabited and desolate areas” of the Bowland basin in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Northumberland.  Instead, Scotland looks more like a slow-burning fuse leading to a potentially useful, but less-than-spectacular outcome, like the Weald in Kent. Is exploitation of these Scottish shale oil and gas deposits worth the effort, and can it be achieved with minimal environmental and community impact? The estimate of resources in place by the BGS is smaller than that for Bowland –- 80.3 trillion cubic feet of gas (compared to 1300 trillion cubic feet in Bowland) and six billion barrels of oil (versus 4.3 billion in western Bowland). This Scottish shale oil is potentially the real prize, being at shallow geological depths and in restricted geographic areas.  As with all such estimates the potential recovery rate is unknown. It is typically taken to be 10% of the hydrocarbon present. For gas that means about 20 years’ supply for the entire Scottish requirement of current gas use -– or more realistically maybe 15% of Scottish supply for 100 to 140 years. It is also worth bearing in mind that the current reports are focused only on central Scotland. Potentially suitable geology exists in small or thin quantities around the offshore Clyde and Forth estuaries, the Moray Firth, Orkney, and the inner Hebrides - which could potentially supply gas for local use. The Scottish government has control of surface land use, environmental regulation, and planning – although ownership and exploration of deep hydrocarbons remains with Westminster. Not surprisingly given the different approaches to energy from the two jurisdictions, Scotland looks to be heading down its own route here. Rather than the “most favourable world regime” to encourage drilling and production promoted for England, the Scottish planning approach so far is more cautious. The Scottish government’s planning proposals have been influenced by experience with onshore wind developments. The proposals include negotiating on a case-by-case basis to leave “buffer zones” between a drilling site and the nearest human residents; specifically enforcing dialogue and consensus with local communities; robust risk assessments; and much more explicit protection for wild land, including a “green network” in central Scotland.   None of these hurdles are particularly tough or unusual. Any reputable developer used to shepherding onshore wind proposals through planning in Scotland would expect all of them. Yet it does seem to signal that Scotland is heading towards a more environmentally inclusive treatment of unconventional hydrocarbons than the aggressive push for speed delivered from Westminster.  How then would a considerate and wise developer attempt to proceed?  The first essential would be to gain the exploration rights, so we can expect to see some competitive interest over bidding for perceived hot spots in the forthcoming 14th onshore licensing round.  Then there is a need for real and specific information. In spite of its long history of coal mining, there is very little modern information in central Scotland from boreholes recovering rock core, or regional seismic reflection images deeper than 1km, so surveying and exploratory drilling is probable (and has taken place to a limited extent already).  Developers will have a mountain to climb in terms of providing information to the affected public – who in many cases have already been heavily conditioned by environmental interest groups and scary stories from parts of the USA with lax legislation.  While several boreholes in central Scotland have already been fracked, it’s clear that perceptions have changed. Much better surveying, information, and monitoring of existing baseline conditions will be required before any serious commercial operation gains consent.  Supposing that local public consent is achieved, is it “right” to extract and use shale hydrocarbons? A report in 2013 by the chief scientist of the UK department of energy and climate change made clear that there is no guarantee that unconventional hydrocarbons will reduce the UK’s carbon footprint, and indeed are likely to increase the world’s global carbon emissions.  And if “fugitive” leaks of methane occur from poorly engineered onshore drilling and production, the reported national emissions of Scotland could increase. That’s a difficult situation for a country seeking to deliver the world’s most ambitious carbon reductions. So carbon cleanup has to be an essential part of the deal.  There would seem to be three main options. First, the English model – drill and extract as fast as possible, using multinational corporations as the workforce, and hope that the lower-cost energy and taxes on production are a sufficient recompense.  Second is a conditional acceptance that extracting a fossil resource for a limited timespan could provide a one-off injection of wealth into a community, which could enable development of genuinely sustainable industries.  That might include considering that the chances of keeping a skilled petrochemicals industry with Ineos at the Grangemouth petrochemical plants and refinery complex would benefit from the security of lower-cost feedstock for the next decades (Ineos recently signed a deal to import fracked gas from the US from 2016-17).  Grangemouth’s petrochemicals plant produces two million tonnes of products annually, so if Scotland’s produceable shale oil were directed to Ineos, that is a 40-year life of low-cost feedstock. The price of feedstock is 50%-70% of bulk chemicals costs, so that would enable a globally competitive site to continue operations.  Using shale oil in industry could also solve an emissions problem, as fitting carbon capture onto these centralised larger industrial units makes Scottish unconventional oil production a low emissions proposition, secure against future climate legislation. By contrast, extracting shale gas to burn for heat and power looks like a low value proposition, with hard-to-control extra emissions. Or third, Scotland could choose to make a divestment statement and keep that fossil carbon in the ground. Option two provisionally looks most wise to me. Knowledge of, and confidence in, an assessment, drilling and extraction system can be developed slowly during five to 10 years of preparatory and test drilling investigation work, required before any production could get underway.  Not only does this potentially benefit the likes of Grangemouth, it also establishes a system for what comes after shale gas and oil – underground coal gasification – where very large Scottish resources are probable in the upper, mid and outer Forth, the Clyde and Canonbie. Drilling to convert those coals into gas deep below ground needs even more work to develop, but could provide domestic carbon resources into the medium future, potentially replacing the North Sea.  Being able to extract that much fossil hydrocarbon requires that environmental quality and carbon cleanup are essential, and are explicitly built in to any proposals. So if Scotland starts that now with shale oil, and keeps its renewable ambitions intact to develop home-grown secure low carbon electricity, the direction of travel could be about right. "
"**Two new mass testing programmes for Covid-19 are under way in a bid to drive down infection rates before Christmas.**
Testing of Scotland's university students is beginning in an effort to make sure they are safe to return home.
And residents in five coronavirus hotspots are being targeted as part of a trial mass testing programme.
They include communities in areas of Glasgow, Ayrshire, Clackmannanshire and Renfrewshire.
Experts say the community testing could cut the chain of transmission by identifying asymptomatic cases of coronavirus.
The tests are being carried out in parts of Scotland were public health officials consider the numbers are ""stubbornly high"".
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said they would help inform decisions about expanding community testing ""much more extensively"" in the New Year.
She added: ""It's important to stress that any test will only tell you if you are positive at that point in time, when you are being tested - they will not necessarily show up if you are still incubating the virus.
""So they do not mean you can or should stop following all the other safety measures in place.""
The testing of students is part of a separate programme designed to minimise the spread of Covid-19 as many of them prepare to return home for Christmas.
All students are being asked to take two rapid lateral flow device (LFD) tests before travelling.
The tests should be taken three days apart and if they are both negative they will be encouraged to go home as soon as possible.
If either test is positive, the student will be asked to self-isolate.
Positive cases should also take a more reliable PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test through NHS Test & Protect.
It is thought about 80,000 students could be planning a trip home during the winter break.
NUS Scotland president Matt Crilly said he ""strongly encouraged"" any student moving household over the holidays to get tested.
They are rapid turnaround tests, where samples are processed on-site with no lab required and results are available in under half an hour.
They have allowed the introduction of mass testing but they are not as accurate as the PCR tests that are carried at NHS test centres.
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told parliament this week the lateral flow tests had an overall sensitivity of 76.8% - meaning the test will identify more than seven in 10 positive cases of Covid.
Students are encourage to take two tests to increase the chances of the virus being picked up.
Ms Sturgeon said the tests ""produce results much more quickly"" and are ""potentially very useful"", but that any positive results would be confirmed via PCR testing.
The LFD tests being given to students have been criticised by Allyson Pollock, Professor of Public Health at Newcastle University.
Prof Pollock told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme they can result in 50% of cases being missed, leading to a ""false reassurance"".
""The other big issue for students is they're not being given good information about the purpose of test, what a test means and the fact it could result in a false reassurance and a false negative.""
Prof Pollock said that students should be self-isolating if they were returning to households with vulnerable people.
But Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said lateral flow testing could detect four out of five positive cases, despite the test's sensitivity level being between 50% and 70%.
""There is an element of false reassurance... but this is the tech we have available. So until the tech gets better, surely we should use the tech as good as we've got for the best purpose it has?""
He told BBC Scotland that students were not being told to isolate for two weeks when they got home ""as that wouldn't be much of a Christmas"".
""[The guidance] does tell them to turn down their social interaction now in order to be safe when they go home to their parents, their grandparents, their siblings,"" he added.
""Testing is not the umbrella around which we've based our student guidance, quite the opposite. The student guidance is all about communication, empathy, working with the student population - and element of that will be testing.""
Universities minister Richard Lochhead said all 19 higher education institutions in Scotland were taking part in the testing programme, with some sharing facilities.
He said the aim was to minimise the risk of students taking the virus back home to their families.
Mr Lochhead said there was a good probability the virus would be captured by the test but other safety measures such as limiting mixing with other students were also very important.
St Andrews opened its testing centre over the weekend.
Alastair Merrill, the university's vice-principal, said it would be able to process 1,500 lateral flow tests a day.
He said: ""We are keeping the centre open until the end of semester so as many students as possible have the opportunity to get their two tests before travelling home for Christmas.""
Mr Merrill said there had been a ""spike"" in Covid case at the start of term in September, particularly among first-year students.
He said there had been 100 cases in total, most in private student accommodation.
""We have been very successful in containing the spread,"" he said. ""There has been no evidence of spread in classrooms or education settings.""
He also said there was no evidence of any transmission from students to the wider community.
Mr Merrill said he thought that a similar approach to mass testing would be an important part of bringing students back to the university after the Christmas break."

A few weeks ago I wrote a piece highlighting a comment made in the Hansen et al. paper, “Earth’s Energy Imbalance and Implications“, by James Hansen et al. (hereinafter H2011). Some folks said I should take a real look at Hansen’s paper, so I have done so twice, first a quick look at “Losing Your Imbalance“, and now this study. The claims and conclusions of the H2011 study are based mainly on the ocean heat content (OHC), as measured in large part by the data from the Argo floats, so I thought I should look at that data. The Argo temperature and salinity measurements form a great dataset that gives us much valuable information about the ocean. The H2011 paper utilizes the recent results from “How well can we derive Global Ocean Indicators from Argo data?“, by K. von Schuckmann and P.-Y. Le Traon. (SLT2011)
Figure 1. Argo float. Complete float is about 2 metres (6′) tall. SOURCE: Wikipedia
The Argo floats are diving floats that operate on their own. Each float measures one complete vertical temperature profile every ten days. The vertical profile goes down to either to 1,000 or 2,000 metres depth. It reports each dive’s results by satellite before the next dive.
Unfortunately, as used in H2011, the Argo data suffers from some problems. The time span of the dataset is very short. The changes are quite small. The accuracy is overestimated.  Finally, and most importantly, the investigators are using the wrong method to analyze the Argo data.

First, the length of the dataset. The SLT2011 data used by Hansen is only 72 months long. This limits the conclusions we can draw from the data. H2011 gets around that by only showing a six-year moving average of not only this data, but all the data he used. I really don’t like it when raw data is not shown, only smoothed data as Hansen has done.
Second, the differences are quite small. Here is the record as shown in SLT2011. They show the data as annual changes in upper ocean heat content (OHC) in units of joules.  I have converted OHC change (Joules/m2) to units of degrees Celsius change for the water they are measuring, which is a metre-square column of water 1,490 metres deep. As you can see, SLT2011 is discussing very small temperature variations. The same is true of the H2011 paper.
Figure 2. Upper ocean temperatures from Schuckmann & Le Traon, 2011 (SLT2011). Grey bars show one sigma errors of the data. Red line is a 17-point Gaussian average. Vertical red line shows the error of the Gaussian average at the boundary of the dataset (95% CI). Data digitized from SLT2011, Figure 5 b), available as a comma-separated text file here.
There are a few things of note in the dataset. First, we’re dealing with minuscule temperature changes. The length of the gray bars shows that SLT2011 claims that we can measure the temperature of the upper kilometer and a half of the ocean with an error (presumably one sigma) of only ± eight thousandths of a degree … 
Now, I hate to argue from incredulity, and I will give ample statistical reasons further down, but frankly, Scarlett … eight thousandths of a degree error in the measurement of the monthly average temperature of the top mile of water of almost the entire ocean? Really? They believe they can measure the ocean temperature to that kind of precision, much less accuracy?
I find that very difficult to believe. I understand the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem and how that gives us extra leverage, but I find the idea that we can measure the temperature of four hundred million cubic kilometres of ocean water to a precision of ± eight thousandths of a degree to be … well, let me call it unsubstantiated. Others who have practical experience in measuring the temperatures of liquids to less than a hundredth of a degree, feel free to chime in, but to me that seems like a bridge way too far. Yes, there are some 2,500 Argo floats out there, and on a map the ocean looks pretty densely sampled. Figure 3 shows where the Argo floats were in 2011.
Figure 3. Locations of Argo floats, 2011. SOURCE
But that’s just a chart. The world is unimaginably huge. In the real ocean, down to a kilometer and a half of depth, that’s one Argo thermometer for each 165,000 cubic kilometers of water … I’m not sure how to give an idea of just how big that is. Let’s try it this way. Lake Superior is the largest lake in the Americas, visible even on the world map above. How accurately could you measure the average monthly temperature of the entire volume of Lake Superior with one Argo float? Sure, you can let it bob up and down, and drift around the lake, it will take three vertical profiles a month. But even then, every measurement it will only cover a tiny part of the entire lake.
But it’s worse for Argo. Each of the Argo floats, each dot in Figure 3, is representing a volume as large as 13 Lake Superiors … with one lonely Argo thermometer …
Or we could look at it another way. There were about 2,500 Argo floats in operation over the period covered by SLT2011. The area of the ocean is about 360 million square km. So each Argo float represents an area of about 140,000 square kilometres, which is a square about 380 km (240 mi) on each side. One Argo float for all of that. Ten days for each dive cycle, wherein the float goes down to about 1000 metres and stays there for nine days. Then it either rises from there, or it descends to about 2,000 metres, then rises to the surface at about 10 cm (4″) per second over about six hours profiling the temperature and salinity as it rises. So we get three vertical temperature profiles from 0-1,000 or 0-1,500 or 0-2,000 metres each month depending on the particular float, to cover an area of 140,000 square kilometres … I’m sorry, but three vertical temperature profiles per month to cover an area of 60,000 square miles and a mile deep doesn’t scream “thousandths of a degree temperature accuracy” to me.
Here’s a third way to look at the size of the measurement challenge. For those who have been out of sight of land in a small boat, you know how big the ocean looks from the deck? Suppose the deck of the boat is a metre (3′) above the water, and you stand up on deck and look around. Nothing but ocean stretching all the way to the horizon, a vast immensity of water on all sides. How many thermometer readings would it take to get the monthly average temperature of just the ocean you can see, to the depth of one mile? I would say … more than one.
Now, consider that each Argo float has to cover an area that is more than 2,000 times the area of the ocean you can see from your perch standing there on deck … and the float is making three dives per month … how well do the measurements encompass and represent the reality?
There is another difficulty. Figure 2 shows that most of the change over the period occurred in a single year, from about mid 2007 to mid 2008. The change in forcing required to change the temperature of a kilometre and a half of water that much is about 2 W/m2 for that year-long period. The “imbalance”, to use Hansen’s term, is even worse when we look at the amount of energy required to warm the upper ocean from May 2007 to August 2008. That requires a global “imbalance” of about 2.7 W/m2 over that period.
Now, if that were my dataset, the first thing I’d be looking at is what changed in mid 2007. Why did the global “imbalance” suddenly jump to 2.7 W/m2? And more to the point, why did the upper ocean warm, but not the surface temperature?
I don’t have any answers to those questions, my first guess would be “clouds” … but before I used that dataset, I’d want to go down that road to find out why the big jump in 2007. What changed, and why? If our interest is in global “imbalance”, there’s an imbalance to study.
(In passing, let me note that there is an incorrect simplifying assumption to eliminate ocean heat content in order to arrive at the canonical climate equation. That canonical equation is
Change In Temperature = Sensitivity times Change In Forcing
The error is to assume that the change in oceanic heat content (OHC) is a linear function of surface temperature change ∆T. It is not, as the Argo data confirms … I discussed this error in a previous post, “The Cold Equations“.  But I digress …)
The SLT2011 Argo record also has an oddity shared by some other temperature records. The swing in the whole time period is about a hundredth of a degree. The largest one-year jump in the data is about a hundredth of a degree. The largest one-month jump in the data is about a hundredth of a degree. When short and long time spans show the same swings, it’s hard to say a whole lot about the data. It makes the data very difficult to interpret. For example, the imbalance necessary to give the largest one-month change in OHC is about 24 W/m2. Before moving forwards, changes in OHC like that would be worth looking at to see a) if they’re real and b) if so, what changed, before moving forwards …
In any case, that was my second issue, the tiny size of the temperature differences being measured.
Next, coverage. The Argo analysis of SLT2011 only uses data down to 1,500 metres depth. They say that the Argo coverage below that depth is too sparse to be meaningful, although the situation is improving. In addition, the Argo analysis only covers from 60°N to 60°S, which leaves out the Arctic and Southern Oceans, again because of inadequate coverage. Next, it starts at 10 metres below the surface, so it misses the crucial surface layer which, although small in volume, undergoes large temperature variations. Finally, their analysis misses the continental shelves because it only considers areas where the ocean is deeper than one kilometre. Figure 4 shows how much of the ocean volume the Argo floats are actually measuring in SLT2011, about 31%
Figure 4. Amount of the world’s oceans measured by the Argo float system as used in SLT2011.
In addition to the amount measured by Argo floats, Figure 4 shows that there are a number of other oceanic volumes. H2011 includes figures for some of these, including the Southern Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Abyssal waters. Hansen points out that the source he used (Purkey and Johnson,   hereinafter PJ2010) says there is no temperature change in the waters between 2 and 4 km depth. This is most of the water shown on the right side of Figure 4. It is not clear how the bottom waters are warming without the middle waters warming. I can’t think of how that might happen … but that’s what PJ2010 says, that the blue area on the right, representing half the oceanic volume, is not changing temperature at all.
Neither H2011 nor SLT2011 offer an analysis of the effect of omitting the continental shelves, or the thin surface layer. In that regard, it is worth noting that a ten-metre thin surface layer like that shown in Figure 4 can change by a full degree in temperature without much problem … and if it does so, that would be about the same change in ocean heat content as the 0.01°C of warming of the entire volume measured by the Argo floats. So that surface layer is far too large a factor to be simply omitted from the analysis.
There is another problem with the  figures H2011 use for the change in heat content of the abyssal waters (below 4 km). The cited study, PJ2010, says:
Excepting the Arctic Ocean and Nordic seas, the rate of abyssal (below 4000 m) global ocean heat content change in the 1990s and 2000s is equivalent to a heat flux of 0.027 (±0.009) W m−2 applied over the entire surface of the earth. SOURCE: PJ2010
That works out to a claimed warming rate of the abyssal ocean of 0.0007°C per year, with a claimed 95% confidence interval of ± 0.0002°C/yr.  … I’m sorry, but I don’t buy it. I do not accept that we know the rate of the annual temperature rise of the abyssal waters to the nearest two ten-thousandths of a degree per year, no matter what PJ2010 might claim. The surface waters are sampled regularly by thousands of Argo floats. The abyssal waters see the odd transect or two per decade. I don’t think our measurements are sufficient.
One problem here, as with much of climate science, is that the only uncertainty that is considered is the strict mathematical uncertainty associated with the numbers themselves, dissociated from the real world. There is an associated uncertainty that is sometimes not considered. This is the uncertainty of how much your measurement actually represents the entire volume or area being measured.
The underlying problem is that temperature is an “intensive” quality, whereas something like mass is an “extensive” quality. Measuring these two kinds of things,  intensive and extensive variables, is very, very different. An extensive quality is a quality that changes with the amount (the “extent”) of whatever is being measured. The mass of two glasses of water at 40° temperature is twice the mass of one glass of water at 40° temperature. To get the total mass, we just add the two masses together.
But do we add the two 40° temperatures together to get a total temperature of 80°? Nope, it doesn’t work that way, because temperature is an intensive quality. It doesn’t change based on the amount of stuff we are measuring.
Extensive qualities are generally easy to measure. If we have a large bathtub full of water, we can easily determine its mass. Put it on a scale, take one single measurement, you’re done. One measurement is all that is needed.
But the average temperature of the water is much harder to determine. It requires simultaneous measurement of the water temperature in as many places as are required. The number of thermometers required depends on the accuracy you need and the amount of variation in the water temperature. If there are warm spots or cold parts of the water in the tub, you’ll need a lot of thermometers to get an average that is accurate to say a tenth of a degree.
Now recall that instead of a bathtub with lots of thermometers, for the Argo data we have a chunk of ocean that’s 380 km (240 miles) on a side with a single Argo float taking its temperature. We’re measuring down a kilometre and a half (about a mile), and we get three vertical temperature profiles a month … how well do those three vertical temperature profiles characterize the actual temperature of sixty thousand square miles of ocean? (140,000 sq. km.)
Then consider further that the abyssal waters have far, far fewer thermometers way down there … and yet they claim even greater accuracies than the Argo data.
Please be clear that my argument is not about the ability of large numbers of measurements to improve the mathematical precision of the result. We have about 7,500 Argo vertical profiles per month. With the ocean surface divided into 864 gridboxes, if the standard deviation (SD) of the depth-integrated gridbox measurements is about 0.24°C, this is enough to give us mathematical precision of the order of magnitude that they have stated.  The question is whether the SD of the gridboxes is that small, and if so, how they got that small.
They discuss how they did their error analysis. I suspect that their problem lies in two areas. One is I see no error estimate for the removal of the “climatology”, the historical monthly average, from the data. The other problem involves the arcane method used to analyze the data by gridding the data both horizontally and vertically. I’ll deal with the climatology question first. Here is their description of their method:
2.2 Data processing method
An Argo climatology (ACLIM hereinafter, 2004–2009, von Schuckmann et al., 2009) is first interpolated on every profile position in order to fill gappy profiles at depth of each temperature and salinity profile. This procedure is necessary to calculate depth-integrated quantities. OHC [ocean heat content], OFC [ocean freshwater content] and SSL [steric (temperature related) sea level] are then calculated at every Argo profile position as described in von Schuckmann et al. (2009). Finally, anomalies of the physical properties at every profile position are calculated relative to ACLIM.
Terminology: a “temperature profile” is a string of measurements taken at increasing depths by an Argo float. A “profile position” is one of the preset pressure levels at which the Argo floats are set to take a sample.
This means that if there is missing data in a given profile, it is filled in using the “climatology”, or the long-term average of the data for that month and place. Now, this is going to introduce an error, not likely large, and one that they account for.
What I don’t find accounted for in their error calculation is any error estimate related to the final sentence in the paragraph above. That sentence describes the subtraction of the ACLIM climatology from the data. ACLIM is an “Argo climatology”, which is a month-by-month average of the average temperatures of each depth level.
SLT2011 refers this question to an earlier document by the same authors, SLT2009, which describes the creation of the ACLIM climatology. I find that there are over 150 levels in the ACLIM climatology, as described by the authors:
The configuration is defined by the grid and the set of a priori information such as the climatology, a priori variances and covariances which are necessary to compute the covariance matrices. The analyzed field is defined on a horizontal 1/2° Mercator isotropic grid and is limited from 77°S to 77°N. There are 152 vertical levels defined between the surface and 2000m depth … The vertical spacing is 5m from the surface down to 100m depth, 10m from 100m to 800m and 20m from 800m down to 2000m depth.
So they have divided the upper ocean into gridboxes, and each gridbox into layers, to give gridcells. How many gridcells? Well, 360 degrees longitude * 2 * 180 degrees latitude * 2 * 70% of the world is ocean * 152 layers  = 27,578,880 oceanic gridcells. Then they’ve calculated the month by month average temperature of each of those twenty-five million oceanic volumes … a neat trick. Clearly, they are interpolating like mad.
There are about 450,000 discrete ocean temperatures per month reported by the Argo floats. That means that each of their 25 million gridcells gets its temperature taken on average once every five years …
That is the “climatology” that they are subtracting from each “profile position” on each Argo dive. Obviously, given the short history of the Argo dataset, the coverage area of 60,000 sq. miles (140,000 sq. km.) per Argo float, and the small gridcell size, there are large uncertainties in the climatology.
So when they subtract a climatology from an actual measurement, the result contains not just the error in the measurement. It contains the error in the climatology as well. When we are doing subtraction, errors add “in quadrature”. This means the resultant error is the square root of the sum of the squares of the errors. It also means that the big error rules, particularly when one error is much larger than the other. The temperature measurement at the profile position has just the instrument error. For Argo, that’s ± 0.005°C. The climatology error? Who knows, when the volumes are only sampled once every five years? But it’s much more than the instrument error …
So that’s the main problem I see with their analysis. They’re doing it in a difficult-to-trace, arcane, and clunky way. Argo data, and temperature data in general, does not occur in some gridded world. Doing the things they do with the gridboxes and the layers introduces errors. Let me show you one example of why. Figure 5 shows the depth layers of 5 metres used in the upper shallower section of the climatology, along with the records from one Argo float temperature profile.
Figure 5. ACLIM climatology layers (5 metre). Red circles show the actual measurements from a single Argo temperature profile. Blue diamonds show the same information after averaging into layers. Photo Source
Several things can be seen here. First, there is no data for three of the climatology layers. A larger problem is that when we average into layers, in essence we assign that averaged value to the midpoint in the layer. The problem with this procedure arises because in the shallows, the Argo floats sample at slightly less than 10 metre intervals. So the upper measurements are just above the bottom edge of the layer. As a result when they are averaged into the layers, it is as though the temperature profile has been hoisted upwards by a couple of metres. This introduces a large bias into the results. In addition, the bias is depth-dependent, with the shallows hoisted upwards, but deeper sections moved downwards. The error is smallest below 100 metres, but gets large quite quickly after that because of the change in layer thickness to 10 metres.
CONCLUSIONS
Finally, we come to the question of the analysis method, and the meaning of the title of this post. The SLT2011 document goes on to say the following:
To estimate GOIs [global oceanic indexes] from the irregularly distributed profiles, the global ocean is divided into boxes of 5° latitude, 10° longitude and 3-month size. This provides a sufficient number of observations per box. To remove spurious data, measurements which depart from the mean at more than 3 times the standard deviation are excluded. The variance information to build this criterion is derived from ACLIM. This procedure excludes about 1 % of data from our analysis. Only data points which are located over bathymetry deeper than 1000 m depth are then kept. Boxes containing less than 10 measurements are considered as a measurement gap.
Now, I’m sorry, but that’s just a crazy method for analyzing this kind of data. They’ve taken the actual data. Then they’ve added “climatology” data where there were gaps, so everything was neat and tidy. Then they’ve subtracted the “climatology” from the whole thing, with an unknown error. Then the data is averaged into gridboxes of five by ten degrees, and into 150 levels below the surface, of varying thickness, and then those are averaged over a three-month period … that’s all un-necessary complexity. This is a problem that once again shows the isolation of the climate science community from the world of established methods.
This problem, of having vertical Argo temperature profiles at varying locations and wanting to estimate the temperature of the unseen remainder based on the profiles, is not novel or new at all. In fact, it is precisely the situation faced by every mining company with regards to their test drill hole results. Exactly as with Argo data, the mining companies have vertical profiles of the composition of the subsurface reality at variously spaced locations. Again just as with argo, from that information, the mining companies need to estimate the parts of the underground world that they cannot see.
But these are not AGW supporting climate scientists, for whom mistaken claims mean nothing. These are guys betting big bucks on the outcome of their analysis. I can assure you that they don’t futz around dividing the area up into rectangular boxes, and splitting the underground into 150 layers of varying thinknesses. They’d laugh at anyone who tried to estimate an ore body using such a klutzy method.
Instead, they use a mathematical method called “kriging“. Why do they use it? First, because it works.
Remember that the mining companies cannot afford mistakes. Kriging (and its variants) has been proven, time after time, to provide the best estimates of what cannot be measured under the surface.
Second, kriging provides actual error estimates, not the kind of “eight thousandths of a degree” nonsense promoted by the Argo analysts. The mining companies can’t delude themselves that they have more certainty than is warranted by the measurements. They need to know exactly what the risks are, not some overly optimistic calculation.
At the end of the day, I’d say throw out the existing analyses of the Argo data, along with all of the inflated claims of accuracy. Stop faffing about with gridboxes and layers, that’s high-school stuff. Get somebody who is an expert in kriging, and analyze the data properly. My guess is that a real analysis will show error intervals that render much of the estimates useless.
Anyhow, that’s my analysis of the Hansen Energy Imbalance paper. They claim an accuracy that I don’t think their hugely complex method can attain.
It’s a long post, likely inaccuracies and typos have crept in, be gentle …

"Fossil fuel industry groups and companies have applauded new climate change measures proposed by the Morrison government, including support for carbon capture and storage developments. The government has agreed to 21 of 26 recommendations made by an expert panel review headed by the former gas industry executive and business council president Grant King, who was asked to come up with new ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at low cost.  Recommendations included paying big industrial companies to keep their emissions below an agreed limit, and allowing the government’s main climate policy, the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, to support carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said the government agreed in-principle that two publicly owned clean energy agencies, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, would be given a “technology neutral remit” – a proposal that has been interpreted as allowing more funding for projects that do not involve renewable energy. The government’s response was welcomed by the gas and coal sectors, received qualified support from industry groups and was criticised by environmentalists, who said it directed emissions reduction funding to polluting companies and did not address Australia’s lack of an overarching climate policy. CCS, which involves capturing industrial carbon dioxide as it is released and injecting it underground, has been a contentious area of public policy in Australia, having been promised billions of dollars in public funding for little result. The first significant project in Australia, Chevron’s Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in the Pilbara, started operating last year after years of delay. Supporters say CCS can play a role in cutting emissions at industrial sites, if not power plants, and both the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have acknowledged it has a role to play. Opponents say it has failed to deliver on scale over two decades and takes funding away from cheaper clean technology. The plan to include CCS in the emissions reduction fund follows oil and gas giant Santos saying access to carbon credits or a similar revenue stream would be critical if it was to invest in a joint CCS project with BHP in South Australia. The Moomba CCS project, in SA’s remote north-east, is promised to capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year released during gas processing. Santos’s chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, applauded the government for supporting “sensible, job creating recommendations that will cut through red and green tape” to accelerate investment in “real” emissions reduction opportunities. “Just as private investment in renewable energy deployment was accelerated through public policy and funding over the last two decades, we now need to focus on accelerating CCS in similar ways,” Gallagher said. Andrew McConville, the head of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, representing oil and gas companies, said the review had proposed sensible steps on climate change. “Importantly, the report underlines the key role the oil and gas industry can play in cutting emissions,” he said. Tania Constable, the head of the Minerals Council of Australia, said it provided “a clear path” for cutting emissions while keeping the country’s “core industries” including mining and minerals processing competitive. Coal21, an organisation created to research low-emissions technology that used funding for pro-coal advertising, said the support for CCS was a “win for the environment and industry”. The King review’s recommendations include changing the “safeguard mechanism” – a policy that was promised to stop industrial emissions rising but that in practice has led to a significant increase – so that companies that emitted below a baseline would receive carbon credits they could sell. Speaking on ABC radio on Tuesday, Taylor said the proposal was not a form of voluntary carbon trading, then said that trading already happened and was “nothing new”. Richie Merzian, from thinktank the Australia Institute, said the changes backed by the government would increase fossil fuel industries’ access to a limited pool of funding for climate action, and criticised the lack of process behind the review. He said King’s four-person expert panel was commissioned in October without public visibility, run without public consultation, and its report was held back by the government until it was ready to also release its response. “Australians have a right to be frustrated by this, not just because of the support for fossil fuels, but by the appalling process,” Merzian said. “We should wake up to the fact that this is happening at a much larger scale with the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, which will involve the investment of hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars.” Suzanne Harter, a campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the emissions reduction fund was ineffective and the King review recommendations would make it weaker. “Australia has virtually no effective climate policy and no pathway to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” she said. The Australian Industry Group said the review included several useful steps to help reduce emissions, but would need to be backed by significant funding and a strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found global emissions need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050 to give the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Taylor said it was not the government’s policy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. He said the Coalition was committed to cutting emissions without imposing new costs on households. He has said the recommendations aligned with a soon-to-be-released “technology investment roadmap”, and would position Australia to beat the 2030 target it set at the Paris climate agreement. Analyses have previously found the government is not on track to meet the 2030 target, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, without using a carbon accounting loophole. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the opposition would take time to consider its response but criticised the Coalition’s policy for failing to cut emissions since 2014. Adam Bandt, the Greens leader, accused the government of engaging in “greenwashing”. “Minister Taylor’s huffing and puffing about CCS is the same failed fossil fuel industry pipe dream they have been promoting for years,” he said."

Guest post by Bob Tisdale
This post is a continuation of my post Tamino Once Again Misleads His Followers, which was cross posted at WattsUpWithThat here. There Tamino’s disciples and his other followers, one a post author at SkepticalScience, have generally been repeating their same tired arguments.
The debate is about my short-term, ARGO-era graph of NODC Ocean Heat Content (OHC) data versus the GISS climate model projection. This discussion is nothing new. It began in with Tamino’s unjustified May 9, 2011 post here about my simple graph. My May 13, 2011 reply to Tamino is here, and it was cross posted at WUWT on the same day here. Lucia Liljegren of The Blackboard added to the discussion here.
A graph that’s similar to the one Tamino and his disciples think is fake is shown in Figure 1. It’s similar but different, sort of a short-term OHC model-data comparison Modoki. We’ll get back to it.

Figure 1
First, let’s discuss…
…THE BLATANTLY OBVIOUS ERROR IN TAMINO’S RECENT FAILED CRITIQUE

Tamino’s recent failed critique is titled Fake Predictions for Fake Skeptics. Some people have noted that a fake climate skeptic would be an anthropogenic global warming proponent, but we’ll move on from the implications of that.
Tamino linked to the NODC Ocean Heat Content webpage as the source of his data. There, the NODC provides a spreadsheet of their global OHC data (here). Tamino presents a few preliminary graphs and observes:
Note that there’s a decided hot fluctuation in 2003. So we’ll “predict” the time span 2003 to the present, based on data from 1993 to 2003.
His next graph (my Figure 2) is identified only with the heading of “Ocean heat content 0-700m”. It includes a linear trend that Tamino claims is “based on data from 1993 to 2003”. The length of the trend line is assumedly based on the same period as data. But the period of his trend line does not include the “decided hot fluctuation in 2003.”

Figure 2 (Tamino’s 3rdgraph)
Tamino’s next graph, my Figure 3, includes an extension of his linear trend. In addition to the heading, the graph identifies the red trend line as “fit 1993-2003”, but his “fit 1993-2003” still does not include the “decided hot fluctuation in 2003.”

Figure 3 (Tamino’s 4rdgraph)
In the paragraph after that graph, Tamino states:
We can see that observations don’t follow the prediction exactly — of course! The main difference is that during 2003, the observations were hotter than the prediction. For that time span at least, the oceans had more heat than predicted.
He reinforces that the 2003 data is warmer, yet he and his disciples fail to observe that the 2003 data is not included in his “fit 1993-2003”.
The NODC clearly marks their quarterly data in the spreadsheet they provide here. The Global OHC value at 2002-12 is 6.368768 [*10^22 Joules], and the value at 2003-12 is clearly marked 11.6546 [*10^22 Joules]. But the data included in Tamino’s trend does not include the 4thquarter 2003 data at 11.6546 [*10^22 Joules].
If you’re having trouble seeing that, Figure 4 is similar to Tamino’s graph with the hash marks included. It shows the trend based on the period of 1993 to 2002.

Figure 4
And Figure 5 gives you an idea what Tamino’s graph would look like if he had actually included 2003 data in his trend.

Figure 5
Animation 1 compares the two. (You may need to click on it to get the animation to work.)

Animation 1
How could Tamino and his disciples have missed such an obvious mistake? Some of you might even think it wasn’t a mistake on Tamino’s part, and that his disciples purposely overlooked that blatant error. I’m sure you’ll have a few comments about that.
HANSEN ET AL (2005) OFFSETS THE OHC DATA
A recent comment noted that the observations-based dataset in Hansen et al (2005) was not NODC OHC data, that it was the OHC data based on Willis et al (2004). I never stated that I was providing Willis et al (2004) data. My OHC update posts have always been about the NODC dataset.
My Figure 6 is Figure 2 from Hansen et al (2005). Note that the data starts at about zero watt-years/m^2 in 1993. And my Figure 7 is Figure 3 from Willis et al (2004). Note that the Willis et al data starts at -1 * 10^8 Joules/m^2 at 1993. Hansen et al converted the data, which is not in question since I’ve done the same thing, and Hansen et al have offset the data, which I have done also.

Figure 6
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Figure 7
Mysteriously, Hansen et al can shift the data without comment from Tamino, but when I do it, it’s interpreted by Tamino and his disciples, and by those from SkepticalScience, as a fake graph.
THE BEST WAY TO COMPARE THE MODELS TO THE OBSERVATIONS-BASED OHC DATA
Obviously, the best way to present the GISS Model-ER projection for Ocean Heat Content would be to use the actual GISS Model-ER data. The RealClimate annual model-data updates here and herepresent the Model-ER data. But the Model-ER OHC simulations are not available in an easy-to-use format like at the KNMI Climate Explorer. If it was available, all of this nonsense about my shifting data, my misrepresenting data, etc., would disappear. Why?
I have stated in comments at WUWT that I would use the ensemble mean of the Model-ER data and the NODC OHC observations for my future model-data comparisons. I’ve also stated I would use the base years of 1955-2010 to avoid the possibility of being accused of cherry-picking the base years.
Why? I presented this in a June 14, 2011post. And that post has been linked to all OHC updates since then.
Figure 8 is a graph from a 2008 presentation by Gavin Schmidt of GISS. It includes the OHC simulations of the Model-ER for the period of 1955 to 2010, which is the model data shown in the RealClimate model-data posts. It also includes the older version of the global NODC OHC data.

Figure 8
If we:
1. replicate the ensemble mean data of the GISS Model-ER,
2. replace the older NODC OHC data with the current version, and
3. use the base years of 1955-2010 so that no one can complain about cherry-picked base years,
Figure 9 would be a reasonable facsimile of the long-term comparison from 1955 to 2010. Notice where the ensemble mean of the GISS Model-ER intersects with the data near the ARGO era. Sure looks like 2003 to me. Figure 1 at the top of this post confirms how closely the GISS Model-ER would intersect with the NODC OHC data at 2003.

Figure 9
That graph in Figure 1 looks familiar, doesn’t it? It sure does look like the ARGO-era graphthat Tamino and his disciples dislike so much.
MY OFFER
In my January 28, 2012 at 6:18 pmcomment at the WUWT cross post I wrote the following:
I offered in a comment above to use the base years of 1955-2011 for my short-term ARGO-era model-data comparison. That way there can be no claims that I’ve cherry picked the base years or shifted the data inappropriately. I do not have the capability to process the GISS Model-ER OHC hindcast and projection data from the CMIP3 archive. So I cannot create the ensemble member mean of the global data, on a monthly basis, for the period of 1955 to present. But some of you do have that capability. You could end the debate.
If you choose to do so, please make available online for all who wish to use it the Global GISS Model-ER hindcast/projection ensemble member data on a monthly basis from 1955 to present, or as far into the future as you decide.
I will revise my recent OHC update and reuse that model data for future OHC updates. That way we don’t have to go through this every time I use that ARGO-era comparison graph as the initial graph in my OHC updates.
Fair enough?
Any takers?
CLOSING
I know the trend of the OHC data is not the model mean, but for those who are wondering what Tamino’s NODC OHC graph might have looked like if he had actually included the 1993 through 2003 data in his trend AND then compared it to the period of 2003 to 2011, refer to Figure 10.

Figure 10
And if he had lopped off the data before 2003, because it isn’t presented in the graph that he complains about so much, the result would look like Figure 11.

"Ten years ago, when Australia’s climate and energy botch-up was still in its infancy, politicians and their advisers used to talk up the virtues of gas as a transitional fuel, and they used to talk about carbon capture and storage (CCS) as technology that governments needed to invest in to drive the transition to low-emissions economies. The great botch-up is now well past infancy, and Australia’s record on climate and energy is a disaster so profound it’s still traumatising backstage protagonists years after the stadium rock wreckers have left the crime scene.  Yet people in power are still talking within the same parameters. Gas. CCS. As if these might be new discoveries – as if the economics of the transition have remained immutable in the decade we spent watching the political class execute inter-generational failure at our expense. Just in case you’ve missed the Morrison government warming up the talking points about Australia’s great gas-led recovery from the economic shock of Covid-19, allow me to bring this winter marketing offensive to your attention. The prime minister, several ministers, and some prominent corporate advisers, like the former Fortescue boss Nev Power, are out, banging that drum. We are told cheap gas will help restart an economy hit for six by coronavirus. Cheap gas will boost flagging growth, create jobs, and make projects considered uneconomic five minutes ago suddenly economic. It is gas nirvana, as far as the eye can see – except it is unclear to me where this cheap gas will come from. Gas prices have fallen recently, but will these falls be sustained? Are falling gas prices really the environment in which companies will pursue new investments? Won’t they worry about stranded assets? Won’t they worry about carbon risk – that being a real thing. Ask the Reserve Bank. Or the banking regulator. Or the corporate regulator. Australia’s gas industry needs to be able to extract and sell the resource at a rate of return that justifies any new investments accompanying the opening up of new supply. That’s a basic rule of business, unless there’s some undisclosed fine print. Unless, of course, the real story is taxpayers are going to be saddled with the risks of marginal investments, which makes gas nirvana sound more like a billion-dollar boondoggle dreamed up by a kitchen cabinet of vested interests. But that doesn’t sound nearly as exciting, does it? Just while we are on this, gas nirvana also has another dimension. It is being invoked, in part, to justify the reworking the miserable suite of alleged emissions reduction policies that the Coalition has kept on life support since the Abbott era. If the future is gas and CCS, then the policies will need another tweak to make them fit for purpose, because low emissions are just a matter of definition. The government says we need to look at CCS because all the sensible people are technologically neutral, not ideological. The goal should be emissions reduction, never mind the means. Fine as far as it goes, except that parable lacks some context. The real story is this: Australia has failed to take meaningful action to reduce emissions, because the Coalition has wrecked progress at every turn for more than 10 years. The truth is the Liberal and National parties have blown the critical decade. That failure is now an implicit justification for more taxpayer support for CCS, because the need may become so pressing that all options will have to be on the table to try and stave off the worst-case scenario – not that the arguments will ever be framed in such frank terms. The talking point says this: Australia can sequester emissions, we can have our fossil fuel cake and eat it too. Cue applause track. I need to make a couple of things clear because the climate and energy debate has become so toxic and so polarised that all nuance has departed the stage. I have no profound objection to gas as a transitional fuel – the operative word being transitional. If we pursue gas peaking to firm renewables, that’s one thing. If we bolt gas into the system as a permanent substitute for coal, and justify that substitution on the basis that gas is marginally less emissions-intensive, that’s quite another. I also don’t object to CCS, because as I flagged a minute ago, we might actually need it. If Donald Trump somehow manages to convince Americans to re-elect him in November despite the fact the president represents a clear and present danger to his own citizens, we are going to need a whole lot more than CCS to get the world out of the climate hole it will fall into because of the sustained absence of US leadership. What I’m saying today is two things: resources are finite, and the government has options. Let’s call them option A and option B. Option A sees the Morrison government choose not to make a mockery of the international climate commitments it signed up to, voluntarily, in 2015. It can use the economic recovery from Covid-19 as an opportunity to drive a low-emissions transition, which will drive sustainable jobs and growth. The government can choose to set Australia up for half a century, not another election cycle. Plenty of smart people think that’s a viable option. Then there’s option B. The government can use the recovery from Covid-19 as cover to lock in fossil fuels for another couple of decades. It can dress up the gas-led recovery as an act of enlightened national sovereignty, a downpayment on enhancing strategic capability, knowing that concept will resonate at a time when Australians are feeling insecure about their economic prospects. Morrison and his ministers and advisers can gamble that a majority of Australians will care more about having a job today than saving the planet tomorrow – and the worst of it is, that’s not much of a gamble. This sensibility broadly reflects community sentiment. This is how a majority of Australians have voted at every federal election since 2013 – and that was before we all endured the greatest economic shock since the great depression – before a global pandemic rendered community-minded activism a second-order issue, a luxury that might be resumed in due course. To be clear: right now, on current indications, the Coalition is limbering up for option B, and trying to make a virtue of it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: GISS data confirm Jung’s results.
Note: the temperature data was evaluated by meteorologist Jung, and not the Austrian weather service, as was mistakenly reported. The result, however, remains unchanged. 
==============================
Perhaps you’ve been wondering why the alarmists have been so shrill lately? It’s not because the climate is overheating, to the contrary it’s beginning to cool – and so their sham is about to be blown out into the open for everyone to see.

Austrian meteorological data show that European Alps have been cooling, at times massively, over the last 20 years. Public domain photo.
Evaluated data from the Austrian ZAMG meteorological institute now unmistakably show that the Alps have been cooling over the last 20 years and longer, “at some places massively” thus crassly contradicting all the loud claims, projections, and model sceanrios made earlier by global warming scientists.
German meteorologist Dominik Jung reports on the data he himself evaluated from the European Alps and concludes at the German-language Huffington Post here:
We are obviously very far away from milder winters. The trend actually is moving in the opposite direction! A few years ago climatologists advised winter sports locations in the Alps to reduce their investments in winter sports facilities – because of the ever increasing mean temperatures, they soon would not be worth it. So we ask ourselves, which increasing temperatures are the ladies and gentlemen even talking about?”
Some places have seen “massive cooling”

According to an expert review conducted by Dominik Jung of data from the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the Austrian state weather service, using weather data going back 20 years, or more: “Winters there indeed are shown to have gotten colder over the last 20 years, and in some places quite massively. The last two winters at Kitzbühel were in fact the coldest of the last 20 years.”
Jung then writes that also four other high elevation stations in the Alps were assessed: Zugspitze in Germany, Schmittenhöhe in Austria, Sonnblick in Austria and Säntis in Switzerland. Result:
They all yielded the same amazing result: Winters in the Alps over the last decades have become significantly colder, the data show.”
Jung writes that data from extra long datasets from 20 to 30 years were examined, “just like climatologists always insist.”
Jung then informs readers that he asked the Austrian meteorological experts on site what they thought of the results. According to Jung, the reaction was either dead silence induced by shock, or attempts to downplay the results. Had the data shown warming instead, then of course we would be hearing just the opposite of silence and downplaying…we’d be hearing the hysterical screams of bloody climate murder!
Humiliated science
Jung speculates that the reason meteorologists and climatologists don’t want to hear about the results is because “it doesn’t fit with their world view.”  After all, just a few years ago they were cock-sure about their predictions of winters without snow and that skiing was only going to be possible at extremely high elevations. Science just possibly could not be humiliated to a greater extent.
Near the end of his Huffington Post essay, Jung comments that it appears that “climate warming has become a religion. Those belonging to it do not tolerate new findings“, even those that stem from solid observations and measurements.
Meteorologist Jung concludes that it’s almost scandalous that the responsible authorities are simply ignoring these findings.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."
"**Mass testing is set to be introduced in England's tier three ""high risk"" coronavirus areas, following a successful pilot in Liverpool.**
Universities have also begun mass testing students ahead of their return home for Christmas.
Mass testing means asking everyone to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms.
The idea is to find people who may be infected, but not yet displaying symptoms.
They can then be told to isolate and be prevented from spreading the virus.
Mass testing can be used in more targeted ways, including:
Currently, most people can only have a test if they already have symptoms.
But under England's new, stricter tier system, which applies after lockdown ends on 2 December, the government says mass testing will be widened out to the tier three areas, home to 23.3 million people.
It follows the success of the Liverpool pilot, with everyone living or working in the city offered a voluntary test.
More than 300,000 people have been tested since the pilot began, from a population of about half a million.
Cases there have fallen from 635 per 100,000 people in mid-October to 106 in the week to 26 November, helping Liverpool move from tier three to tier two.
In addition to testing the general population, local authorities in tier three areas could also target high-risk workplaces and hard-to-reach communities.
This could be similar to the Liverpool pilot, which has mobile testing sites in care homes and schools.
People might be invited to have a test, but they can also book their own online. Whole families can also just turn up in their car.
NHS staff will also be tested for coronavirus twice a week. Routine testing of health workers already happens in hardest hit areas.
Many universities have started mass testing students ahead of the Christmas break.
Students are being asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they test negative, they can leave university in the ""travel window"" starting on 3 December.
But testing is voluntary and not available in all universities.
The Liverpool pilot offers two types of testing, both involve swabbing the nose or throat.
The **PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test** is regarded as the ""gold standard"" by epidemiologists, but takes up to a day or longer to produce a result because the sample is sent off to a laboratory.
The **lateral flow test** involves a handheld kit that gives a result - a bit like a pregnancy test - in about 20 minutes. There's no need for a lab. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on one end, then a marking appears if you are positive.
Anyone who tests positive must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. Their contacts will be traced by NHS Test and Trace.
All other people in their household must also self-isolate for 14 days from the day the person first became ill, or from the day of the test, if they have no symptoms.
Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise.
People should order online groceries, or ask friends and family to get supplies and leave them outside the front door.
Anyone in England who fails to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to Â£10,000.
Anyone on low income who was instructed to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace should be able to claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority.
In September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined his ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring.
He said that ""in the near future"" he wanted to start using testing to let people who tested negative ""behave in a more normal way"".
Other countries have already introduced mass testing programmes."
"Restarting the economy and getting people back to work after the coronavirus lockdown should focus on low-carbon work programmes, the UK government’s climate advisers have urged. They said this would generate new jobs, protect the climate and ensure a fairer economy for everyone.  People’s homes could be made ready for winter and new jobs created through schemes to insulate houses, while tree-planting could begin and flood barriers be constructed, the Committee on Climate Change advised Boris Johnson. Fulfilling the UK’s need for low-carbon infrastructure, from electricity networks to cycle lanes, and restoring peatlands, would create jobs in the short term, while government money could also be used to encourage advances in science and innovation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future, the committee found. The UK has a target of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050, but before the coronavirus crisis the government had set out few plans to achieve it. In a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday, the committee said combining the recovery from the lockdown with actions to cut emissions would be beneficial in the short and long term. “Actions towards net-zero emissions and to limit the damages from climate change will help rebuild the UK with a stronger economy and increased resilience,” wrote the committee chair, Lord Deben, and the chair of the sub-committee on adaptation, Lady Brown. More measures were needed to help people continue to walk, cycle and work remotely after the lockdown eases, the committee said. Increased cycling and walking would reduce the strain on public transport while keeping down air pollution, which people have become more aware of because of reduced road traffic. The advisers also called for retraining programmes to equip people with skills such as installing low-carbon heating, energy and water efficiency, and flood protection for homes. They said rescue packages for carbon-intensive sectors “should be contingent on them taking real and lasting action on climate change”, to avoid locking in high emissions for the future. Fairness should be a “core principle” of any recovery, they advised. “The crisis has exacerbated existing inequalities and … the response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change,” the chairs wrote. “The benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay, or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes. It is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new resilient economy.” The committee’s advice bolsters calls from other experts to “green” the economic recovery. On Tuesday, a group of leading economists, including the Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, set out evidence that government spending on low-carbon and other environmentally beneficial activities would provide a bigger boost to the economy, in both the short and long term, than pursuing a traditional recovery that poured money into fossil fuels and ignored the climate crisis. Green campaigners urged the government to heed the advice. Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Improving people’s lives and saving the climate needs to be central to recovery, not rebuilding the profits of damaging industries. The right post-pandemic investment can push a big, positive, reset button on our carbon-guzzling and unsustainable economy and build a clean, healthy and fair world.” Richard George, head of oil for Greenpeace UK, said: “When you have both the economy and the environment on the same side of the scales, the debate is over. The only question now is whether the government will listen to the experts and support a recovery package that protects our jobs, our health and our climate.” Chris Venables, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said the coronavirus crisis was changing the public’s understanding of what is possible in terms of combating climate change, and changing people’s expectations of the government’s role in improving society. “The recovery can change the way we think about public health and the health of the planet, whether that is preferring online connectivity to carbon-intensive travel, or making greater efforts to conserve forests and improve access to green spaces. In response to coronavirus, the government has taken decisive measures. Similar courage can lead us to a healthier world in recovery.” In the letter, the committee reminded the prime minister of Britain’s role on the world stage. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for November but now postponed to next year. Johnson and the Cop26 president, the business secretary Alok Sharma, will be urging other countries to come forward with national plans to curb carbon. Deben and Brown said the UK must show leadership by linking the economic recovery and the climate crisis.“Our credibility as an international leader rests on taking action at home,” they said."

Phil Quin’s opinion piece in _Stuff_ should have a written warning to alert the reader to the verbal vomitus hazard. Stand back reader! Avoid Phil’s regurgitated stinky stuff all over your shoes. Feeling better now, Phil?



“ ** _Why is it so hard_** for us to say out loud the blazingly obvious about the president of the United States: **_that he has utterly lost his mind_**.”



  
There’s a wee hint for the reader in your opening gambit, isn’t there? Personally attacking Trump and spewing lies isn’t hard for you at all, plus you have the added bonus of relieving that pressure build-up in your sick mind that’s driving you crazy. If you say something often enough people will believe you, even if it’s not true. This is sick, Phil, and not in a good way.



Trump hasn’t actually lost his mind but you’re seriously at risk of losing yours by making this stuff up. Crazy is what happens to people who disconnect from reality.



“Sure, there have been terrible presidents before – **_corrupt, cruel and boorish ones; mendacious, vain, ignorant ones; racists, misogynists, and warmongers; incompetents and dilettantes –_** **but only Trump embodies each and every one of those qualities with such unbridled ferocity** _ **.**_ ** _He disgraced the Oval Office by ever setting foot in there; he has been disgracing himself, and anyone that supports him, every day since.”_**



Facts, Phil, facts. Remember, back in the good old days, when journalism meant facts reported without bias? Next time, when you feel the urge, spare the reader and use a bucket for your angst. 



Breathe, Phil, in two-three, out two-three. Now… go away and read some actual facts about Donald Trump. Hopefully, it will restore whatever good sense you had before it got overwhelmed by emotive rage.



“Trump announced he was rolling back Obama-era regulations on methane leaks that will result in the equivalent in climate damage of eight million additional vehicles on the road. **_That’s the whole of New Zealand’s climate change agenda negated multiple times over in one fell swoop.”_**



You might want to sit down about now, okay? Big breath, Phil, big deep breath.



Climate change is a very elaborate hoax. I know! Who knew, right? So, here’s a simple climate change fact for you: there’s not enough CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CO (carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere to cause the warming that the UN and warmist liars would have us believe. The atmosphere is 99.96% CO2 free. Carbon monoxide even less, the atmosphere is 99.9998% carbon monoxide free. So, dude, stop worrying about those eight million extra vehicles because they’ll make bugger-all difference.



“He did so not because the industry demanded it – in fact, most oil and gas giants had come to accept the regulations – but because **_he will do anything within his powers to claw back the [reduction in C02 emissions] legacy of Obama.”_**



Here’s the thing, Phil: Obama’s legacy isn’t what you think it is. Obama was a nutbar who got it wrong on climate change and a whole lot else. American voters are not stupid. Take for instance, a look at some of his foreign policy gaffes. Remember Benghazi? The Iran nuclear deal? The US abstaining from the Security Council resolution which declared the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegal and invalid? And how that stance alienated Bibi Netanyahu?



“ ** _America and the world are paying a heavy price for Trump’s multifarious psychopathologies_**. Neuropsychiatrists are bound by ethics not to bandy about terms like “ ** _rapidly advancing dementia_** ” when it comes to the nuclear button guy, but I’m not.”



Ooh Phil, despite the big words, you’re on a losing streak here. No neuropsychiatrist would risk his career over diagnosing dementia of the democratically elected president of the most powerful country in the free world, without a single personal consultation! 



Now Phil, take your own finger off that nuclear button right now – speaking metaphorically of course. Seriously though, Phil step away from your keyboard; you’ve gone way too far.



“It takes one idiot to make a fool of himself every day he defaces the Oval Office. **_It takes tens of millions to elevate him there.”_**



Yup, tens of millions of people, Phil. People, not fools. People who voted for Trump in 2016 and will do the same thing in 2020 because, strangely enough, they didn’t believe the MSM lies back then and they don’t now. In 2016, voters thought they would be better off with Trump in the White Office than they were with Obama or his sidekick ‘crooked Hillary.’ They were proved right and the MSM was proved wrong. 



I know it hurts Phil, but you have to let it go. You are coming unglued and looking foolish because facts always trump emotional garbage, pun intended.



A word from the wise, Phil; take a media break until after 2020 or maybe, forever. Your mental health could use it and it’d be a shame to see you disintegrate when Trump gets re-elected. You don’t have to keep doing this. I’m not sure your mind can take it and there’s a limit to the verbal vomitus readers will endure. So here’s the Don with a few final words for you to mull over.



“The LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do “fact checking” anymore, and are only looking for the “kill.” They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt.



The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!”

"**Jersey has seen a ""surge"" of 84 new Covid-19 cases since Friday, according to the latest figures.**
This takes the island to 247 active infections, nearly three quarters of which are symptomatic.
Further public health measures and guidance are now due to follow the introduction of mandatory masks use in shops from Tuesday.
The updated government advice suggests islanders work from home where possible.
Those over the age of 70 will be advised to avoid socialising indoors with people they do not live with.
Public health officials explained the changes were needed as the island was experiencing ""complex, multiple clusters"" and a rise which cannot be attributed to a particular event.
More than 2,000 people, nearly 2% of Jersey's population, are isolating as a result of contact tracing, Chief Minister John Le Fondre confirmed.
The full list of measures to be introduced include:
Senator John Le Fondre said: ""This surge in cases is not down to one cluster.
""Health officials are seeing case clusters on a larger scale, and we are worried that the number of positive cases being picked up may indicate an increase in hospitalisation as we move forward.
""In the coming weeks we will see large numbers of returning students, family members and friends visiting for Christmas and enhanced social activity.
""Action is needed now to protect the vulnerable, to identify more cases earlier on and to slow the spread.""
Health Minister Richard Renouf said: ""If this doesn't bring down the numbers of positive cases we may, ultimately, have to move to another lockdown.""
""That's something none of us want to see,"" he added."
"**Single parents say they are struggling to pay bills while self-isolating due to not having access to a Â£500 grant during the coronavirus pandemic.**
People who are forced to stay off work after testing positive for Covid-19 or being contacted by tracers are eligible to apply for the sum.
But parents or carers who need to look after a child sent home from school due to the virus cannot claim.
The Welsh Government said the scheme would be kept ""under review"".
Applications for the Â£500 grants, set up to support those on low incomes, opened a fortnight ago following criticism of a delay in getting it up and running.
People can access the grant if they test positive or are contacted by contact tracers, and cannot work from home during the 14 day self-isolation period.
But charities warned the criteria means those told who had to stay home to look after children, if there were cases at their schools, would not be able to claim.
Ellie Harwood, from the Child Poverty Action Group, said many living in deprived areas would do jobs that could not be done from home, and so would have to go without pay.
""For lone parents, particularly, the prospect of two weeks without any money coming in is really difficult,"" she said.
""We just know that so many families struggle to make ends meet even though they're in work.
""More often than not, particularly with lone parents, there's quite a lot of research that shows that mothers, and it normally is mothers, will go without, they won't eat three meals a day.""
When Louise Hall was told to keep her eight-year-old son off school after a positive case in his year group in October, she had to stop working.
The child therapist, from Newport, said no-one in her support bubble lived nearby to help care for him and she was not eligible for any government support.
She said she had already had to get ""creative and flexible"" with paying bills.
""I needed to be there for my son because he's not old enough to be left at all,"" she said.
""If I don't work, we don't eat and that's very hard as a self-employed person because you have to wait for invoices to be paid anyway, you have to wait for cash flow.""
She said the Â£500 would pay for almost all of her rent, and make a big difference to their lives, and she worried there would be more cases and he would have to isolate again.
Dawn Cartwright, from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, has been home with five of her children for the last two weeks after positive cases were confirmed at their school.
The teaching assistant said she had been living for ""two weeks with no wages at all"" after needing to stay home with them.
""I'm allowed to go to work but working in a primary school, do I go to work and risk spreading the virus or stay at home and look after the children? It's very hard to know what to do,"" she said.
""It's very hard. Christmas is coming up but the bills need paying first. I know a lot of families who are struggling with knowing what to do.""
Ms Cartwright, who has been relying on working tax credits to get by, but said she was now having to decide what bills to pay when she gets her next pay check.
""I'd like them just to think they're asking us to protect people by staying home...but there's no help to be had,"" she said.
Now the action group has called on the Welsh Government to follow Northern Ireland and allow people to claim if anyone in their household is told to self-isolate.
""Sometimes it is easy to overlook the specific circumstances of certain types of families when these schemes are planned,"" Ms Harwood said.
Plaid Cymru said low income working parents of isolating children ""cannot be excluded from self-isolation payments without an alternative"".
The party's equalities spokeswoman Leanne Wood said: ""Alternative childcare is not an option when children are formally required to self-isolate, therefore parents and carers have no other option than to miss work as a result.""
Ms Wood called for the Welsh Government to allow parents to show a child's self-isolation record as proof they were eligible for support.
A Welsh Government spokeswoman said the self-isolation scheme was designed to remove the financial barriers some people face when asked to self-isolate.
""It is similar to the schemes in place elsewhere in the UK,"" she said.
""We keep the scheme under review."""
"Charles Darwin ate one on his trip to Brazil. Apparently it tasted more like pork than chicken. My nine-year-old, football-mad, half-Brazilian son could identify one on his World Cup merchandising and my Brazilian biologist wife knew it was some kind of armadillo, but not which species. It is of course Brazil’s World Cup mascot, the three-banded armadillo, named Fuleco.  It was brave to choose such an obscure animal as an official mascot. The English used a lion when they started this tradition in 1966 and the South Africans used a leopard in 2010. It is refreshing to see such a non-emblematic species chosen – and one that is endangered and needs awareness of its existence to be raised. But I can’t help but feel an opportunity has been lost when it comes to conservation in Brazil. First the name of the mascot: Fuleco. Not even my football-mad son knew its name and my wife had no idea why it was called this. Fuleco is supposed to be a portmanteau of the Brazilian words for football (futebol) and ecology (ecologia), which suggests it should have been “Futeco”. But as my wife pointed out, names beginning with “fut” do not sound good in most languages.  Three-banded armadillos hail from the dry tropical forest lands (the Caatinga) of Brazil’s northeast and they are classified as vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN. In Portuguese they are appropriately called “tatu bola”, which translates to “ball armadillo”. Surely, this name or even “bola” (ball) could have been used to highlight the unique nature of this armadillo.  While this species is famous amongst Brazil’s native population for rolling up into a ball to defend itself, the problem is that there are several other species of armadillo in Brazil that are also well known. So here is the first missed goal: the mascot species is not being properly identified and it’s likely that the majority of the 200m Brazilians who affect its habitat and survival will remain ignorant of its plight. The second missed goal is not to take advantage of a wonderful Brazilian law that allows private companies or individuals to create nature reserves and then “donate” them to the country. Brazil has more than 1,000 of these Private Reserves to Protect Nature (RPPN). Brazilian law allows owners to retain ownership of the land once it has been declared a RPPN, but the land from this point in time onwards can only be a nature reserve, protecting it from environmentally unfriendly exploitation.  Here is the opportunity for a fantastic marketing win that would also score a goal for conservation. FIFA could buy an area of land important for the conservation of Fuleco’s species, and call it the “FIFA World Cup Nature Reserve 2014” if they wished. Of course some endowment money would be needed to maintain the reserve but this would need to generate only a few tens of thousands of dollars per year. This would be a fantastic legacy for the people of Brazil and make a real long-term impact on this species’ conservation. So far FIFA have spent only £27,000 on the three-banded armadillo’s conservation. Some Brazilian wildlife conservation researchers have suggested a green goals project. For every goal scored in the World Cup, 1,000 hectares of land would be bought and used to make a reserve. In the average World Cup there are 170 goals so 170,000 hectares would be protected. This is a good idea, but I think it should be a bonus on top of a base minimum reserve size. I would hate to be cheering for poor defences and bad goal keeping when watching the games with my family. The Brazilian government set aside US$275m for Wildlife Parks to be upgraded for world cup visitors, but less than 1% of this money has been spent. This is against the backdrop of new parliamentary affront in Brazil against the country’s conservation areas and reserves for indigenous peoples: more than 200 politicians (40% of them) actually claim that the creation of conservation areas in Brazil has damaged the lives of many people.  It is true that often the paying out of land payments has progressed at a snail’s pace, but this is the politicians’ fault. And there are other motives at play, considering that many government wildlife reserves sit on top of valuable resources such as gold and diamonds. All this only leads us to ask: why hasn’t the Brazilian government used some of this money to create a new national park to save the three-banded armadillo? The final whistle has not blown on this game. There is still time for both FIFA and the Brazilian government to make a meaningful gesture towards the conservation of Fuleco’s kind. FIFA should try to leave behind lasting legacies in World Cup host countries and this could well be a new National Park to save species from extinction. This would really be a golden goal that everyone can cheer for."
"Wolves are returning to their former ranges across Europe and North America, resurrecting a centuries’ old war with humans over land, hunting opportunities, and livestock. While protected in many areas, the wolf is fighting a losing battle, because in the war against them we’ve recruited something much more deadly than guns, traps, or poison, a more powerful and effective tool for wolf extermination than all of these things combined: the human imagination. Even though we’re all aware of what real wolves are like and can picture them very clearly, perhaps even find them majestic and beautiful, lurking within our collective psyche is the nightmarish Big Bad Wolf whom we came to know so well as children, and who stays with us into adulthood with the fictionalised killers of television and film. I am fiercely pro-wolf and strongly advocate for their return, but I can’t pretend that there isn’t a little part of my brain that sends out danger signals whenever I think about them actually being on my doorstep. Rationally, we know from scientific evidence that wolves pose very little threat to humans (in fact, because of our long-standing persecution of them they tend to avoid us – so much so that even sightings are rare, let alone attacks). Yet it is as if a primal fear of wolves is simply built into human DNA. So as much as I want this aspect of my feelings to go away, it’s just not something that I think ever will.  It’s easy for those who are anti-wolf to capitalise on this fear in order to perpetuate the war between the species. Using the image of the wolf as a bloodthirsty, uncontrollable killer, and the synonymity between wolves and the “wilderness” to great effect, wolf opponents are able to convince others that wolves and people cannot co-exist, especially where farming is concerned. For example, when wolves were spotted in one national park in the Netherlands for the first time in more than a century, the park’s director, Seger Emmanuel baron van Voorst tot Voorst, argued that: Once a wolf has tasted sheep meat it won’t be running after deer. Grazing sheep will be impossible if wolves are in the area, and fences won’t keep them out… We live in a country of 17 million people, not the Serengeti. This indignance at the expectation that humans should adapt to live alongside wolves (“we have been farming in this way for centuries, why should we change that now because of something we don’t even want here?”), epitomises an attitude that is problematic not only for wolves, but for all species of animals: that humans should have primacy over the earth. Humans act as though wolves should respect “our” spaces – that they should recognise areas where they should not go. But wolves don’t know about the imaginary borders between countries, states, inhabited and uninhabited land, “civilisation” and “wilderness”. They don’t know which areas have been designated for their use and protection and which haven’t, and they don’t know that what they’re doing when they step outside these boundaries is “wrong”. Nor do they know that hunting sheep is an offence that is often punishable by death. They are just trying to eat, which is much more difficult than is often thought: fewer than 20% of wolf hunts are successful. Can we really blame them for trying to snag an easy meal?  No wonder they’d rather hunt sheep. (Source: BBC Earth) Realistically, wolves do need management if they are to co-exist with humans.  Unfortunately, we live in a human-dominated world, so we call the shots – literally, if we decide to shoot wolves – but management does not have to be lethal. Fences, auditory and visual defences, guard dogs and even guard llamas can be used in order to deter wolves from attacking livestock. Wolves might even be able to help us in fixing some of the damage that we have inflicted on the earth, by restoring the ecological balance in areas where deer, unchecked in number by a lack of natural predators, have decimated the native plant life. While “rewilding” is sometimes seen as radical (relinquishing our control over nature is simply unthinkable for some) it’s in fact the opposite – it’s putting nature back to the way it was before humans altered its course. Before that happens though, we need to put the Big Bad Wolf to bed. Wolves are not bad – they’re just wolves, trying to survive in a world where they are increasingly unwelcome. In fact, it’s worth considering what a human would look like to a wolf. To them, we’re the killing machines (armed with further killing machines). We’re stealing from their larder when we hunt, displacing them from their homelands, tearing apart their families, and killing their new-born children in their dens. They’re as frightened of us as we are of them, if not more so, and for good reason. While the human-wolf war rages on, perhaps we should consider the possibility that the Big Bad Wolf does not exist, but the Big Bad Human is alive and well."

The clown-show that is the Pacific Islands Forum came to a fitting conclusion yesterday, with a rogues’ gallery of banana republics lining up with their hands out. But, in their greed for foreign handouts, Pacific nations seem dangerously blind to the wolf that they’re inviting into their complacent sheep-fold.



From the earliest days of the Maoist takeover, China has assiduously sought to buy influence in what was then called the “Third World”. For much of the 20th century, Beijing had little more to offer than anti-Imperialist rhetoric. But these days, thanks to Deng Xiaping’s reforms, the communists are awash with cash – and they’re not sparing a single yuan in buying up influence from the greedy and gullible.



China has told Pacific nations it recognises the “legitimate demands” of small island states for tackling climate change, and called on developed countries to “earnestly carry out their obligations” under the Paris agreement.



Well, he would say that now wouldn’t he? The Paris agreement is the absurd fiction that punishing America and the West, bleeding them white of energy and cash while allowing China to merrily belch out as much carbon dioxide as it pleases is somehow “saving the planet”. China is playing the green-left elite of Europe, not to mention camp-followers like Jacinda Ardern, for utter fools.



China’s Special Envoy to the Pacific, Ambassador Wang Xuefeng, told the Pacific Island Forum in Tuvalu today that “no matter how the international situation evolves, China will always be a good friend, partner and brother of Pacific Island countries”.



“China believes that all countries, big or small, are equals,” he said.



Yeah, right. Just ask Taiwan, Tibet or Vietnam.



But the blatant baloney didn’t end there.



Mr Wang talked up his own country’s efforts to tackle reduce its emissions.



Mr Wang told PIF members that China backed “equitable global climate governance regime”…“China firmly upholds the principles and framework of the Convention, and remains committed to the principles of equity, “common but differentiated responsibilities”, and respective capabilities.”



Just a little reminder of the reality behind Beijing’s two-faced rhetoric:



China has 981,000MW of installed coal generation capacity, compared to Australia’s 25,150MW.



But China wasn’t the only participant doling out shovel-loads of self-serving horse-pucky.



Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said …the marathon session, which dragged well into the night, was at times emotional.



“The Prime Minister of Tonga actually cried during the retreat,” he said.



  
But that was only because the buffet closed early.



Economist Judith Sloan didn’t hesitate in calling the PIF for what it really is.



Let’s face it, it’s just a dressed-up cash grab on the part of these leaders…to be lectured by some jumped-up leaders from the Pacific Islands that we should close down our coal industry — with the darling of the left, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s PM, chiming in — is both to underscore their ignorance and demonstrate their extreme naivety.



Australia is handing out half a billion dollars of gibsmedat. How do the Cargo Cultists of the Pacific think we can afford this largesse?



With coal our largest export earner, the closure of this industry would seriously undermine our capacity to provide funds to our neighbours in the Pacific.



They could always demonstrate their commitment to their principles by refusing to take coal-funded cash.

The Latest List of Lies
By Ed Caryl
On Tuesday, June 25, in advance of President Obama’s Climate speech, David Simas, a White House presidential advisor, sent an email to the press corp outlining the governments position on climate change. This missive was so unabashedly full of lies dressed as irrefutable statements that it would have made the most notorious dictator propagandist proud. The refutation is absurdly easy. Let’s break down each paragraph:
The carbon pollution that causes climate change isn’t a distant threat, the risk to public health isn’t a hypothetical, and it’s clear we have a moral obligation to act.”
He is talking about CO2. A CO2 molecule is one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. By weight, CO2 is about 73% oxygen and 27% carbon. He calls it “carbon pollution”, not “oxygen pollution”, because to most people, carbon is a dirty, black substance commonly called soot, and oxygen is life giving for animals. Carbon-soot is what one sees from the exhaust of a poorly tuned diesel truck. That isn’t CO2. CO2 is colorless and odorless. Pure carbon also exists as graphite and diamond.
CO2 is not pollution. It is 0.04% of the atmosphere. If the concentration in the atmosphere falls below 0.02% plants die. CO2 is plant food. It is life for plants. It is fertilizer. It is essential to vegetation. It is harmless to humans until it reaches 1% to 4% of the atmosphere.
CO2 and water vapor are responsible for keeping the earth’s surface habitable. Without CO2 and water vapor, the earth would be much colder. Does too much CO2 increase the temperature? Perhaps, but water vapor is a much larger influence. Water vapor, from the bottom to the top of the atmosphere, is the earth’s thermostat.
Is climate changing? Climate changes all the time; it is called “weather.” Is it a threat? Severe weather has always been a threat. Is it a threat to public health? Sure, but it has always been that way. Recent weather has actually been less extreme than periods in the past. Cold kills more people than heat, so we should be welcoming warmer weather if that is what is happening. Rome expanded during a warm period. Medieval castles and cathedrals were built during a warm period.
We have a moral obligation to act? In what way? Primitive tribes used rain dances. We throw government money at alternative energy companies that promptly go bankrupt. These are equally efficacious activities.
The 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 years, and 2012 was the hottest one we’ve ever recorded. When carbon pollutes the air, the risk of asthma attacks increases. When the Earth’s atmosphere fundamentally changes, we see more heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods.”
The first sentence is half true. 2012 was not the hottest year, 1998 was, according to HADCRUT4 and all the other temperature data sources. There were 7 years out of the last 15 that were hotter than 2012. We are now past the peak of the current temperature cycle, so, of course the hottest years are recent years.
CO2 in the air has no effect on asthma. Other pollutants increase asthma, not CO2.
The earth’s atmosphere has not fundamentally changed. There are not more heat waves, or droughts, or wildfires, or floods. The facts are that all these things either cycle up and down over time, or are decreasing. Wildfires are caused by things that man does like arson, building in pine forests, “controlled” burns, and forest management practices. Floods are caused by urban pavement, levees, and poor flood control dam management, as well as nature.

These events also create an economic imperative to act. When farms wash away and crops wilt, food prices go up. Last year, we saw 11 different weather disasters that each cost the United States more than $1 billion.”
What events? Farms have not washed away in any unusual number, and floods don’t normally wash them away anyway, a flood just makes them very wet for a time. In the 1930’s Dust Bowl they blew way, but this was before the CO2 rise. CO2 makes crops more drought resistant. Food prices have gone up because an area equivalent to Iowa and New Jersey combined are now devoted to corn used to produce ethanol rather than food for beef, chickens, and hogs. This has been a government mandated disaster.
Weather-related losses happen every year. As time passes, more things get built that can be destroyed, and inflation increases the dollar cost.
And confronting this challenge isn’t just about preventing disaster — it’s also about moving America forward in a way that creates hundreds of thousands of good, new, clean energy jobs. It’s about wasting less energy, which saves money for every business and every family in America.”
Of course he is not talking about jobs for oil field workers, pipeline constructors, miners, or gas drillers. He’s talking about government subsidized jobs building bird-blenders (wind-turbines) and bird-incinerators (solar power towers). He’s talking about government loans to “green” companies that then lose it. He’s talking about CFL light bulbs made in China that will be causing mercury pollution for years to come. He’s talking about LNG powered cars and trucks that will explode on impact or during refueling.
So the debate’s over. It’s time for action.”
You don’t get out of the debate by declaring it over and walking away. The debate has just begun. We now have the MSM beginning to let the truth be heard.
Here’s what President Obama is announcing today. Check it out, then help to spread the word.”
Help spread the lies. But don’t think for yourself or investigate.
First, he’s laying out a plan to cut carbon pollution in America — by working to cut pollution from power plants, protect the health of our kids, boost clean energy, and revamp our transportation sector for the 21st century. Second, he’s preparing the United States for the impacts of these changes — by building stronger, safer communities and developing resources to make our country more resilient. And finally, he’s leading international efforts to combat global climate change.”
Raise the cost of energy. Raise government spending on more losing Alternative Energy Schemes. Make a case for more gun control. Give DHS more power. Raise the cost of health care. Make big government even bigger, and charge at international windmills.
We’ve put together a graphic that breaks this all down — from the effects we’re already seeing to the specific actions we’re going to take to lead this fight.”
The effects: food prices taking off, energy prices skyrocketing, and now more efforts to enhance both of those effects.
No single step can reverse the effects of climate change, but that’s no excuse for inaction. We have a moral obligation to leave our kids a planet that’s not broken and polluted.
None of those steps will have any affect on something that happens naturally. They will, however, increase costs, put more downward pressure on jobs, and further depress an already depressed economy. In the end, it will leave our kids a planet with poor job prospects, food prices they can’t afford, and energy prices that will reduce their standard of living, restrict mobility, and make it harder to heat their hovels. And that will really be a broken planet.

"When 110 people gathered at a hotel in Birmingham in January for the UK’s first citizens’ assembly on the climate crisis, the world was a very different place. The assembly culminates this weekend after its final meeting in March was postponed and moved online due to the coronavirus outbreak, bringing a host of logistical challenges.  “We decided to split the same content over three weekends – I don’t know how you’re finding lockdown, but I’m certainly finding there’s a limit to how much time I want to spend on an online video call in one day,” said Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, the public participation charity that is running the assembly. “Also it’s hard for people, for example with young children, to be on a call all day rather than for shorter periods of time.” Fundamentally, however, the format is the same, with assembly members hearing from expert speakers, asking questions and discussing issues in small groups, and using a secure online system to cast their votes. “In some ways, it’s surprising how little has changed,” added Allan. Those without internet access were able to join via their landline, with printed resources sent in the post. But as with the many other aspects of life that have moved online in recent weeks, there have been hiccups. One participant, Ellie, a 21-year-old trainee teacher living in north London, moved back to rural Devon to be with family before the lockdown, and had some technical problems while joining the virtual meetings. “That made discussion quite challenging,” she said. “And people have families coming in and out, and pets – sometimes it’s a little bit chaotic, but quite endearing and lovely to see where everyone is from.” The assembly is made up of 110 people selected by computer to be representative of society from a pool of 1,500, who asked to be considered after invitations were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random. Over the past few weeks, experts have talked to them about a wide range of topics, including energy production, transport, agriculture and consumerism, with participants voting on a series of propositions related to each with a view to determining how the UK could best achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. On this final weekend the assembly will be discussing how the coronavirus pandemic affects the climate crisis, and members will be given an opportunity to raise any issues they do not feel have been addressed throughout – for instance, whether the UK deadline of 2050 for meeting net zero should be brought forward. Ellie said she was aware of the urgency of the issue before joining the assembly, and her views have remained pretty consistent throughout the process. “My feelings as it’s coming to an end reflect how I felt when I initially found out I was going to be taking part,” she said. “I’m really thrilled that we got to make a contribution and I was able to be a part of it.” But 52-year-old Adrian from Belfast, who works in the legal sector, said he had become much more aware of the effects of his individual actions. “I think having children makes you more aware of how you behave and the shadow that you cast across,” he said. “It’s the things that I can do, and the things I can change – in your routine, the way you live, how you travel – that’s the great takeaway for me.” The assembly does not aim to provide a definitive consensus on issues, but to provide a snapshot of public opinion: if the participants are divided on an issue, the final report will reflect that. It is due to be published before the parliamentary summer recess starts in July, an exciting but also nerve-racking prospect for the participants. “I think I’m cautious about the impact it will have politically,” said Ellie. “I definitely hope this will have a tangible impact and it will gain some kind of recognition. I’m sure it will gain some criticism as well.” It is not yet known whether the report will be debated in parliament, although it will be used by the six select committees that commissioned it – and perhaps in other organisations as well. “I think it will be really interesting to see how it’s used by other people beyond parliament once it’s published,” said Allan. Assembly members said they were aware the coronavirus pandemic had completely transformed society, and perhaps shifted public focus away from the climate crisis. But Covid-19 had also created a unique opportunity for a national and global reset. “We would hope that [when] restarting the economy, some of the decisions made will be influenced by some of the suggestions we make here,” said Adrian, noting the rise in cycling and walking since the lockdown. “Sometimes after these events [such as the coronavirus crisis] people have a greater community consciousness, and perhaps now is the time to use the recommendations to ignite that.” The participants are hopeful that, now or in the future, their recommendations do help shape the country in a way that benefits the environment in the long term. “I think the change will happen. It’s the speed at which it happens which is the key,” said Adrian. “But as I see those changes being made, I’ll be able to smile and look at them and say, ‘Well, I did that’.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDavid Robert Grimes of the Irish Times latest piece pretty much tells us all we all need to know about the state of mind of climate alarmists nowadays: it’s one of mounting frustration that’s on the verge of exploding anger. Are calls for anger what one typically sees from the winning side of a debate? Certainly not.
What we are actually seeing appears to be the frustration one sees from the losing side, a side that had gone in thinking victory was sure. Like an 8-year old losing a checker game to a brighter 4-year old.
The humiliation is evident.
He writes: “If greenhouse emissions continue their steady escalation, temperatures across most of the earth will rise to levels with no recorded precedent by the middle of this century, researchers say.” Notice here how Grimes writes “temperature will rise” and not “temperature is rising“. He is telling us not look at the current model performance, but to just wait another 40 years. He has to do this because all the models have been dead wrong. And what Grimes fails to understand is that if the models are wrong today, then they can’t be used for the future. In fact neither Grimes nor any scientist has even a single scrap of data that would allow them to predict the future. It’s all scenario and speculation.
Misinterprets the warming stop as “bleak”
He writes: “The findings are bleak, but not unexpected.” False. The findings are unexpected. Not a single IPCC model got the temperatures for the last fifteen years correct. All overstated the temperature rise. So this is good news and certainly not “bleak”. Only psychologically abnormal persons would not feel some sense of relief. The stop in temperature rise is unexpected and thus can be nothing but good news – period.
Obsessive catastrophe wishers
Clearly Grimes comes across as an obsessive and irrational catastrophe-wisher. No data, news, or even therapy, are going to change the mindset of the obsessive alarmists. They seem to have an acute, unexplainable allergy to the bearers of good news, especially from “publications like the Daily Mail, the Wall Street Journal and numerous Murdoch press.” All good news that gets presented absolutely has to be defeated.
Grimes denies real data, embraces model scenarios
Grimes also accuses the skeptics of denialism, claiming they are practicing a “stubborn and persistent refusal to acknowledge what the evidence shows beyond all reasonable doubt.” All we can say here is that Grimes only needs to look at the performance of the models, storm statistics, Antarctic sea ice trends, the missing tropospheric hot spot, and especially the ABANDONED hockey stick. Who’s really in denial? Which scientists are puzzled by the missing heat and are scrambling to make up excuses for it?

Alarmist journalists qualified, skeptic ones not?
In his rant, Grimes gripes about the skeptic politicians and press, even attacking columnists James Delingpole and David Rose for challenging the science and claiming they have “no qualification to do so.” Such a stupid argument. Delingpole and Rose are just as qualified to challenge the science as Grimes and Borenstein are qualified to endorse it. In the end data decide, and not the scientists with the longest resumes. This guy went to Oxford?
Concedes complexity that skeptics claimed for years
Grimes also hints that climate science is too complex to be decided by the public: “Climate is a deeply complex system, not a simple thermostat.” Unfortunately this is not what the alarmist climate scientists told us for more than 20 years. In fact they told us just the opposite: Climate and global temperature boil down to the concentration of trace gas CO2. Even Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber said so on camera. And all their simple climate models told us the same. It is us skeptics who have been telling the world that the climate is far more complex and that the simple CO2-global temperature correlation was preposterous. And now that there has not been any warming in 15 years, the alarmists are now finally waking up and coming around to this reality.
Calls for anger, emotionalization have no place in science
Grimes is emotional and frustrated, and thus cannot be taken seriously anymore. His scientific understanding has been fatally compromised by his increasingly emotional state. Calls for mob anger and emotionalization have no place in science.
Finally Grimes writes: “Worse than this, depleting ice-sheets increase tectonic and volcanic activity as the confining loads on these systems are stripped away, increasing seismic activity.”
Now that I’m done laughing, to this I can only say that it amazes me that Oxford University would actually graduate people capable of such flaming nonsense. Grimes actually confuses far-fetched raw hypotheses as settled science.
From a science point a view, Grimes offers nothing. All we can do is give him high marks for entertainment. His behavior is exactly what us skeptics were looking forward to seeing from the spoiled elitist losers 10 years ago when were pretty sure we were going to win this debate. The entertainment begins.

"**A Sheffield shisha bar which breached Covid-19 regulations has been fined Â£2,000 and had 70 pipes seized.**
Officers found 20 people inside the venue on the Wicker on Friday, with Â£200 fixed penalty notices handed out to all inside.
South Yorkshire Police said it had received numerous reports about the bar breaching rules.
Both police and the council had made previous visits to the business advising it of the regulations.
Insp John Mallows, from the force's city centre neighbourhood team, said: ""We want the public to know that police and local authorities will take action to address Covid-19 breaches and the warrant is one example of our partnership working to tackle repeated issues.
""Individuals who seek to ignore the rules and put both theirs and other lives at risk will face enforcement action.""

"February 2020 was the wettest February on record for the UK and the fifth wettest of any calendar month in a series dating back to 1862. 209mm of rain fell across the country, and some areas recorded as much as four times their normal February rainfall, resulting in severe flooding. So how does this compare to the UK’s wettest month on record: October 1903? The records show that 227mm of rain fell during October 1903, but the observations are not detailed enough to show precisely where and when the most intense rainfall occurred. That’s because thousands of meticulous weather observations are recorded in copperplate hand-writing, but haven’t yet made it to digital form.  Now they have! A call for volunteers to use Covid-19 lockdown time to help rescue rainfall records has resulted in over 15,000 people transcribing all five million UK rainfall measurements recorded between 1820 and 1960, in the space of just three weeks. Once the data has been double checked scientists will be able to compare exceptional months like October 1903 and February 2020, and understand the variation in British weather. Meanwhile, more data awaits. “The next project will be at sea, looking at ship weather logbooks,” says Ed Hawkins, who leads the Weather Rescue project.  "
"Norway’s gigantic sovereign wealth fund has dumped its stake in the Australian energy company AGL, which owns coal-fired power stations including the carbon-intensive Liddell plant in New South Wales, after tightening up its rules on fossil fuels. Norges Bank, which manages the US$1.1tn Government Pension Fund Global, has also put Australian mining giant BHP on an “observation list”, placing it at risk of divestment in the future.  The fund, which is so big it owns an estimated 1.5% of shares listed on the global stock exchange, invests the spoils of Norway’s own North Sea oil bonanza. However, over the past few years it has adopted progressively stricter rules about investing in fossil fuels. Its latest rules, brought into force in December, allow it to exclude or put on observation companies that get 30% or more of their income from thermal coal, base 30% or more of their operations on thermal coal, produce more than 20m tons of thermal coal a year or produce power of more than 10,000MW from thermal coal. It is believed AGL has been disqualified because of its coal mine at Loy Yang in Victoria. The company had hoped to close its elderly Liddell coal-fired plant in 2022 but after a political bunfight has pushed the date into the following year. Glencore, which has assets in Australia and produces more than 130m tons of coal a year, has also been struck from the fund’s list of permitted investments. BHP also holds extensive thermal coal assets, although it has recently been moving towards selling them. Norges Bank said the fund had sold out of companies it has put on the banned list. At the end of last year it owned a 0.46% stake of AGL, worth roughly A$65m. “For several of the companies of which exclusion is now being made public, the market situation, including the liquidity of individual shares, has meant that it has taken a long time to sell the shares in a reasonable manner,” Norges Bank said.  “That explains why a long period of time has passed between some of the decisions and the publication.” Activist shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said it showed that AGL and BHP, which it described as “iconic” Australian companies, were both “well behind the times”. The group’s executive director, Brynn O’Brien, said the companies did not have credible strategies to move to more climate-friendly business models. “Sophisticated investors like the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund look past the feelgood advertising and flimsy climate commitments of companies like AGL and BHP and see that coal businesses have no future,” she said. “They also know that coal investments are a direct threat to the profitability of other sectors in which they invest, like agriculture, property and tourism. The Norwegian fund has clearly not seen enough progress from either of these companies, and in the case of AGL has reached the decision that continuing to invest poses too great a risk.” O’Brien said it was part of a trend of investors expressing their concern about the policies of Australian fossil fuel companies. More than 50% of investors in the oil and gas company Woodside recently supported a non-binding motion calling on it to adopt climate targets consistent with the Paris agreement not just for its own greenhouse gas emissions, but for the “scope 3” emissions released when its customers use its products.  Similar motions were backed by 43% and 37% of shareholders of Santos and Rio Tinto, respectively."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
In the process of writing my piece about Lisa Jackson and the EPA, I got to reading about the EPA passing new mercury regulations. Their regulations are supposed to save the lives of some 11,000 people per year. So I figured I should learn something about mercury. It turned out to be quite surprising … here was my first surprise:
Figure 1. Natural and anthropogenic sources of atmospheric mercury emissions. About 7,500 tonnes of mercury are emitted into the atmosphere each year. Named countries show anthropogenic (human caused) emissions for that country.
My first surprise was that far and away the largest emitter of atmospheric mercury is the ocean. The ocean? I’d never have guessed that. Other huge emitters are various lightly vegetated land areas. In addition, forests, volcanoes, and geothermal vents are significant emitters … which is the reason for my new religious crusade:


So … what are the anthropogenic sources of mercury emissions, and how much of those are emitted from North America? Figure 2 shows those values:
Figure 2. North American emissions versus the rest of the world.
As you can see, North America is not doing well at all in the mercury emission sweepstakes. The rest of the world is busting our chops, easily out-emitting us in all categories. We’ve fallen way, way behind, the Chinese are kicking our emissionary fundament-als. Not only that, but the residence time for mercury in the atmosphere is about a year, so they get our mercury … but we also get theirs …
Now, the “stationary combustion” figures are what the EPA is targeting with their new restrictions. Those are mostly the coal-fired power plants. So let’s see how much of the global emissions are caused by US power plants:
Figure 3. US power plant mercury emissions, and emissions from all other sources.
As you can see, the US power plants emit less than 1% of the global mercury emissions. Even if the EPA could get rid of every US coal plant, it will not make a measurable difference in the atmospheric mercury.
Now, here comes the fun part. The new EPA regulations will not cut out all the mercury from US power plants. We’re already pretty efficient at removing mercury, and each additional reduction comes with more difficulty.
So let’s assume that the EPA regs will cut out 25 tonnes of mercury per year. This is supposed to save 11,000 lives every year. So that means if we could wave a magical wand and cut out all of the mercury, 100 percent of it, we should expect to save about 11,000 times 7500/25 = 11,000 times 300 = 3,300,000 lives saved every year … and if you believe that three million people die every year from mercury poisoning, you too could get a job with the EPA.
That’s the thing about facts. As Homer Simpson says,
Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that’s even remotely true!

Elmer, of Minnesotans for Global Warming famous “Hide the Decline” fame, has a keen eye for comic opportunity, much like our esteemed cartoonist, Josh. He’s produced a new video today. Normally I don’t allow videos of this type, what with the “d-word” and all, but when its about you, I think I can grant myself a pass. Have a look.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly posts in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.   
  
_The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer-reviewed literature, or that has been peer-screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.   
  
**********   
  
The recent publication of two articles in _Nature_ magazine proclaiming a link to rainfall extremes (and flooding) to global warming, added to the heat in Russia and the floods in Pakistan in the summer of 2010, and the back-to-back cold and snowy winters in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, have gotten a lot of public attention. This includes a recent hearing in the House of Representatives, despite its Republican majority. Tying weather extremes to global warming, or using them as “proof” that warming doesn’t exist (see: snowstorms), is a popular rhetorical flourish by politicos of all stripes.   
  
The hearing struck many as quite odd, inasmuch as it is much clearer than apocalyptic global warming that the House is going to pass meaningless legislation commanding the EPA to cease and desist from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. “Meaningless” means that it surely will not become law. Even on the long-shot probability that it passes the Senate, the President will surely veto, and there are nowhere near enough votes to override such an action.   
  
Perhaps “wolf!” has been cried yet again. A string of soon-to-be-published papers in the scientific literature finds that despite all hue and cry about global warming and recent extreme weather events, natural climate variability is to blame.   
  
Where to start? How about last summer’s Russian heat wave?   
  
The Russian heat wave (and to some degree the floods in Pakistan) have been linked to the same large-scale, stationary weather system, called an atmospheric “blocking” pattern. When the atmosphere is “blocked” it means that it stays in the same configuration for period of several weeks (or more) and keeps delivering the same weather to the same area for what can seem like an eternity to people in the way. Capitalizing on the misery in Russia and Pakistan, atmospheric blocking was added to the list of things that were supposed to be “consistent with” anthropogenically stimulated global warming which already, of course included heat waves and floods. And thus the Great Russian Heat Wave of 2010 became part of global warming lore.   
  
But then a funny thing happened – scientists with a working knowledge of atmospheric dynamics started to review the situation and found scant evidence for global warming.   
  
The first chink in the armor came back in the fall of 2010, when scientists from the Physical Sciences Division (PSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented the results of their preliminary investigation on the web , and concluded that “[d]espite this strong evidence for a warming planet, **greenhouse gas forcing fails to explain the 2010 heat wave over western Russia**. The natural process of atmospheric blocking, and the climate impacts induced by such blocking, are the principal cause for this heat wave.”   
  
The PSD folks have now followed this up with a new peer-reviewed article in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ that rejects the global warming explanation. The paper is titled “Was There a Basis for Anticipating the 2010 Russian Heat Wave?” Turns out that there wasn’t.   
  
To prove this, the research team, led by PSD’s Randall Dole, first reviewed the observed temperature history of the region affected by the heat wave (western Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine, and the Baltic nations). To start, they looked at the recent antecedent conditions: “Despite record warm globally-averaged surface temperatures over the first six months of 2010, Moscow experienced an unusually cold winter and a relatively mild but variable spring, providing no hint of the record heat yet to come.” Nothing there.   




Then they looked at the long-term temperature record: “The July surface temperatures for the region impacted by the 2010 Russian heat wave shows no significant warming trend over the prior 130-year period from 1880 to 2009…. A linear trend calculation yields a total temperature change over the 130 years of -0.1°C (with a range of 0 to -0.4°C over the four data sets [they examined]).” There’s not a hint of a build-up to a big heat wave.   
  
And as to the behavior of temperature extremes: “There is also no clear indication of a trend toward increasing warm extremes. The prior 10 warmest Julys are distributed across the entire period and exhibit only modest clustering earlier in this decade, in the 1980s and in the 1930s…. This behavior differs substantially from globally averaged annual temperatures, for which eleven of the last twelve years ending in 2006 rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record since 1850….”   
  
With regard any indication that “global” warming was pushing temperatures higher in Russia and thus helped to fuel the extreme heat last summer, Dole et al. say this: “With no significant long-term trend in western Russia July surface temperatures detected over the period 1880-2009, mean regional temperature changes are thus very unlikely to have contributed substantially to the magnitude of the 2010 Russian heat wave.”   
  
Next the PSD folks looked to see if the existing larger-scale antecedent conditions, fed into climate models would produce the atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e. blocking) that gave rise to the heat wave. The tested “predictors” included patterns of sea surface temperature and arctic ice coverage, which most people feel have been subject to some human influence. No relationship: “These findings suggest that the blocking and heat wave were not primarily a forced response to specific boundary conditions during 2010.”   
  
In fact, the climate models exhibited no predilection for projecting increases in the frequency of atmospheric blocking patterns over the region as greenhouse gas concentrations increased. Just the opposite: “Results using very high-resolution climate models suggest that the number of Euro-Atlantic blocking events will decrease by the latter half of the 21st century.”   
  
At this point, Dole and colleagues had about exhausted all lines of inquiry and summed things up: 



Our analysis points to a primarily natural cause for the Russian heat wave. This event appears to be mainly due to internal atmospheric dynamical processes that produced and maintained an intense and long-lived blocking event. Results from prior studies suggest that it is likely that the intensity of the heat wave was further increased by regional land surface feedbacks. The absence of long-term trends in regional mean temperatures and variability together with the model results indicate that it is very unlikely that warming attributable to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations contributed substantially to the magnitude of this heat wave.



Can’t be much clearer than that.   
  
But that was last summer. What about the past two winters? Both were very cold in the eastern U.S. with record snows events and/or totals scattered about the country.   
  
Cold, snow, and global warming? On Christmas Day 2010, the _New York Times_ ran an op-ed by Judah Cohen, a long-range forecaster for the private forecasting firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research, outlining his theory as to how late summer Arctic ice declines lead to more fall snow cover across Siberia which in turn induces atmospheric circulation patterns to favor snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S. Just last week, the Union of Concerned Scientists held a news conference where they handed out a press release  headlined “Climate Change Makes Major Snowstorms Likely.” In that release, Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, laid out his theory as to how the loss of Arctic sea ice is helping to provide more moisture to fuel winter snowstorms across the U.S. as well as altering atmospheric circulation patterns into a preferred state for big snowstorms. Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters chimed in with “Heavy snowstorms are not inconsistent with a warming planet.”   
  
As is the wont for this _Wisdom_ , let’s go back to the scientific literature.   
  
Another soon-to-be released paper to appear in _Geophysical Research Letters_ describes the results of using the seasonal weather prediction model from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to help untangle the causes of the unusual atmospheric circulation patterns that gave rise to the harsh winter of 2009-2010 on both sides of the Atlantic. A team of ECMWF scientists led by Thomas Jung went back and did experiments changing initial conditions that were fed into the ECMWF model and then assessed how well the model simulated the known weather patterns of the winter of 2009-2010. The different set of initial conditions was selected so as to test all the pet theories behind the origins of the harsh winter. Jung et al. describe their investigations this way: “Here, the origin and predictability of the unusual winter of 2009/10 are explored through numerical experimentation with the ECMWF Monthly forecasting system. More specifically, the role of anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice, the tropical atmospheric circulation, the stratospheric polar vortex, solar insolation and near surface temperature (proxy for snow cover) are examined.”   
  
Here is what they found after running their series of experiments.   
  
_Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies_. These are often associated with global warming caused by people. Finding: “These results suggest that neither SST nor sea ice anomalies explain the negative phase of the NAO during the 2009/10 winter.”   
  
(NAO are the commonly used initials for the North Atlantic Oscillation – and atmospheric circulation pattern that can act to influence winter weather in the eastern U.S. and western Europe. A negative phase of the NAO is associated with cold and stormy weather and during the winter of 2009-10, the NAO value was the lowest ever observed.)   
  
_A global warming-induced weakening stratospheric (upper-atmosphere) jetstream_. ""Like for the other experiments, these stratospheric relaxation experiments fail to reproduce the magnitude of the observed NAO anomaly.""   
  
_Siberian snow cover._ “The resulting [upper air patterns] show little resemblance with the observations…. The implied weak role of snow cover anomalies is consistent with other research….”   
  
_Solar variability._ “The experiments carried out in this study suggest that the impact of anomalously low incoming [ultraviolet] radiation on the tropospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region are very small… suggesting that the unusually low solar activity contributed little, if any, to the observed NAO anomaly during the 2009/10 winter.”   
  
Ok then, well what did cause the unusual weather patterns during the 2009-10 winter? 



The results of this study, therefore, increase the likelihood that both the development and persistence of negative NAO phase resulted from internal atmospheric dynamical processes.



Translation: Random variability.   
  
To drive this finding home, here’s another soon-to-be-released paper (D’Arrigo et al., 2001) that uses tree ring-based reconstructions of atmospheric circulation patterns and finds a similar set of conditions (including a negative NAO value second only to the 2009-10 winter) was responsible for the historically harsh winter of 1783-84 in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, which was widely noted by historians. It followed the stupendous eruption of the Icelandic volcano Laki the previous summer. The frigid and snowy winter conditions have been blamed on the volcano. In fact, Benjamin Franklin even commented as much.   
  
But in their new study, Roseanne D’Arrigo and colleagues conclude that the harshness of that winter primarily was the result of anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns that closely resembled those observed during the winter of 2009-10, and that the previous summer’s volcanic eruption played a far less prominent role:   
  
Our results suggest that Franklin and others may have been mistaken in attributing winter conditions in 1783-4 mainly to Laki or another eruption, rather than unforced variability.   
  
Similarly, conditions during the 2009-10 winter likely resulted from natural [atmospheric] variability, not tied to greenhouse gas forcing… Evidence thus suggests that these winters were linked to the rare but natural occurrence of negative NAO and El Niño events.   
  
The point is that natural variability can and does produce extreme events on every time scale, from days (e.g., individual storms), weeks (e.g., the Russian heat wave), months (e.g., the winter of 2009-10), decades (e.g., the lack of global warming since 1998), centuries (e.g., the Little Ice Age), millennia (e.g., the cycle of major Ice Ages), and eons (e.g., snowball earth).   
  
Folks would do well to keep this in mind next time global warming is being posited for the weather disaster _du jour_. Almost assuredly, it is all hype and little might.   
  
Too bad these results weren’t given a “hearing” in the House!

So EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is gone, the environmentalists’ noirest _bete noire_ since James Watt ran the Interior Department early in the Reagan Administration. He will be replaced (at least temporarily) by Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a longtime Washington insider with a keen knowledge of the Agency. He served as chief of staff for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees all EPA activities, and he also has extensive and diverse experience as a lobbyist.   
  
  
He’s likely to be lower key than Pruitt, but also very effective, given his thick rolodex. He’s certain to continue EPA’s efforts to separate its science advisors from its research largess. He’ll likely continue to prioritize and streamline remediation of the 1000+ “superfund” sites nationwide, a key Pruitt program. And he most assuredly will not bring back anything like the Obama Administration’s clean power plan with its “renewable” solar and wind power mandates. Instead, the switch from coal to more efficient gas‐​fired power plants is likely to continue.   
  
  
The linchpin of EPA’s regulatory apparatus for global warming is the 2009 “Endangerment Finding” from emissions of carbon dioxide. According to the 2007 Supreme Court decision in _Massachusetts v. EPA,_ if the Agency finds that resultant global warming endangers health and welfare, it can then regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.   
  
  
The Finding is in turn based upon prospective climate change generated by large computer models both for climate and an estimate of its “social cost”. In 2016, _Science_ magazine carried a news story by Paul Voosen noting that all of the climate models used by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been “tuned” to simulate 20th century climate changes. This includes a substantial warming from 1910 to 1945, despite the fact that there was very little additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere when it began.   
  
  
In 2017, France’s Frederic Hourdin and 14 coauthors published a landmark paper called “The Art and Science of Model Tuning” in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_. Among other things, they revealed that there is an “anticipated acceptable range” of output. Who decides that?   
  
  
It turns out that the forecasts of 21st century climate change are subjectively bounded. Voosen’s article describes the problems encountered at the Max‐​Planck Institute when their model produced seven degrees (C) of warming for doubled carbon dioxide. “They had to get that number down”, Voosen wrote.   
  
  
Then there’s the whole problem of the “social cost of carbon” calculated by the Obama Administration to justify its sweeping “Clean Power Plan”. As shown by Kevin Dayaratna and colleagues at the Heritage Foundation, that cost is extremely sensitive to changes in prospective warming, and conceivably can be negative (i.e. a benefit) for modest warming, because carbon dioxide itself is a boon to plant growth, which includes crops.   
  
  
Just last month, EPA proposed a revised method to calculate the cost, which cut the previous estimate by around 85%.   
  
  
The model tuning, and the subjective estimates of both the amount and costs of future warming, indeed may endanger the Endangerment Finding itself. The new Acting Administrator should revisit that critical 2009 document.

This is NOT satire.  
I REPEAT.  
This is NOT Satire



In another case where the truth is stranger than fiction Green list MP, Associate Transport Minister and writer of [secret letters,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/jags-secret-letter-flouts-the-cabinet-manual/) Julie Anne _“Car Fascist”_ Genter has been exposed for ordering an investigation into BANNING Petrol car imports by 2035.  




Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter ordered an investigation into a total ban on petrol car imports by 2035 among a range of options to reduce emissions in the national transport fleet.  
An array of documents, including an excerpt from a draft cabinet paper from April last year, reveal Genter instructed officials to work on the policy, before scrapping the plan.  
But **National says the fact the plan was even worked on was “irresponsible”.**  
A Ministry of Transport (MoT) report from September last year showed officials had been instructed to “progress an initiative to regulate an end-date of 2035 to the import of light vehicles that are unable to be driven without fossil-fuels”.  
  
  
In other words, **Genter wanted to ban the import of all cars which still use petrol by 2035.**  
  
[…] MoT officials progressed work and presented a report in October last year titled “Ban on Importing Light Vehicles Powered by Fossil Fuels; Preliminary Cost-Benefit Analysis”.  
This report looked into the pros and cons of such a ban.  
But, due to the “lack of information, time and resources”, the cost-benefit analysis was not able to take a number of key issues into consideration.  
  
For example, how such a ban would affect EVs was not looked into, nor was the impacts on electricity prices and the road safety impacts of changing New Zealand’s vehicle fleet so dramatically.  
The report said the main benefit for consumers would be the saving people would make when it comes to not having to buy petrol.  
  
[…] Genter’s proposal was never taken to Cabinet – “it was rejected and ruled out”.  
  
National transport spokesman Chris Bishop said the fact a Cabinet paper was produced showed she was **working behind closed doors to change the law**.   
“Reducing emissions from our vehicle fleet is an important step in the fight against climate change.  
“But it would be irresponsible to make petrol cars illegal so soon without a solid plan to help people into electric vehicles,” he said.

Yesterday, the governors of California and New York signed legislation to raise their states’ minimum wage over the next few years to $15 an hour throughout California and much of New York. Similar proposals are percolating in other state and local governments, and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called for a national minimum wage of $15/hour.   
  
Predictably, critics of raising the minimum wage are arguing that the higher wage floor will hurt employment for low-skill workers, the very people the wage floor is intended to help. A worker will be employed only if the value of his output is greater than the cost of employing him—a cost that includes wages, employer payroll taxes (e.g., Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance), training and outfitting costs, the new health care mandate and other benefits, etc. According to these opponents, the higher wage floor will reduce employment for low-skill workers and encourage employers to find non-labor ways to accomplish low-skill tasks (e.g., ATM machines, self-serve gas pumps, vending machines, automated phone answering systems).   
  
Wage-increase supporters dismiss this concern, claiming there’s no proof that a higher wage floor hurts employment. A very large body of empirical research indicates otherwise, however, with the negative effects falling mainly on workers below age 25 (which isn’t surprising, as 77% of workers earning the federal minimum wage are below age 25, and they have few demonstrated work skills). Wage-increase supporters can argue the research isn’t unanimous, but given the one-sidedness of the extensive empirical evidence, that argument sounds a bit like climate change denial—if not creation science.   
  
More thoughtful wage-increase supporters have begun offering a different argument: Yes, they concede, raising the minimum wage can hurt low-skill employment. But that harm is a worthwhile tradeoff for better wages for the remaining low-skill work: some workers may lose their jobs or some work hours, but others will get a raise.   
  
This argument is important and interesting—in a Marie Antoinette* sort of way.   




Consider this snippet from a recent _Washington Post_ “Wonkblog” post, “The $15 Minimum Wage Sweeping the Nation Might Kill Jobs—And That’s Okay”:   




""Why shouldn’t we in fact accept job loss?” asks New School economics and urban policy professor David Howell, who’s about to publish a white paper on the subject. ""What’s so bad about getting rid of crappy jobs, forcing employers to upgrade, and having a serious program to compensate anyone who is in the slightest way harmed by that?""   
  
""The problem with having a criterion of 'no job loss' is that it guarantees that the minimum wage will always be at a level so low that it won’t come close to achieving [a] living wage standard,” Howell says.   
  
… “It could be that [low-skill workers] spend more time unemployed, but their income is higher overall,” says David Cooper, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. “If you were to tell me I could work fewer hours, and make as much or more than I could have previously, that would be okay.”   
  
Cooper still thinks there’s a lot more research to be done to understand how higher minimum wages affect the bottom of the labor market. He does think the risk of job loss is worth factoring into the decision of where to set the wage floor. But he also agrees that it’s worth forging into those uncharted waters to see what might await.



This thinking raises two questions: who decides what a “crappy” job is, and who decides what particular tradeoff between less employment and a higher wage floor is “okay”? Howell says the decider is “we,” but it’s unclear who “we” is and what qualifies him/her to make that decision for all workers and employers. Cooper says the decider should be he, but what entitles Cooper to make that decision for everyone? Of course, the decider will be politicians, but are their decisions really made out of concern and understanding for the well-being of low-skill workers (not to mention all other people)?   
  
Howell and (apparently) Cooper think such decisions are justified because they’d ensure that every worker earns a “living wage.” Beyond the obvious problem that “a living wage” is a nonsensical term—a living is provided by income, not rate of income—there likely are plenty of workers who would trade their labor for less than whatever Howell and Cooper stipulate is an acceptable wage: pre-teens who will babysit for Mall money, teenagers who want to buy their first car, college students who want an internship, first-time workers who are willing to “pay their dues” in pursuit of higher ambitions, young workers who have low living costs, people who want to work for some high-minded cause, family members who want to make a little money while helping an entrepreneurial relative, seniors who want some extra cash (and responsibility), and so forth.   
  
Howell and Cooper would reply that such workers should be assisted by social programs to help “anyone who is in the slightest way harmed by” their stipulated wage floor. But students who want opportunity-providing internships, or first-time workers who want to build and demonstrate work skills, or relatives who want to lend a hand in the family business in return for a little money, or seniors who want a little extra cash don’t want a handout and some vocational training—they want a job.   
  
One of the great things about free labor markets is that, because employment is voluntary, each worker can set his own wage floor. That’s why few workers—especially full-time workers—work for the minimum wage: they demand higher compensation, though each makes his or her own tradeoff between wage demands and employment.   
  
Of course, some workers do work for the minimum wage, and many of them think that wage is lousy. But what’s even lousier is _not_ being able to work for the minimum wage, and _not_ being able to gain the work experience that would help them move on to better-paying jobs. That’s why it’s hard to accept the idea that workers would be better off if they were prohibited from deciding those tradeoffs for themselves, and instead have Cooper or “we” decide it for all of them.   
  
And that’s why this argument sounds an awful lot like “Let them eat cake”: Howell and Cooper believe they--or politicians--should stipulate the minimum that each and every worker should receive for his or her labor--even if some of those workers would have accepted less, and even if some (and perhaps many) of those workers end up getting nothing. Though Howell and Cooper undoubtedly are motivated by noble intentions, it’s hard to see how their idea is all that noble.   
  
* In fairness to Marie Antoinette, the “Let them eat cake!” tale is almost certainly apocryphal.

Haiti recently was devastated by a massive earthquake. Yet social desolation in Haiti long preceded the natural disaster. The tragic Caribbean nation does not have the economic freedom and legal stability necessary to build a prosperous economy.



Much goes into the process of economic development. One of the most important factors is the protection of property rights, both physical and intellectual. Today the Property Rights Alliance (PRA) released its latest annual _International Property Rights Index_ (IPRI), written by Victoria Strokova, with contributions from many others. Countries which do the most to strengthen property rights have the best economic results.



Prosperity is not everything, of course. As Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman observed: “The preservation of liberty, not the promotion of efficiency, is the primary justification for private property. Efficiency is a happy, though not accidental, by‐​product.”





Property rights promote justice, allowing people at all economic strata to enjoy the fruit of their labor.



Americans enjoy believing that the U.S. is the most market‐​oriented society on earth. But the U.S. is not number one on general economic freedom indexes, though it remains in the top ten. America doesn’t even fall within the top ten on protecting property rights. The U.S. was 15 — not bad out of the 125 countries ranked, but nevertheless disappointing given America’s freedom heritage. Here, as in so many areas, the U.S. is losing its position as the global leader in promoting individual liberty and limited government.



Property rights always have been important. Barun S. Mitra, head of India’s Liberty Institute, who wrote the foreword to the latest IPRI ratings, observes that “A modern economy is built on clear ownership of property whether tangible or intangible — be it land, shares, or intellectual property.” Property rights promote justice, allowing people at all economic strata to enjoy the fruit of their labor. More important from the economic standpoint, property rights create an extraordinarily powerful incentive to raise and use resources productively and efficiently.



Alas, the challenge to economic freedom has grown in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Notes Kelsey Zahourek, the PRA’s executive director, “many people across the globe are continuing to see their basic property rights stripped away from them in the shadow of a global economic crisis.”



No surprise, the greatest challenge faces the poorest nations. Writes Mitra:



While world attention is focused on the economic situation in the U.S. and other developed countries, the situation also underscores the perpetual economic crisis in many developing nations and poor communities. In these societies, recognition of property rights and respect for ownership are weak, and a title document is often non‐​existent. Typically, these are places where informal economic activities dominate. But the consequences are very similar in both — lack of credit. Ironically, the problem of the poor is not that they do not have assets; instead, they are unable to effectively to capitalize their assets. The present crisis demonstrates that the rich are equally vulnerable to being unable to capitalize their assets if they lose their connection to the real economy and the clear titles that it requires.



Protecting property rights take many forms. One aspect is the legal and political environment. At issue are judicial independence, rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Notes the PRA report: “Even the most comprehensive _de jure_ property rights cannot be enforced unless a strong rule of law and independent judiciary are present to enforce them.” Political instability and corruption make it harder to acquire and preserve private property, and to benefit from using and improving private property. These factors typically are most lacking in poor Third World states.



Defending physical property rights is one leg of the property stool. One aspect is the strength of independent institutions, most notably the judiciary, standing against attempts to seize private assets. Other aspects include the ease of registering property and borrowing money. Explains the PRA: “access to a bank loan without collateral serves as a proxy for the level of development of financial institutions in a country.”



Another, increasingly important aspect of property is intellectual property rights. Today, with economies increasingly dependent on information and other new technologies, intellectual property is an increasingly important aspect of economic growth and prosperity. IPRI looks at both _de jure_ and _de facto_ protection for intellectual property, as well as strength of patent law and level of copyright piracy.



Useful information about many countries is lacking, which limits the number of states covered by IPRI (such as Haiti, which is absent). However, the 125 nations listed account for 97 percent of global GDP. And the rankings, if not exact, are broadly accurate in assessing national commitments to stronger property rights regimes.



The best performers are the Scandinavian states. Although these governments typically spend more than Washington, they also often regulate with a lighter, more efficient, and less corrupt hand.



In the case of property they tend to be far more protective of individual liberty. The top ten are Finland (number one for the fourth year in a row), Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, and Austria. No surprise, all of these nations enjoy productive and prosperous economies.



At the bottom are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Bolivia, Burundi, Chad, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Ivory Coast, and Bangladesh. Obviously, much is wrong with these nations, as well as others that rank poorly on the IPRI. However, unless they are able to remedy their flawed property rights regimes, they are unlikely to successfully develop even if they meet their other challenges — end external wars, pacify internal conflicts, overturn dictatorships, and so on.



North America is the freest region. Western Europe is the second. The Mideast and Asia are roughly tied for third‐​fourth. Eastern Europe/​Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa trail.



The U.S. is only number 15 overall but ties for first regarding IP. America is number 18 on legal/​political environment and ties for 11 on physical property. The U.S. did improve overall slightly from 2009 to 2010, though little substantive changed much.



While the relationship is not perfect, nations in the top IPRI quintiles do far better economically than those in the bottom quintiles. Although most countries which protect physical property also promote intellectual property, there are differences of emphasis.



Overall, nations in the top IPRI quintile enjoy an average per capita income of $35,676. The average for the second quintile is $20,087. The third comes in at $9,375. Countries in the fourth quintile have an average of $4,699 while those in the fifth fall in at $4,437. The report includes tables matching IPRI score and per capita GDP. Again, while the relationship between freedom and prosperity is not perfect, it is strongly positive.



Positive IPRI scores relate positively to other economic factors, such as foreign direct investment inflows and GDP growth. The poorest countries are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of economic statism. Wealthy, industrialized nations tend to have a free and prosperous heritage upon which they can rely. Third World states have no such advantage.



The report includes a number of specific case studies. One of the saddest is Venezuela, where all liberties, including private property protections, are under assault. Notes PRA:



“Commencing in 2001 with a set of decree‐​laws (i.e., executive orders with value and rank of laws) such as the one on Agrarian Reform …, a new trend began in Venezuela to ignore private property rights protected by article 115 of the 1999 Constitution. Moreover, with the takeover of a significant number of private agrarian lands starting in 2005, such a trend has become a State policy. The government’s strategy of systematically denying the existence of private property in different areas reached its highest manifestation with the enactment of new decree‐​laws in 2008 and recent legislation passed in 2009 by the National Assembly.



The result has been tragic for Venezuelan democracy as well as Venezuelan prosperity.



The report also notes how better property rights can promote non‐​economic ends, such as environmentalism. The study observes the World Bank “found that weak IP regimes were another form of [non‐​tariff barrier] undermining the transfer of climate friendly technologies.”



Moreover, better protection of property rights is essential for gender equality. Poor countries tend to do worse on protecting women’s property rights just as they do worse on protecting property rights generally. Of particular importance are women’s access to credit, land, and other property, as well as inheritance practices and social rights. In Uganda, for instance, “Despite the importance of land to women, the overriding feature of their relationship to land is insecure tenure.”



All countries could do better. Even Finland, notes the PRA: “The one area in which Finland needs to make progress is in [intellectual property rights], specifically copyright protection. Pirated material in business software is estimated to account for over 25 percent of the business software on the market.” The U.S. has further to go. The opportunities for improvement are modest, but nevertheless real.



Liberty is good. Milton Friedman was right: the most important justification for freedom is moral. But efficiency matters too. And protecting property rights is a critical basis of an efficient, productive, and innovative economy. Governments of rich and poor nations alike need to finally learn this lesson.

NOAA have just about finalised their numbers for the 2011 tornado season, although December figures still await confirmation.
It usually takes about three months to confirm the provisional reports as each tornado report has to be physically assessed by NWS personnel, in order to determine the category and, in many cases, even decide whether a tornado has actually occurred.

So let’s take a look at the figures, as they stand currently.

Tornado Occurrences By Category
(The F-Scale was replaced by the EF-Scale in 2007)
Historical Trends
When observing long term trends, it is important to remember that considerable changes have been made to the way that tornadoes are reported. NOAA have this to say :-
Improved tornado observation practices have led to an increase in the number of reported weaker tornadoes, and in recent years the number of EF0 and EF1 tornadoes have become more prevalent in the total number of reported tornadoes.
With increased national Doppler radar coverage [introduced between 1992 and 1997], increasing population, and greater attention to tornado reporting, there has been an increase in the number of tornado reports over the past several decades. This can create a misleading appearance of an increasing trend in tornado frequency. To better understand the true variability and trend in tornado frequency in the U.S., the total number of strong to violent tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed. These are the tornadoes that would have likely been reported even during the decades before Doppler radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports. The bar chart below indicates there has been little trend in the frequency of the strongest tornadoes over the past 55 years.
Figure 2

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadoes.html
The effect of changes in observation can be clearly seen when looking at the ratio of the weakest F0 tornadoes to total numbers back to 1950, which rises from 10% to 60%.

US Tornadoes Per Year
When the weaker tornadoes are excluded, it is clear that there is very little trend since the 1980’s. It is also very apparent that tornado occurrences were much higher in all categories of F2 and above during the 1970’s, than in the decades since.
Even in 2011, the total of F2+ tornadoes, which amounted to 279, was only slightly above the average of 255 for the whole 1970-79 period.
Are Tornadoes Becoming More Extreme?
In overall terms, Figure 2 indicates that for F3+ categories, 2011 ranked only 6th worst since 1950. But is there any trend towards the most severe categories?
Figure 5

Figure 5 shows the number of F2+ tornadoes by category for each year since 2002 expressed as a percentage of the total of F2 to F5 occurrences. The dotted lines are the averages for the 1970’s. Although 2011 experienced a sharp increase in F3, F4 and F5’s, the pattern over the 10 years as a whole does not seem to indicate any real trend, simply going up and down around the historical averages.
Conclusions
Whilst nobody can predict what 2012 will bring, there fortunately seems to be no evidence to suggest that there is any trend towards an increase in numbers or severity of tornadoes in the US.
Notes
1) The F-scale (Fujita) was uprated to the EF-scale (Enhanced Fujita) in 2007. The intent at the time was that the new scale should be consistent with the old one, and that, therefore, previous years would not be “revalued”. (More on the change here.) Please excuse me then, when I use both terminologies at different times!
2) All tornado statistics have been sourced from the Storm Prediction Centre.

"**Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT.**
First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases.
Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"".
Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut.
Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates.
Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November.
Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter.
The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"".
Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector.
""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another.""
The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added.
The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality within level three areas in Scotland.
However the rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place.
The decision will be reviewed on 17 December.
Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close.
Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed.
The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week.
The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants.
""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea.
Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants.
""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said.
Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"".
""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"".
Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that.""
""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes.""
Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties.
She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade.""
""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are.""
Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"".
""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year.""
Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business.
A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules.
""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous.
""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said.
The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell.
""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said.
""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time.""
BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford.
A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission.
Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November.
Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"".
According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales.
Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover.""
Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown.
""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said.
Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"".
The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000.
The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support.
A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses.
The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000.
The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before.
But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders.
Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to.
Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual.
Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade.
The money they are getting from the Welsh Government might well pay overheads like rent and insurance but these are businesses that have already taken a huge hit this year."
"Ever since the issue was highlighted in shows like “Blue Planet 2”, plastic pollution in the world’s oceans has generated a wave of concern among the public. It might surprise people to learn that despite comparably less attention, many of the world’s rivers are just as polluted, if not more so. Around 80% of marine litter starts on land and rivers help transport it out to sea. In this way, plastic pollution is not just a problem for the distant open ocean – it’s an issue on our doorstep. For this reason, I chose to focus on the River Thames and the impact that plastics are having close to home. There are currently no estimates for the amount of plastic in the Thames, but the world’s rivers are estimated to carry up to 4,000 kg of plastic out to sea every day. Despite much of the plastic in the Thames making it to the North Sea, a portion is permanently accumulating in the catchment. Researchers recovered nearly 8,500 items from the Thames riverbed over three months in 2012. After 20 river cleans on the foreshore of the Thames in 2019, nearly 9,000 plastic items were recovered, almost all of which were single-use. These were most often wet wipes, sanitary products and food packaging, which accumulate in the sediment or are deposited on the inside of bends in the river. Several members of our lab group helped with a cleanup with local environment charity Thames21. On the Thames foreshore at Hammersmith in early 2019, 23,000 wipes were collected, averaging 201 wipes per square metre. You may have heard of wet wipes forming “fatbergs” in sewers, but on the banks of the Thames there are wet wipe reefs that are slowly changing the shape of the river itself. As plastics move through the aquatic environment they break up. Eventually, these particles reach a microscopic scale. I have been researching microplastics, which are items smaller than 5 mm – roughly  the size of a grain of rice – since 2015 and every study I have undertaken has found plastic. I have studied two UK rivers, the Thames and the Clyde, and fish in both estuaries have ingested plastic. As part of my PhD, I’m researching the accumulation of microplastics in the Thames food web. When I trawl in the Thames for fish the nets are full of plastic, especially tangles of wet wipes. It’s extremely rare that we bring in a net with no litter at all. Despite its murky appearance, the Thames is a diverse ecosystem that’s full of life. It supports over 120 species of fish as well as many marine mammals, such as grey seals, common seals, dolphins and porpoises. Even a beluga whale was once spotted. Microplastics in the river can be ingested by all animals in the food web. Negative impacts on one part of this system can potentially cause a cascade which affects other species.  Microplastics contain chemical additives which are released as they degrade and can act as harmful pollutants in water. These toxic chemicals can be transferred to organisms if they ingest them. This forces the animal to use their energy to treat the problem, rather than growing, feeding or reproducing. The amount of plastic in an animal’s gut is likely to increase higher up the food web that the animal feeds. If amphipods near the base of the foodweb ingest a few pieces of plastic then fish eating large numbers of amphipods – each likely to contain small amounts of plastic – would gradually accumulate more as they feed. Then seals at the top of the foodweb, which ingest lots of fish, would be exposed to a greater concentration still. Though plastic straws and other single-use items have taken much of the blame, the plastic most commonly eaten by flatfish – a species often caught by fishers – are fibres. These are long threads of plastic which originate in our fabrics. Straws may flow out to sea quicker but during my research in the Thames, I found that 80% of all plastic extracted from animals there were fibres. Hundreds of thousands of these tiny plastic fibres can drain into rivers with every use of our washing machines. Wastewater treatment plants catch the majority of these fibres, but with so many people washing their clothes in the Thames catchment area, a vast number of fibres are still entering the river and making their way out to sea.  Washing clothes less often and using products designed to capture fibres in the wash can prevent them getting to rivers or the sea, such as the guppy friend bag and coraball. We may rightly fret about the impact of our plastic on life in the ocean, but it’s time we realised that the plastic pollution crisis is a lot closer to home than we care to think."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe strategy of scaring people into action on climate change has backfired totally, so writes Kathrin Burger of the German leftist TAZ daily in a piece titled: Horror Scenarios Promote Depression.

Psychologists say that many who have been listening excessively to climate alarmists are now ready for therapy. Photo: public domain – Marc NL 
It turns out the alarmists, with all their climate doom and gloom, have only succeeded in spreading depression among themsleves and those around them.
It’s only normal that people who surround themselves with incurable pessimists also eventually become pessimistic themselves, and eventually get depressed or mentally ill. This is what’s happening within the climate movement in Germany, enviro-psychologists say.
Alarmism as a mental disorder
It can be convincingly argued that mental illness is indeed a chronic problem among many climate alarmists and their followers. Many are paranoid that a trace gas is causing a climate catastrophe. They even blame bad weather on the Co2 trace gas, with some even going so far as to blame earthquakes and war on the man-made CO2 molecules in the air. Seemingly educated scientists are obsessed with a coming climate catastrophe to the point where they even refuse to believe any data showing to the contrary.
And now that many western societies have been exposed to climate pessimism and alarmism for a good 25 years, it’s little wonder we are finding reports confirming that all the climate doom-saying is causing more depression globally, so writes the German leftist online TAZ. The problem with the environmental movement, experts are finding out, is that it is making everybody mentally sick and depressed rather than making them more environmentally aware and responsible. People are becoming complacent when it comes to climate-related action.
“Doomer Depression”
In the TAZ article, author Kathrin Burger admits that all the fear-mongering indeed has been a very poor method of motivating people to change their lives:
Florian Kaiser, environmental psychologist at the University of Magdeburg says: ‘With threatening scenarios you’ll likely not get anyone to change their views.'”
The TAZ writes that all the scare scenarios are in fact leading to a phenomenon dubbed: “Doomer Depression“.
The TAZ, of course, takes the position that the planet is in big trouble, and that this message needs to be communicated in a new way – in a way that makes the message less depressing and more effective at motivating people to change their lives. Nowhere does the TAZ write that the alarmism itself may have its very roots in mental disorder, i.e. the CO2 paranoia and obsession mentioned above.
Here’s an excerpt of what the TAZ claims:
One problem is that climate change is hardly detectable and so people have a psychological distance to it. Apocalyptic scenarios are, however, of little help in overcoming that distance. The overly drastic prognoses that were used especially in the 1980s only amplified the sense of helplessness. ‘Because stability is a fundamental desire of every person, thoughts that have to do with situations of collapse often get suppressed,’ states a strategy paper of the Greens in Saxony.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The TAZ writes that communicating the message that climate change is real and that humans need to accept drastic lifestyle changes remains a major challenge for the movement. Many people just are not reacting to it.
People are not responding to the message
The real challenge is to find a way to shape people’s perception so that they do embrace the message communicated by the environmental cause. Psychologist Kaiser is quoted by the TAZ as saying:
Pro-social people, those who are inclined to help others, are more accessible for ecological argumentation and are thus more open to dedicating themselves to the environment. However, those who do not count themselves as being among the altruistic are very difficult to reach.”
From the social engineers’ point of view, the problem lies with the human raw material that they have to deal with. The movement would be far easier if only everyone had the right mindset and political view from the start. Consequently many believe that the place to start is to shape the young minds of schoolchildren at an early stage.
School indoctrination has failed
One strategy used by social engineering experts is the indoctrination of children at schools…the farms for growing future environmentalists. Germany for example has attempted in schools for 25 years to indoctrinate its children to become more environmentally aware and responsible. For the results of that experiment, the TAZ quotes Ulrich Gebhardt, child development researcher at the University of Hamburg (emphasis added):
After 25 years of environmental education at schools, the conclusion is sobering: ‘Education for sustainable development‘ has had no effect.'”
And all this time we thought schools were for teaching things like reading, writing, and mathematics. For once in my life I’m glad that schools have, in a way, failed. If anything, this shows that parents are by far the most important force in bringing up children. Good news.
Alarmists Anonymous
So if horror scenarios and indoctrination are failing to motivate people into action and are only causing the side effect of people getting depressed, what strategy is now being pursued in Germany to combat the environmental movement’s side effects, i.e. depression and complacency?
Rather than re-examining the climate data and concluding there really isn’t an imminent catastrophe coming, the alarmists still continue to insist it’s real and are now coming together to produce “positive visions” in group therapy – a sort of Alarmists Anonymous. The TAZ quotes psychologist Gerd Weßling of the Transition Town Bielefeld:
The inner and outer transition depend on each other. In this initiative it’s about meeting on a regular basis, often with psychologists, where the members have the chance to express their desperation and hopelessness.”
For the rest of us who have avoided the doom of gloom of the climate alarmism, my advice is that you continue doing so. Visiting skeptic sites like this one will keep you optimistic about the future and a lot happier.

From NASA Goddard, Jim Hansen reports on his balance problem:
Earth’s Energy Budget Remained Out of Balance Despite Unusually Low Solar Activity

A prolonged solar minimum left the sun's surface nearly free of sunspots and accompanying bright areas called faculae between 2005 and 2010. Total solar irradiance declined slightly as a result, but the Earth continued to absorb more energy than it emit throughout the minimum. An animation of a full solar cycle is available here. Credit: NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio
A new NASA study underscores the fact that greenhouse gases generated by human activity — not changes in solar activity — are the primary force driving global warming.
The study offers an updated calculation of the Earth’s energy imbalance, the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth’s surface and the amount returned to space as heat. The researchers’ calculations show that, despite unusually low solar activity between 2005 and 2010, the planet continued to absorb more energy than it returned to space.
James Hansen, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City, led the research. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics published the study last December.
Total solar irradiance, the amount of energy produced by the sun that reaches the top of each square meter of the Earth’s atmosphere, typically declines by about a tenth of a percent during cyclical lulls in solar activity caused by shifts in the sun’s magnetic field. Usually solar minimums occur about every eleven years and last a year or so, but the most recent minimum persisted more than two years longer than normal, making it the longest minimum recorded during the satellite era.
A graph of the sun's total solar irradiance shows that in recent years irradiance dipped to the lowest levels recorded during the satellite era. The resulting reduction in the amount of solar energy available to affect Earth's climate was about .25 watts per square meter, less than half of Earth's total energy imbalance. (Credit: NASA/James Hansen)
Pinpointing the magnitude of Earth’s energy imbalance is fundamental to climate science because it offers a direct measure of the state of the climate. Energy imbalance calculations also serve as the foundation for projections of future climate change. If the imbalance is positive and more energy enters the system than exits, Earth grows warmer. If the imbalance is negative, the planet grows cooler.
Hansen’s team concluded that Earth has absorbed more than half a watt more solar energy per square meter than it let off throughout the six year study period. The calculated value of the imbalance (0.58 watts of excess energy per square meter) is more than twice as much as the reduction in the amount of solar energy supplied to the planet between maximum and minimum solar activity (0.25 watts per square meter).
“The fact that we still see a positive imbalance despite the prolonged solar minimum isn’t a surprise given what we’ve learned about the climate system, but it’s worth noting because this provides unequivocal evidence that the sun is not the dominant driver of global warming,” Hansen said.
According to calculations conducted by Hansen and his colleagues, the 0.58 watts per square meter imbalance implies that carbon dioxide levels need to be reduced to about 350 parts per million to restore the energy budget to equilibrium. The most recent measurements show that carbon dioxide levels are currently 392 parts per million and scientists expect that concentration to continue to rise in the future.
Climate scientists have been refining calculations of the Earth’s energy imbalance for many years, but this newest estimate is an improvement over previous attempts because the scientists had access to better measurements of ocean temperature than researchers have had in the past.
The improved measurements came from free-floating instruments that directly monitor the temperature, pressure and salinity of the upper ocean to a depth of 2,000 meters (6,560 feet). The network of instruments, known collectively as Argo, has grown dramatically in recent years since researchers first began deploying the floats a decade ago. Today, more than 3,400 Argo floats actively take measurements and provide data to the public, mostly within 24 hours.
Data collected by Argo floats, such as this one, helped Hansen's team improve the calculation of Earth's energy imbalance. Credit: Argo Project Office
Hansen’s analysis of the information collected by Argo, along with other ground-based and satellite data, show the upper ocean has absorbed 71 percent of the excess energy and the Southern Ocean, where there are few Argo floats, has absorbed 12 percent. The abyssal zone of the ocean, between about 3,000 and 6,000 meters (9,800 and 20,000 feet) below the surface, absorbed five percent, while ice absorbed eight percent and land four percent.
The updated energy imbalance calculation has important implications for climate modeling. Its value, which is slightly lower than previous estimates, suggests that most climate models overestimate how readily heat mixes deeply into the ocean and significantly underestimates the cooling effect of small airborne particles called aerosols, which along with greenhouse gases and solar irradiance are critical factors in energy imbalance calculations.
“Climate models simulate observed changes in global temperatures quite accurately, so if the models mix heat into the deep ocean too aggressively, it follows that they underestimate the magnitude of the aerosol cooling effect,” Hansen said.
Aerosols, which can either warm or cool the atmosphere depending on their composition and how they interact with clouds, are thought to have a net cooling effect. But estimates of their overall impact on climate are quite uncertain given how difficult it is to measure the distribution of the particles on a broad scale. The new study suggests that the overall cooling effect from aerosols could be about twice as strong as current climate models suggest, largely because few models account for how the particles affect clouds.

“Unfortunately, aerosols remain poorly measured from space,” said Michael Mishchenko, a scientist also based at GISS and the project scientist for Glory, a satellite mission designed to measure aerosols in unprecedented detail that was lost after a launch failure in early 2011. “We must have a much better understanding of the global distribution of detailed aerosol properties in order to perfect calculations of Earth’s energy imbalance,” said Mishchenko.

By Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
Responses to my post of December 28 about climate sensitivity have been particularly interesting. This further posting answers some of the feedback.
My earlier posting explained how the textbooks establish that if albedo and insolation were held constant but all greenhouse gases were removed from the air the Earth’s surface temperature would be 255 K. Since today’s temperature is 288 K, the presence as opposed to absence of all the greenhouse gases – including H2O, CO2, CH4, N2O and stratospheric O3 – causes 33 K warming.

Kiehl and Trenberth say that the interval of total forcing from the five main greenhouse gases is 101[86, 125] Watts per square meter. Since just about all temperature feedbacks since the dawn of the Earth have acted by now, the post-feedback or equilibrium system climate sensitivity parameter is 33 K divided by the forcing interval – namely 0.33[0.27, 0.39] Kelvin per Watt per square meter.
Multiplying the system sensitivity parameter interval by any given radiative forcing yields the corresponding equilibrium temperature change. The IPCC takes the forcing from a doubling of CO2 concentration as 3.7 Watts per square meter, so the corresponding warming – the system climate sensitivity – is 1.2[1.0, 1.4] K, or about one-third of the IPCC’s 3.3[2.0, 4.5] K.
I also demonstrated that the officially-estimated 2 Watts per square meter of radiative forcings and consequent manmade temperature changes of 0.4-0.8 K since 1750 indicated a transient industrial-era sensitivity of 1.1[0.7, 1.5] K, very much in line with the independently-determined system sensitivity.
Accordingly. transient and equilibrium sensitivities are so close to one another that temperature feedbacks – additional forcings that arise purely because temperature has changed in response to initial or base forcings – are very likely to be net-zero.
Indeed, with net-zero feedbacks the IPCC’s transient-sensitivity parameter is 0.31 Kelvin per Watt per square meter, close to the 0.33 that I had derived as the system equilibrium or post-feedback parameter.
I concluded that climate sensitivity to the doubling of CO2 concentration expected this century is low enough to be harmless.
One regular troll – one can tell he is a troll by his silly hate-speech about how I “continue to fool yourself and others” – attempted to say that Kiehl and Trenberth’s 86-125 Watts per square meter of total forcing from the presence of the top five greenhouse gases included the feedbacks consequent upon the forcing, asserting, without evidence, that I (and by implication the two authors) was confusing forcings and feedbacks.
No: Kiehl and Trenberth are quite specific in their paper: “We calculate the longwave radiative forcing of a given gas by sequentially removing atmospheric absorbers from the radiation model. We perform these calculations for clear and cloudy sky conditions to illustrate the role of clouds to a given absorber for the total radiative forcing. Table 3 lists the individual contribution of each absorber to the total clear-sky [and cloudy-sky] radiative forcing.” Forcing, not feedback. Indeed, the word “feedback” does not occur even once in Kiehl & Trenberth’s paper.
In particular, the troll thought we were treating the water-vapor feedback as though it were a forcing. We were not, of course, but let us pretend for a moment that we were. If we now add CO2 to the atmospheric mix and disturb what the IPCC assumes to have been a prior climatic equilibrium, then by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation the space occupied by the atmosphere is capable of holding near-exponentially more water vapor as it warms. This – to the extent that it occurred – would indeed be a feedback.
However, as Paltridge et al. (2009) have demonstrated, it is not clear that the water vapor feedback is anything like as strongly positive as the IPCC would like us to believe. Below the mid-troposphere, additional water vapor makes very little difference because its principal absorption bands are largely saturated. Above it, the additional water vapor tends to subside harmlessly to lower altitudes, again making very little difference to temperature. The authors conclude that feedbacks are somewhat net-negative, a conclusion supported by measurements given in papers such as Lindzen & Choi (2009, 2010), Spencer & Braswell (2010, 2011), and Shaviv (2011).
It is also worth recalling that Solomon et al. (2009) say equilibrium will not be reached for up to 3000 years after we perturb the climate. If so, it is only the transient climate change (one-third of the IPCC’s ’quilibrium estimate) that will occur in our lifetime and in that of our grandchildren. Whichever way you stack it, manmade warming in our own era will be small and, therefore, harmless.
A true-believer at the recent Los Alamos quinquennial climate conference at Santa Fe asked me, in a horrified voice, whether I was really willing to allow our grandchildren to pay for the consequences of our folly in emitting so much CO2. Since the warming we shall cause will be small and may well prove to be beneficial, one hopes future generations will be grateful to us.
Besides, as President Klaus of the Czech Republic has wisely pointed out, if we damage our grandchildren’s inheritance by blowing it on useless windmills, mercury-filled light-bulbs, solar panels, and a gallimaufry of suchlike costly, wasteful, environment-destroying fashion statements, our heirs will certainly not thank us.
Mr. Wingo and others wonder whether it is appropriate to assume that the sum of various different fourth powers of temperature over the entire surface of the Earth will be equal to the fourth power of the global temperature as determined by the fundamental equation of radiative transfer. By zonal calculation on several hundred zones of equal height and hence of equal spherical-surface area, making due allowance for the solar azimuth angle applicable to each zone, I have determined that the equation does indeed provide a very-nearly-accurate mean surface temperature, varying from the sum of the zonal means by just 0.5 K in total. In mathematical terms, the Holder inequality is in this instance near-vanishingly small.
Dr. Nikolov, however, considers that the textbooks and the literature are wrong in this respect: but I have deliberately confined my analysis to textbook methods and “mainstream-science” data precisely so as to minimize the scope for any disagreement on the part of those who – until now – have gone along with the IPCC’s assertion that climate sensitivity is high enough to be dangerous. Deploying their own methods and drawing proper conclusions from them is more likely to lead them to rethink their position than attempting to reinvent the wheel.
Mr. Martin asks whether I’d be willing to apply my calculations to Venus. However, I do not share the view of Al Gore, Dr. Nikolov, or Mr. Huffman that Venus is likely to give us the answers we need about climate sensitivity on Earth. A brief critique of Mr. Huffman’s analysis of the Venusian atmospheric soup and its implications for climate sensitivity is at Jo Nova’s ever-fragrant and always-eloquent website.
Brian H asks whether Dr. Nikolov is right in his finding that, for several astronomical bodies [including Venus] all that matters in the determination of surface temperature is the mass of the atmospheric overburden. Since I am not yet content that Dr. Nikolov is right in concluding that the Earth’s characteristic-emission temperature is 100 K less than the 255 K given in the textbooks, I am disinclined to enquire further into his theory until this rather large discrepancy is resolved.
Rosco is surprised by the notion of dividing the incoming solar irradiance by 4 to determine the Wattage per square meter of the Earth’s surface. I have taken this textbook step because the Earth intercepts a disk-sized area of insolation, which must be distributed over the rotating spherical surface, and the ratio of the surface area of a disk to that of a sphere of equal radius is 1:4.
Other commenters have asked whether the fact that the characteristic-emission sphere has a greater surface area than the Earth makes a difference. No, it doesn’t, because the ratio of the surface areas of disk and sphere is 1:4 regardless of the radius and hence surface area of the sphere.
Rosco also cites Kiehl and Trenberth’s notion that the radiation absorbed and emitted at the Earth’s surface is 390 Watts per square meter. The two authors indicate, in effect, that they derived that value by multiplying the fourth power of the Earth’s mean surface temperature of 288 K by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (0.0000000567 Watts per square meter per Kelvin to the fourth power).
If Kiehl & Trenberth were right to assume that a strict Stefan-Boltzmann relation holds at the surface in this way, then we might legitimately point out that the pre-feedback climate-sensitivity parameter – the first differential of the fundamental equation of radiative transfer at the above values for surface radiative flux and temperature – would be just 288/(390 x 4) = 0.18 Kelvin per Watt per square meter. If so, even if we were to assume the IPCC’s implicit central estimate of strongly net-positive feedbacks at 2.1 Watts per square meter per Kelvin the equilibrium climate sensitivity to a CO2 doubling would be 3.7 x 0.18 / (1 – 2.1 x 0.18) = 1.1 K. And where have we seen that value before?
In all this, of course, I do not warrant any of the IPCC’s or Kiehl and Trenberth’s or the textbooks’ methods or data or results as correct: that would be well above my pay-grade. However, as Mr. Fernley-Jones has correctly noticed, I am quite happy to demonstrate that if their methods and values are correct then climate sensitivity – whichever way one does the calculation – is about one-third of what they would like us to believe it is.
All the contributors – even the trolls – have greatly helped me in clarifying what is in essence a simple but not simpliste argument. To those who have wanted to complicate the argument in various ways, I say that, as the splendid Willis Eschenbach has pointed out before in this column, one should keep firmly in mind the distinction between first-order effects that definitely change the outcome, second-order effects that may or may not change it but won’t change it much, and third-order effects that definitely won’t change it enough to make a difference. One should ruthlessly exclude third-order effects, however superficially interesting.
Given that the IPCC seems to be exaggerating climate sensitivity threefold, only the largest first-order influences are going to make a significant difference to the calculation. And it is the official or textbook treatment of these influences that I have used throughout.
My New Year’s resolution is to write a short book about the climate question, in which the outcome of the discussions here will be presented. The book will say that climate sensitivity is low; that, even if it were as high as the IPCC wants us to think, it would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper to adapt to the consequences of any warming that may occur than to try, Canute-like, to prevent it; that there are multiple lines of evidence for systematic and connected corruption and fraud on the part of the surprisingly small clique of politically-motivated “scientists” who have fabricated and driven the now-failing climate scare; and that too many who ought to know better have looked the other way as their academic, scientific, political, or journalistic colleagues have perpetrated and perpetuated their shoddy frauds, because silence in the face of official mendacity is socially convenient, politically expedient, and, above all, financially profitable.
The final chapter will add that there is a real danger that the UN, using advisors from the European Union, will succeed in exploiting the fraudulent science peddled by the climate/environment axis as a Trojan horse to extinguish democracy in those countries which, unlike the nations of Europe, are still fortunate enough to have it; that the world’s freedom is consequently at immediate and grave risk from the vaunting ambition of a grasping, talent-free, scientifically-illiterate ruling elite of world-government wannabes everywhere; but that – as the recent history of the bureaucratic-centralist and now-failed EU has demonstrated – the power-mad adidacts are doomed, and they will be brought low by the ineluctable futility of their attempts to tinker with the laws of physics and of economics.
The army of light and truth, however few we be, will quietly triumph over the forces of darkness in the end: for, whether they like it or not, the unalterable truth cannot indefinitely be confused, concealed, or contradicted. We did not make the laws of science: therefore, it is beyond our power to repeal them.

This post over on Scottish Sceptic’s website (below) points to a problem that WUWT has with search engines. One big issue he raises is that I can’t edit meta tags in the website header, but then again, I’ve had a clue that hasn’t mattered for a couple of years now, from the WordPress forum:
It’s not possible to edit meta tags on WordPress.com blogs.
…
Moreover Google does not use the keywords meta tag in web ranking – Monday, September 21, 2009

WUWT – page 35 when searching for “global warming”
Posted on November 9, 2011 by Scottish Sceptic
Following some comments on WUWT about the “+1″ scheme to boost ratings, I first joined the scheme, then decided to do it the old fashioned way and click on the WUWT link when searching for “global warming”.
So, imagine my surprise when I found WUWT on …
PAGE 35
Yes, that is right! WUWT was on page 35 … I had to double check to make sure it was right because it was behind the GWPF, behind climate audit, behind unrealclimate, behind the IPCC behind sites that none of us have ever heard of.

So, why was it on page 35 of the google results?
Why having clicked on it just once, did it move (via another PC on another URL) to page 34?
And, why when I checked the page, was there not a single meta-tag telling the google search engine this site had anything or wanted anything to do with global warming?

The simple answer given the ease by which I escalated the ranking by a single click is that no one ever clicks on a WUWT page when they search for global warming. And before everyone starts point to google bias, obviously, no one trusts the top ranking sites (they are mostly paid for … or promoted due to google’s own politics) but whilst it is quite possible WUWT has a lower ranking than it should, I think there is much more to this and quite a lot has nothing to do with Google and so I have a few suggestions:

I have to be honest, and say that I don’t think Anthony Watts has a clue about publicising his site particularly for search engines. E.g. he doesn’t even mention global warming as a search term in the meta tabs telling search engines which words and phrases characterise the site. That just screams out that he doesn’t exactly make his site google friendly and it’s not surprising that it is so lowly rated.
Sceptics most probably do not use Google to find the site. If we don’t search on google, how is google supposed to know that people want to find that site when they search?
And yes, Google hates WUWT … and more than likely is actively trying to repress the site. OK, we have to accept that, so we have to work together to try to reverse this.

What can be done
1. Search for global warming and click on the WUWT site.
Go to google and enter “global warming”. Then click the last number at the bottom to go to pages 10, then 19, etc. until you reach page 35 3435.
(Addendum: the next WUWT page is around page 70 of google results!!)
Then start going backwards until you find an entry for any page linked to wattsupwiththat.com and then click it.
Repeat prescription every day!
2. Add a link to wattsupwiththat.com
Where ever and when ever add a link.
3. Join the “+1 scheme“
Join the scheme and then find the WUWT pages and press the +1 button
==================================================================
He makes some good points that would make a good new year’s resolution – help spread the word. There is one thing I can do, and that is make a change to the header image to remove the masthead statement and place it into the first lines of text. I’ve made that change today to see if it helps.
As always, my sincerest thanks in advance to everyone who helps support this website in words and deeds.

"In Aesop’s fable of the boy who cried wolf, the boy warns farmers of imaginary wolves threatening their flocks just to laugh at the sight of them running to the rescue for no reason. Of course, when the real wolf comes no one believes his cries – the moral of the story being that nobody believes a liar, even when he tells the truth. There are some species in nature that also cry wolf, but they are much more clever about it than the boy in the fable. A new study published in the journal Science has shown how a species of African birds called fork-tailed drongos will cry wolf in a bid to steal a free lunch from those they alarm. They wait for an unsuspecting pied babbler or meerkat to find an especially tasty morsel such as a lizard or cricket. Then the drongo screams blue murder and, as the terrified animal runs for cover, swoops in and nabs the abandoned meal. This system relies on the fact that drongos also sound the alarm when predators actually are present. In fact they act as sentinels, perching high up in the trees and scanning for danger – predators such as foxes, mongooses, and especially raptors such as goshawks – and will quickly call an alarm before diving for cover themselves. Meerkats and other birds, such as babblers and starlings, also produce alarm calls, and since they share many predators each pays attention to the warnings given by the other. Cross-species alarm calls use is actually quite common in the avian world because a bird that eavesdrops on others’ alarm calls could gain critical, potentially life saving information about predators. For example, members of a species I’ve worked on in North America, called chickadees, are adept at spotting danger and more than 50 different species of birds are known to respond to their alarms. Australian fairy-wrens and scrub-wrens also respond to each other’s alarm calls, and recent work has demonstrated that this interspecies understanding is learned. This type of cross-species, or heterospecific, eavesdropping is not restricted to birds either. Several types of monkeys eavesdrop on each other’s alarm calls and birds called hornbills can also distinguish between primate alarm calls. Even some species of lizard – which don’t vocalize at all – can understand alarm calls relevant to them. Predators have, naturally, dramatic impacts on their prey, and it should not be a surprise that animals will use whatever means possible to avoid becoming something else’s lunch. So, while alarm calling is common, the deceptive use of alarm calls to trick eavesdroppers is much rarer. This type of behaviour was originally proposed for mixed species bird flocks in the Amazon, but fork-tailed drongos are probably the best example. But how do they avoid the fate of the boy who cried wolf in the fable, with other species becoming wise to their false alarms? Drongos have another trick up their sleeves: they pretend to be those other species.  Watching how humans or animals react to repeated stimuli is a commonly used psychological test to ascertain whether a response is habitual or whether the response is connected in some way to the context or source of the stimuli. The boy in the fable crying wolf is eventually ignored, but a cry from someone other than the boy would generate a response, because it is the source of the cry (the boy) that is relevant, rather than the cry itself. The same principle appears in groups of animals; a drongo giving repeated false alarms might soon be ignored were it not for the fact that, as a look-out, the drongo also provides warning of real threats. By mimicking the alarm calls of other species the drongo appears even more reliable.  What the researchers behind this study observed is that drongos adjust their calling behaviour depending on their audience. They are more likely to mimic the species they are targeting – if it’s a babbler they wish to steal from they produce an imitation of the babbler’s alarm, if it is a starling, they imitate the starling.       Drongos were more than twice as likely to mimic a target species’ alarm call during attempts to steal a free meal than that of other species, and when the researchers played back these mimiced calls they found babblers responded more strongly to a drongo mimicking them than to the drongo’s own alarm calls. This suggests that drongos associate each of the mimicked calls with a particular species, rather than simply treating their entire repertoire of alarm calls as the same and interchangeable.  The cunning drongo even goes one step further in this charade, keeping track of whether they have previously fooled certain individual babblers, and varying their alarm calls when attempting to fool and steal from the same individual. The researchers played back alarm calls to babblers and demonstrated that birds become habituated to false alarms, but will respond again if the type of alarm call is changed. Drongos that change their call were much more successful at getting a meal: the likelihood of stealing food from an unsuspecting babbler increased by nearly 50% compared with individuals that did not change their alarm call.  Taken together, this suggests these birds might understand the experience of babblers, indicative of sophisticated cognitive abilities; a very clever bird indeed."

On the same day that my article [Coverage of Free Speech Trial Illustrates Media Bias](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/coverage-of-free-speech-trial-illustrates-media-bias/) was published, Karl du Fresne[ ](https://karldufresne.blogspot.com/)on his blog tackled the same topic. His article had the headline [Activism disguised as journalism](https://karldufresne.blogspot.com/2019/09/activism-disguised-as-journalism.html), and it analysed the Radio NZ hit jobs against both Pregnancy Counselling Services and the Free Speech Coalition.



Radio New Zealand continues to exhibit utter contempt for its obligation of impartiality.   
[…] on the RNZ website yesterday under the headline _NZ’s right wing turn up in force for controversial free speech case_ , reporter Matthew Theunissen painted a lurid picture of “notable right-wing figures” turning up at the Auckland High Court, where the Free Speech Coalition was challenging Auckland Council’s right to deny a public speaking venue to Canadians Lauren Southern and Stephan Molyneux. 



Theunissen reported that Don Brash, “the man behind the Orewa speech”, made an appearance and Jordan Williams from the Taxpayers’ Union was listening intently in the gallery, “a few seats down from a man wearing a MAGA (Make Ardern Go Away) hat”.   
He added that “old” Conservative Party leader Colin Craig (I think Theunissen meant “former”, but hey – who expects journalists to have a command of correct English?) “poked his head around the door at one point”. 



There you have it, then: as sinister a collection of shadowy right-wing rogues and conspiratorial schemers as you could wish for. **Theunissen seemed intent on making it sound like a clandestine meeting of the Ku Klux Klan** […]  
  
Theunissen went on to describe one of the applicants appearing in support of the Free Speech Coalition’s case as “would-be Dunedin mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer […] (whose name Theunissen misspelt, but hey – who cares about getting names right when it’s the sneering tone that matters?).   
The relevance of […] views on climate change and Donald Trump wasn’t clear, but never mind; the important thing was **to convey the impression that this was a court action brought by a bunch of crazy and possibly dangerous old men.**



Even Jack Hodder QC, who represented the Free Speech Coalition, didn’t escape. Theunissen’s assiduous research had established that Hodder also acted for the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners in opposing aspects of the recent changes to the gun laws.   
No further evidence needed, then. It was left to readers of Theunissen’s piece to conclude that the disreputable figures congregating in the Auckland High Court were racists […], religious cranks […], champions of heartless free-market capitalism […] and probably white supremacists […]. Oh, and possibly gun nuts too […]. 



The unmistakeable **purpose of the article was to denigrate** those involved in the Free Speech Coalition’s case and by doing so, to discredit the court action.[…]  
RNZ followed that up […]with the results of an obviously laborious investigation (pun not deliberate) into Pregnancy Counselling Services, an organisation that offers support to pregnant women facing a choice between having an abortion or carrying their baby to full term. 



It’s no secret that PCS is loosely affiliated with Christian churches and tries to encourage women to at least consider having a baby rather than immediately taking the abortion option, so that was hardly a “stop the presses” exclusive. RNZ reporter Susan Strongman concentrated instead on portraying PCS as dishonest in the way it promotes its services and highlighting the fact that it has received modest financial support under the government’s Community Organisations Grants Schemes (Cogs). 



Trouble was, Strongman’s credibility as an impartial journalist was fatally compromised when **she was sprung collaborating with pro-abortion activist group ALRANZ.** As reported on this blog last month, Strongman used the ALRANZ Facebook page to seek information from women who had sought counselling from PCS “only to find they [the counsellors] are pushing a pro-life agenda”.[…]  
  
It’s one thing for journalists to use contacts to go on a fishing expedition for information, but another to align themselves so closely with one side of a divisive and contentious political debate, especially when the reporter is working for **a state-funded broadcaster with an obligation of neutrality.**  
Certainly, pro-life groups were convinced that Strongman was out to do a hatchet job on PCS **with the aim of cutting off an important source of funding**.   
[…] there’s no concealing the article’s partisanship. As with Theunissen’s piece on the Free Speech Coalition’s court action, it can only reinforce concerns about the increasing incidence of activism disguised as journalism, and further undermine public confidence in Radio New Zealand as an impartial source of information on matters of vital public interest.

Thousands Petition Gov. Brown To End Cap And Trade
By Amy Quinton, California Capitol Network
Californians Against Higher Taxes and business groups delivered the petitions against
what they call an illegal and hidden energy tax. The cap and trade program would
limit greenhouse gas emissions by requiring polluters to purchase pollution credits
at auction.

But John Kabateck, with the National Federation of Independent Businesses,
says it amounts to an illegal tax that would kill businesses.  “Experts say that this tax could drain 30-billion dollars from California employers by the year 2020, those costs will have to be passed onto someone and that means small business owners and consumers are going to be hit with higher prices.”
Opponents also say the program is unconstitutional without a vote
by the people or a two-thirds vote in the legislature. Assembly Speaker John Perez has said spending and regulating auction revenues doesn’t constitute a tax.

It’s difficult enough to take a cynical look at a teenage superstar and harder still when the star’s social media page simply announces a “16 year old climate activist with Aspergers”. Grappling with such disability elicits much more goodwill from the community; Greta Thunberg has become the ‘Susan Boyle of Global Warming’.



Gifted teenagers are nothing new to society in the fields of science, mathematics and literature, but in the more visible, high-publicity and high earning fields of sport and entertainment they have to be handled carefully lest the resultant fame become ruinous. Often such youngsters’ careers are handled by parents who are assumed to have the teens’ interests closest to their own hearts. While some people may be disparaging of the juvenile success stories, especially if the performance genre or physical activity is not suited to the heckler’s personal taste, they generally get a smile, a wave and a ‘good on you’ by the community at large unless thrust into the limelight by politics.



We got a dose, earlier this year, of how much slack is cut for a teenager embroiled in political shenanigans, even if thrown into the arena unintentionally, in the case of 16-year-old Nicholas Sandmann of Covington Catholic High School. His nervous grimace and every action, indeed micro-action, were thoroughly dissembled, discussed and distorted by the mob-rule media in unaffectionate (to say the least) terms. This included our very own rat-pack who excoriated the lad, abusing him, calling him the face of evil, uneducated, racist and bigoted before even attempting to grasp a simple, objective, factual view of what had transpired at the Lincoln Memorial that day. For days after the sober facts emerged, publishers in New Zealand still put the boot into the innocent young fellow like an out-of-control Jake ‘the Muss’ beating the daylight out of poor Beth. They loved it. I was disgusted.



So it with a sense of caution that I consider the political acts of Greta Thunberg, and the influence that her parents may have on her public profile.



In late June Greta walked into a recording studio to tape a message for a track on British band _1975’_ s new album. In [that message](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/time-to-rebel-greta-thunberg-makes-musical-debut-on-the-1975-track) she makes an extraordinary statement:



“We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed.”



Whatever does she mean? She follows that up with:



“So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel.”



Thunberg announced, in a tweet following the recording, that all proceeds from the piece would be donated to the far-Left ‘Extinction Rebellion’ movement, which is not nearly as controversial in New Zealand as it is in her homeland of Sweden. Doubling the indignation of her compatriots she included a photograph of herself wearing a top emblazoned with the extreme-Left ‘Antifa’ logo with the message.



The tweet provoked a storm of negative reactions. In Sweden **Antifascistisk Aktion** (or AFA) is widely known as an [out-and-out criminal organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifascistisk_Aktion) involved in much violence. Extinction Rebellion’s Swedish subsidiary is led and heavily influenced by veteran AFA member Jonathon Pye, a convicted criminal sentenced to four years jail time for his part in attacking police during the Gothenburg riots, a man who advocates violence and reportedly would not ‘rule out’ killing to further his political cause.



Greta (very responsibly) realised her mistake and deleted the message. It’s what happened next that’s the intriguing part. Responding to her chastisement ‘Greta’ issued a new tweet which seems more defiant than apologetic, calling on one hand to forgive her naivety, but on the other offering a condescending and callous retort to her detractors:



Are those the authentic words of a ’16 year old climate activist’, or someone else projecting her voice?



“ **Apparently** ” suggests young Greta is not aware of Antifascistisk Aktion’s notorious public image. Is that really credible from such a politically-engaged young lady? A search of Swedish-language newspapers throws up a deluge of stories, over 1,200 of them, more than 200 from this year so far. Are we to simply assume Greta’s gullibility in implied but innocent endorsement of the violent extreme-Left? 



“ **According to some** ” is simple condescension, as if it’s somehow in dispute, a minority view.



“ **Can be linked to violence** ” implies that a long stretch of the bow is required to come to such a conclusion, when the truth is quite the opposite.



Call me cynical, but I doubt the authenticity of the young lady’s response. Further driving my suspicion is the “expect me to know everything about a T-shirt” throwaway. I’ve had teenaged daughters, there’s not a thing of screen-printed fabric they would put on they didn’t endorse, but, at the risk of seeming mean-spirited, could I suggest Greta do what many teenagers do when attempting to understand the meaning of something beyond her years; she could simply ask her parents.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt of Die kalte Sonne site bring up an article that recently appeared in the German economics magazine: Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten (German Business News).

Logo of German economics magazine, who recently published a critical article on climate science here.
Media outlets in Europe are beginning to question all the global warming claims, especially as Central Europe reels from one of its coldest springs in living memory.
The article is dubbed: “Scientists have embarrassed themselves: climate change is not happening.”
The introduction of the report tells us:
Most climate models have falsely predicted global warming: Despite growing emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, temperatures are not rising. Snow in the winter is however a side-effect of global warming, climate scientists say.”
Have you noticed how it is getting increasingly difficult not to bust out laughing whenever “climate scientists” make statements? Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten continues:
Richard Tol of the University of Sussex said in Oslo that his impression is that temperatures have fallen over the last five years, Reuters reported.”

Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten then writes how scientists have been scrambling to explain the unexpected stop in warming, citing oceans eating up the heat or aerosols blocking out sunlight. But all this sounds rather unconvincing to Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten, which adds the following subtitle in the article:
Vertrauen in die Klima-Forschung erschüttert
Which in English translates to: “Trust in climate science has been shaken“. The online business magazine tells us:
The UN IPCC had to correct a report from the year 2007. The report had exaggerated the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, and even claimed that they could disappear completely by 2035.”
See how we’re all laughing again. So entertaining climate science has become.
But don’t let the cold fool you, Rajendra Pachauri insists. Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten writes:
Even though the IPCC admits to errors in their prognoses, says Pachauri: ‘The trend is clear.’ For the year 2016 to 2035 the IPCC projects that the temperatures will be 0.4°C to 1.0°C warmer than the two decades before 2005. Moreover, climate change may lead to rare phenomena – among them: it’ll snow more often in the wintertime, Pachauri said.”
Climate science has truly turned into comedy hour. I used to be able to read such reports in only a few minutes, but I’ve noticed I need more time lately because of all the laughing that climate scientists now generate. I don’t mind at all, though.
The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten ends its report by writing that scientists are also claiming that a growing Antarctic sea ice is also a sign of global warming – through some weird melting-ice refreezing mechanism, which everyone is still trying to figure out.
A nice piece by the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten.

Just a quick note to bring this to attention of readers. I have not been able to locate a copy of this paper other than the paywalled one at Springerlink, so I can’t comment much about it, but it looks interesting. The question is what is the mechanism? The abstract really doesn’t give a hint of that and just saying that “anomalously low solar activity” is the cause really isn’t definitive enough. – Anthony
The dynamics of solar activity and anomalous weather of summer 2010: 2. Relationship with the active longitude zone; effects in the west and east
(Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, Volume 52, Number 1, pp. 1-15, February 2012)
– K. G. Ivanov, A. F. Kharshiladze
Abstract: 
“We confirm the close synoptic relationship of the sectoral structure of the Sun’s magnetic field of the with the near-Earth tropospheric pressure with a case study of three European points (Troitsk, Rome, Jungfrau) in the period of the anomalously hot summer of June–August 2010.
We substantiate the position that such a relationship was fostered by the anomalously low solar activity as a result of superposition of the minima of the 22- and 180-year cycles. Sectoral analysis of the solar-tropospheric relationships has shown that the appearance of a blocking anticyclone in the Moscow suburbs, its expansion to Rome and Jungfrau, and subsequent retreat at first from these points, and then from the Moscow suburbs was closely related to solar activity phenomena producing, according to contemporary notions, cyclonic activity, shown by simulation of the Earth’s electric field.”
http://www.springerlink.com/content/km64487726781347/
UPDATE: Thanks to readers, I have a copy of the paper, which I forwarded to Dr. Leif Svalgaard for inspection.In the introduction of the paper there is this:
1. INTRODUCTION
More than 40 years ago, a statistically significant relationship was discovered between the sectoral struc ture of the IMF and the zonal circulation in the atmosphere of the Earth’s Northern Hemisphere; it was suggested that so-called natural synoptic periods to
some degree were determined by the structure of the interplanetary medium (Dimitriev et al., 1978). Recently it was shown that in one important particular case, the anomalously hot weather of summer 2010, a synoptic relationship took place between the sectoral
structure of the solar and interplanetary magnetic field (SMF and IMF), on the one hand, and the surface atmospheric pressure in the suburban Moscow city of Troitsk, on the other (Ivanov and Kharshiladze, 2011).
Svalgaard writes:
The Russian paper “confirms the earlier conclusions on the
reality of a relationship between the sectoral structure of the IOMFS and the Earth’s troposphere (Mansurov et al., 1974; Wilcox, 1979; Wilcox et al., 1974;… Wilcox, J.M., Svalgaard, L., and Scherrer, P.H.,
Seasonal Variation and Magnitude of the Solar Sector Structure Atmospheric VorticityEffect, Nature, 1974, vol. 55, no. 5509, pp. 539–540.
We have long since abandoned the finding as spurious.
So it seems, they are chasing an old discarded theory, and their findings may be nothing more than coincidental – Anthony

"**A Â£200,000 support package has been granted to the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society (RWAS), it has been announced.**
The RWAS organises the Royal Welsh Show, which was cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier on Monday, Steven Hughson, the chief executive of RWAS, said the organisation had lost about Â£5m this year due to events being called off.
The Welsh Government said the funding would help cover costs and help future events go ahead.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hughson said: ""The impact on us is huge, we've lost nearly 80% of all of our income this year and the events sector has been in restrictions right from the very start of this pandemic.
""Some hospitality sectors have gone in and out of restrictions, but for the events sector we've never been able to trade at all since March, April, and we continue to look forward to an uncertain 2021.""
Mr Hughson said the number of cancelled events throughout the year at the Builth Wells showground in Powys had cost the RWAS Â£5m in income and about Â£50m to the overall economy of Wales.
The Royal Welsh Show, its largest event, typically attracts about 250,000 visitors each year.
Rural affairs minister, Lesley Griffiths, said: ""I am pleased to announce a financial support package for the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society for 2020/21 reflecting the unprecedented circumstances they have faced this year.Â
""I have always said we are seeing the perfect storm as we face the twin challenges of Covid and the impact leaving the transition period brings.Â This funding will help support the RWAS resilience at this difficult time for the sector.""
Deputy minister for culture, sport and tourism, Dafydd Elis-Thomas, said: ""It is important we support major events through these challenging times, so they are still there when we begin returning to normal."""

Federal Emergency Management Agency (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
From the we’ve been telling you so department, comes this honest briefing to the White House:
(CNSNews.com) – Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate said the frequency of tornadoes and hurricanes is cyclical, and he doesn’t know if global warming has anything to do with it.

“If you look back for the amount information we have going back to about 1850s, you’ll see a cycle, and it’s over decades of increased activity and decreased activity,” Fugate said. “And so that cycle has been there. As far anything driving that, I’d really defer to climate scientists.”
“Well, I’m not a meteorologist. I’m not a climate scientist, and hurricanes are cyclic,” Fugate responded. “I do know history, and if you look at history and you look at hurricane activity, there are periods of increased and decreased activity that occurs over decades,” Fugate said. “Throughout the ‘60s, ‘70s, early ‘80s, up until about ’95, the Atlantic was actually in a period of below-average activity, even though you had significant storms like Andrew, Frederic, and David.”
“Beginning about 1995, we saw an uptick in activity that has been sustained, and about the only variation is whether or not we’ve had El Niños or La Niñas, depending upon that for a factor,” Fugate continued. “But if you look back for the amount information we have going back to about 1850s, you’ll see a cycle, and it’s over decades of increased activity and decreased activity. And so that cycle has been there. As far anything driving that, I’d really defer to climate scientists.”
“But the reality is the history says we’ve had this period of activity, we’ve had a period of quiet,” Fugate said. “We’ve had a period of activity; we’ve had a period of quiet. And so what we’ve seen is not what we — we’ve seen this in history before.”
Fugate spoke Wednesday at a White House press briefing on the 2012 hurricane season that begins June 1.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst they told us that we would soon run out of fossil fuels. But now we are starting to hear that we have too much, so says Bill McKibben in an interview with utlra-warmist German site Klmaretter (Climate Rescuer).
Right now McKibben seems to be on a sort of trash-America tour in Europe, flying around in a fossil fuel burning jet, and telling eager US-hating leftist Europeans that America is a sort of backwards country.
Here are some excerpts of that interview:
Klimaretter: What do you about the electricity price going up because of investments in renewable energies or that the stability of the energy supply is being jeopardized? 
McKibben: I don’t think that it’s going to be without costs. But the costs are going to be far less than if we don’t do it. The costs from climate change are so enormously high that the costs of the transformation are affordable by comparison.
Klimaretter: What about the storage problem with renewable energies?
McKibben: It’s a problem. But increasingly thoughts are emerging that energy can be stored in unexpected places, […] like in auto batteries.

Klimaretter: What do you think of Obama’s plan of reducing emissions from coal power plants?
McKibben: The real test for Obama is coming when he decides on the Keystone Pipeline and the tar sands. If he makes the right decision, then he’ll be one of the first politicians of global ranking who will stop a project with such a big impact on the climate. That would be a good thing for the negotiations at an international level.
Klimaretter: Some people say that Americans are far more optimistic about climate change and see more opportunity being brought on by new technologies and new jobs. What do you think?
McKibben: I think Americans have their heads stuck in the sand when it comes to climate change. That’s especially strange because we’ve learned an incredible amount about climate change from American scientists. But our political system is in no way on par with the challenge. That is crushing.  […] The Germans and many others have done a much better job  […] But as you know from observing from a distance, political life in the USA has pretty much failed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German National Weather Service (DWD) has released the preliminary climate data for June 2013.
June in Germany has been quite variable with low temperatures recorded at the start and the end of the month, and a brief, yet record-setting heat just after the middle of the month. Early June also saw record precipitation resulting in wide scale flooding.
As for mean temperature for June, it was normal, which means it was way below model projections. Things aren’t supposed to be normal. The DWD writes:
The average temperature nationwide was 15.8°C. Thus it was about 0.4°C over the internationally valid reference period of 1961 to 1990. Compared to the 1981 to 2010 period, there was no deviation.
That means that there was no climate warming for Germany. According to computer models, which project a 4°C warming by the year 2100 for the current business-as-usual CO2 emissions, temperature today should be about 1.5°C above the 1961 – 1990 reference period mean. Therefore the mean temperature for Germany for June was yet again way below that which had been projected by climate models.

Global temperature development. Source: papundits/every-model-wrong/
The divergence between observed and model-projected global temperatures keeps getting broader. Too bad Obama’s advisors didn’t tell the president that.
According to the DWD, only a few days in June were summerlike and hot. At 98 liters of precipitation per square meter on average, June was 16% wetter than normal (85 l/m²), well within the normal range of variability. But stations in the south and east experienced particularly heavy deluges in early June, for example Aschau-Stein in Chiemgau on June 2-3, two hundred seventy five l/m² fell in 48 hours. From May 26 to June 2, more than 22,76 cubic kilometers of rain fell over Germany.
At approximately 200 hours, sunshine was normal (198 hours).
Lots of weather changes in June, but no climate change.

"While a privatised energy market has delivered stable and cost-effective electricity to Britain’s national grid for 25 years, the world and the pressures it faces are changing. A group of Newcastle University academics led by Professor Phil Taylor, director of the university’s Institute for Research on Sustainability, this week raised some important questions that go right to the heart of current energy policy dilemmas. One of the most controversial points is the contradiction between the liberalised energy market philosophy dominant since 1990, and governments’ apparent inability to ensure the market invests in the low-carbon technologies necessary to meet their ambitious emissions reductions targets. More central planning and a strategic view beyond market forces, the academics argue, is needed. So is a return to something like the CEGB, the Central Electric Generating Board responsible for Britain’s power supply until privatisation, the way forward? In reality, governments in the UK and abroad have for some time been drifting away from relying on market forces alone. The obvious explanation is that markets respond only to the signals they are given. If producing carbon and other greenhouse gases comes with no significant cost attached, then it is quite rational for power companies, responsible for delivering profits to their shareholders, to continue to burn fossil fuels. The main mechanism for introducing emissions limits through market forces, the EU emissions trading scheme, was largely undermined by an excessively generous initial issue of permits, doubts about the scheme’s long-term future and a lack of flexibility in responding to the recession or to the impact of other EU or national policies aimed at supporting renewables or energy efficiency. So Professor Taylor’s broadside is on strong ground when he argues that fossil fuel-generated energy is too cheap – little or no costs have been assigned to the very substantial future burden brought about by the consequences of a changing climate driven by CO2  emissions. Chief among the other market-limiting factors is the sheer uncertainty brought about by inconsistent energy and climate policy that deters new investment. This has already seen companies close power stations and abandon plans for new capacity. There is no global shortage of infrastructure investment money that seeks only modest returns in an era of low interest rates. But those investors quite reasonably demand at least a reasonable degree of certainty before investing huge sums. In practice that requires very strong government and regulatory commitments. British governments commitments to low-carbon investments include feed-in tariffs or other subsidies for both renewables and nuclear energy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), probably a vital component of a long-term strategy, has not received much funding so far, with only two projects (in Yorkshire and Scotland) underway. Like it or not, a green agenda has drawn government into making decisions for the power sector. It’s hard to see a return to reliance on markets alone to deliver climate policy objectives. The challenge is to make sure that this is done competently, resulting in a well-balanced mix of power generating plant for the future and equally important investments to improve transmission networks and energy efficiency. In the form of the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the government seems ill-equipped for the task.  Professor Taylor argues for “an independent, expert body who can act as an overall system architect”, but we need to be much more specific about what such a strategic authority would be and what we would want from it. Independent expert advice already comes through the Committee on Climate Change. We can assume a great deal of technical advice comes from the National Grid. But keeping the ultimate decision-making within government has serious weaknesses – not least an increased vulnerability to lobbying from special interest groups, and to a politicisation of the decision-making process. Almost certainly we require an independent agency formally responsible for delivering a low-carbon power sector, making procurement choices, and with the power to enter into long term contracts with energy companies. One option, but not the only one, would be to give these powers to the National Grid, which is already a vendor-neutral provider of core system services. Such an agency could be public or private sector, and unlike the CEGB would not be encouraged to own or build its own power stations. Whatever the answer this would be a major institutional change, with huge commercial implications for the sector.  Professor Taylor’s brief implicitly assumes that more central control and planning of supply will be compatible with the aim to generate more competition among supply companies. At the very least this is not obviously the case; in the context of current markets, central direction tends to undermine competition. We need a new take on the retail market that will allow more companies to take their own approaches to what products and packages to offer consumers. This should promote innovation in the ways consumers use energy, not least in ways that reflect its true cost, as Professor Taylor advocates. The most impressive example of a large and successful power sector decarbonisation has been the huge French nuclear programme of the 1980s. This was driven by political consensus on the strategic need to reduce oil dependency. Its essential features were a powerful but independent agency, combined with a wholehearted commitment from the government to the objective. In the UK, these have been often promised but not yet delivered. Britain need not copy France’s reliance on a nuclear programme, but these two features – often promised in the UK but not yet delivered – are not optional to copy its success."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe editor-in-chief of the Basler Zeitung Markus Somm has posted a damning, stinging commentary on the recently released AR5 Summary for Policymakers (SPM).
Somm first describes the AR5 SPM as a 40-page document pieced-together from 2000 pages “by climate scientists and representatives from numerous countries over four days behind closed doors in Stockholm.”
Then he describes the desperate straits which the proponents of anthropogenic global warming find themselves in, especially since numerous errors were uncovered in the earlier reports and observed temperature data have long since departed from the model projections. He describes the AR5 SPM (my emphasis):
It appears defensive. It is a masterpiece of dosed prophecy. Had Moses taken the same approach, he would not have convinced a single Jew to leave Egypt … In no paper from science or politics have I read the word ‘probable’ or ‘improbable’ so often.”
In Somm’s view the authors of the report appear less confident with their science than ever. He writes:
For some scientists boldness (and cockiness) have long disappeared since unliked climate skeptics uncovered some embarrassing errors in the last report: You can practically smell the authors’ perspiration of fear – and from time to time you even feel a little pity. With all computer models and measurements and simulations on which they fall back on: Things aren’t developing as they imagined a few years ago. […] For some scientists this inconvenient fact has pulled the rug from under their feet…So what to do?”
Somm calls the failed models a “fiasco for the scientists” and describes the efforts they expended to gloss over all the inconvenient facts.

In addition to citing failed models, Somm discusses the fact that CO2 concentration increased strongly over the last 15 years, yet failed to increase the global temperature and that climate scientists are exasperated in finding an explanation for this. In the report, Somm writes that they blame the oceans for absorbing more heat than assumed and that “the consensus with this question is merely ‘medium’“.
And thus Somm thinks it’s tragic that ambitious politicians would force expensive things like large scale renewable energy on such “rather volatile findings“.
Somm concludes:
In the latest IPCC report the scientists overall are significantly reducing their long-term forecast. For the first time. And probably not the last”.
Probabilities everywhere.

Peter Wallsten of the _Wall Street Journal_ writes, “Libertarianism is enjoying a recent renaissance in the Republican Party.” He cites Ron Paul’s winning the presidential straw poll earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Rand Paul’s upset victory in the Kentucky senatorial primary, and former governor Gary Johnson’s evident interest in a libertarian‐​leaning presidential campaign. Johnson tells Wallsten in an interview that he’ll campaign on spending cuts — including military spending, on entitlements reform, and on a rational approach to drug policy.   
  
  
Meanwhile, on the same day, Rand Paul had a major op‐​ed in _USA Today_ discussing whether he’s a libertarian. Not quite, he says. But sort of: 



In my mind, the word “libertarian” has become an emotionally charged, and often misunderstood, word in our current political climate. But, I would argue very strongly that the vast coalition of Americans — including independents, moderates, Republicans, conservatives and “Tea Party” activists — share many libertarian points of view, as do I.   
  
  
I choose to use a different phrase to describe my beliefs — I consider myself a constitutional conservative, which I take to mean a conservative who actually believes in smaller government and more individual freedom. The libertarian principles of limited government, self‐​reliance and respect for the Constitution are embedded within my constitutional conservatism, and in the views of countless Americans from across the political spectrum.   
  
  
Our Founding Fathers were clearly libertarians, and constructed a Republic with strict limits on government power designed to protect the rights and freedom of the citizens above all else.



And he appeals to the authority of Ronald Reagan: 



Liberty is our heritage; it’s the thing constitutional conservatives like myself wish to preserve, which is why Ronald Reagan declared in 1975, “I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism.”



Reagan said that several times, including in a _Reason_ magazine interview and in a 1975 speech at Vanderbilt University that I attended. A lot of libertarians complained that he should stop confusing libertarianism and conservatism. And once he began his presidential campaign that fall, he doesn’t seem to have used the term any more.   
  
  
You can see in both the Paul op‐​ed and the Johnson interview that major‐​party politicians are nervous about being tagged with a label that seems to imply a rigorous and radical platform covering a wide range of issues. But if you can call yourself a conservative without necessarily endorsing everything that William F. Buckley Jr. and the Heritage Foundation — or Jerry Falwell and Mike Huckabee — believe, then a politician should be able to be a moderate libertarian or a libertarian‐​leaning candidate. I wrote a book outlining the full libertarian perspective. But I’ve also coauthored studies on libertarian voters, in which I assume that you’re a libertarian voter if you favor free enterprise and social tolerance, even if you don’t embrace the full libertarian philosophy. At any rate, it’s good to see major officials, candidates, and newspapers talking about libertarian ideas and their relevance to our current problems.

Climate Change Scare continues down-under.
Story submitted by Tarun Singh
I thought it might be worthwhile to highlight another alarmist propaganda being peddled for science.
The below excerpts are from a news item warning on “climate change”
http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/climate-change-a-fundamental-health-risk/story-fn7x8me2-1226257929702
A LEADING Australian disease expert says prompt action on climate change is paramount to our survival on Earth.
Australian National University Epidemiologist Tony McMichael has conducted an historical study that suggests natural climate change over thousands of years has destabilised civilisations via food shortages, disease and unrest.
“We haven’t really grasped the fact that a change in climate presents a quite fundamental threat to the foundations of population health,” Prof McMichael said.
“These things have happened before in response to fairly modest changes to climate.
“Let’s be aware that we really must take early action if we are going to maintain this planet as a liveable habitat for humans.”
I would like to highlight a few things that I noticed :

a- There is no mention of the Paper’s title or reference provided. I went through the online website of PNAS at http://www.pnas.org/content/current#BiologicalSciencesEvolution and couldnt find a refernce to Tony McMichael , so unless I missed somthing most readers like me can’t verify what is IN THE PAPER.
b – The article has an underlying theme that paints “Climate change” , as a variable that can be controlled by Human interference , there is ample evidence against it as not all variables are understood regarding the different climatic changes.
c- The author concedes that this has been happening for thousands of years yet says “”Let’s be aware that we really must take early action if we are going to maintain this planet as a liveable habitat for humans.”  early action to mitigate what ????
At this point the narrative proceeds:
“With the exception of a few downward spikes of acute cooling due to massive volcanic eruptions, most of the changes have been within a band of about plus or minus three-quarters of a degree centigrade,” he said today.
“Yet we are talking about the likelihood this century of going beyond two degrees centigrade and quite probably, on current trajectory, reaching a global average increase of three to four degrees.”
This is just plain wrong if not deceptively misleading and alarmist.
It has now been accepted that MWP was warmer than now.
The second statement of reaching average increase of three to four degree in a decade , well that just goes to show the authors ignorance or ideological bend. As we all know that the 3 – 4 degree estimate is based on IPCC projections based on postive feedback which has scince been argued in various papers (lindzen and choi).
The falsehoods and misleading continues with  myths then quoted :
“Warming also leads to an increase in infectious diseases as a result of better growth conditions for bacteria and the proliferation of mosquitoes.”
The entire above statement can be categorically dismissed as alarmist hyperbole. However lets save the laughs for the next:
“Drought can also result in greater contact with rodents searching for scarce food supplies.”
The prof then goes on to explain what he considers important. Prof McMichael has been examining the impact of climate change on population health for 20 years and says it’s not easy to raise awareness of the risk.
“Most of the attention has been of a more limited shorter-term kind relating to things around us like the economy, our property, infrastructure and risks to iconic ecosystems and species.”
So in other words, people are stupid to argue about economy, personal property , infrastructure etc when it comes to CLIMATE CHANGE as its all for GREATER CAUSE.

"A new Michael Moore-produced documentary that takes aim at the supposed hypocrisy of the green movement is “dangerous, misleading and destructive” and should be removed from public viewing, according to an assortment of climate scientists and environmental campaigners. The film, Planet of the Humans, was released on the eve of Earth Day last week by its producer, Michael Moore, the baseball cap-wearing documentarian known for Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine. Describing itself as a “full-frontal assault on our sacred cows”, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to the climate crisis.  Planet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after describing it as “full of misinformation”, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film “more power and mystique than it deserves”. A free version on YouTube  has been viewed more than 3m times. A letter written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary Gasland, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of “shockingly misleading and absurd” film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans “trades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points” that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal. Michael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox’s letter, said the film includes “various distortions, half-truths and lies” and that the filmmakers “have done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.” The film’s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down. Planet of the Humans has been shown at Moore’s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was “perhaps the most urgent film we’ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival”. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists’ efforts rather than technological fixes. Climate activist Bill McKibben, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has “never taken a penny in pay” from any environmental group. “I am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I’ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,” McKibben said. “It does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.” Renewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions. In fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them, research has shown they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car. Generating all power from renewables will take significant upgrades of grid infrastructure and storage but several researchers have declared the goal feasible, most likely with carbon-capture technology for remaining fossil fuel plants. Scientists say the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050 to head off disastrous global heating, which would likely spur worsening storms, heatwaves, sea level rise and societal unrest."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship daily Frankfurter Allgeneine Zeitung has an analysis of the German Energiewende (transformation to renewable energy) and its consequences. It writes that the Energiewende “has lost its magic” among the public and that, “The new electric bills in August could be a catastrophe, both politically and economically. […] Now they [industry] are setting off the alarms.” In a nutshell: The Energiewende is costing a bundle.
European policy created its own unlevel energy playing field
Not long ago environmentalist Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin once told German consumers that the switch to renewable energies would be cheap and affordable, costing about as much as the price of a single scoop of ice cream each month. That scoop has since turned into gallon-buckets of Ben Jerry’s.
All told there are approximately 1.3 million solar power generating systems installed in Germany, and all are guaranteed a fixed exorbitant rate for the power they feed in. The added costs from the high rates paid to these producers are simply passed along to industry and ultimately the consumer. Now energy prices are sky high and German industry in many sectors cannot compete globally. The playing field is no longer level, the companies complain.
So far Germany has coped by granting many of its energy intensive industries exemptions from paying the renewable energy levies. A total of 2245 companies have been exempted from the feed-in surcharges, leaving the consumers to pick up the tab. But now Brussels is questioning these exemptions, claiming they represent an illegal subsidy for the companies. If revoked, companies once again will be facing high costs and a competitive disadvantage internationally. The solution: Either make energy cheaper for European countries, or insist the rest of the world makes its energy more expensive.
Europeanization of American energy prices
Currently German industry pays more than twice as much for its electricity than in the USA, and three to four times more for natural gas (USA is now exploiting its massive reserves of shale gas using fracking technology as Europe moves to ban fracking).

This increasingly unlevel energy playing field (created by Europe itself) is precisely what is driving Obama’s newly announced energy policy. Europeans have long complained that their competitiveness has been hampered by the USA’s “irresponsibly” low energy and electricity prices, and have insisted that Obama level the playing field by increasing prices in the USA. Somehow (using climate), Europe has convinced the USA to make its energy more expensive. Obama is happy to oblige.
Over the next decade Americans need to expect a Europeanization of American fossil energy prices. This is the what’s behind the plan announced by Obama yesterday. Obama is more than willing and ready to implement any scheme that is designed to punish Americans, it seems. This is only the first step.
Europe tells America: please repeat our blunders
Creating high prices for fossil fuels is only one component in “leveling the energy playing field”. Europe also expects America to repeat its renewable energy folly as well. America too must have a truly shoddy patchwork of inefficient and unpredictable renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, and an unstable power grid. Only this way can the playing field between America and Europe truly be level. European companies will then surely think twice about moving their operations to the USA.
Declaration of war on blue-collar workers
Ironically not long ago the stated objective of western politicians was to generate prosperity for its citizens. Today it’s precisely the opposite. Obama’s plan is nothing less than an assault on American industry and millions of blue collar workers.

"Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since lockdowns were imposed around the world due to the coronavirus crisis, research has shown. Daily emissions of the greenhouse gas plunged 17% by early April compared with 2019 levels, according to the first definitive study of global carbon output this year. The findings show the world has experienced the sharpest drop in carbon output since records began, with large sections of the global economy brought to a near standstill. When the lockdown was at its most stringent, in some countries emissions fell by just over a quarter (26%) on average. In the UK, the decline was about 31%, while in Australia emissions fell 28.3% for a period during April. “This is a really big fall, but at the same time, 83% of global emissions are left, which shows how difficult it is to reduce emissions with changes in behaviour,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia, and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “And it is not desirable – this is not the way to tackle climate change.” The unprecedented fall is likely to be only temporary. As countries slowly get back to normal activity, over the course of the year the annual decline is likely to be only about 7%, if some restrictions to halt the virus remain in place. However, if they are lifted in mid-June the fall for the year is likely to be only 4%. That would still represent the biggest annual drop in emissions since the second world war, and a stark difference compared with recent trends, as emissions have been rising by about 1% annually. But it would make “a negligible impact on the Paris agreement” goals, Le Quéré said. Emissions must fall to net zero by mid-century or soon after to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and keep global heating from reaching catastrophic levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The fall in carbon resulting from the Covid-19 crisis reveals how far the world still has to go, said Le Quéré. The experience of the crisis so far has shown that changes in behaviour by individuals – such as not flying, working from home and driving less – can only go part of the way needed to cut emissions, as even the lockdown measures left the bulk of emission sources intact, she said, adding that bigger shifts are needed to the way people produce and use energy. “Just behavioural change is not enough,” she said. “We need structural changes [to the economy and industry]. But if we take this opportunity to put structural changes in place, we have now seen what it is possible to achieve.” Emissions from aviation showed a dramatic decline, of about 60%, as international flights between many countries were grounded. Emissions from surface transport fell less sharply, by about 36%. Power generation and industry accounted for about 86% of the total decline in emissions. Despite such an unprecedented fall, the impacts on the climate are likely to be small. Stocks of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which reached 414.8 parts per million last year, will rise further towards the danger threshold of 450ppm this year, though perhaps at a slightly slower pace. “Carbon dioxide stays in the air a long time, so although emissions are smaller, they are still happening and so carbon dioxide is still building up, just a little more slowly,” said Richard Betts, the head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the paper. “If we want to halt the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we need to stop putting it there altogether. It’s like we’re filling a bath and have turned down the tap slightly, but not turned it off.” The lockdowns have caused steep falls in energy demand, but energy production has hardly been changed by the crisis, noted Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London, who was also not involved in the paper.  “The real lesson of this pandemic is that we must globally shift our energy production away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible if we are to ensure sustained year-on-year cuts to our global emissions,” he said. “The good news is that both of these will help to maintain the clean air and clear skies we have all rediscovered during lockdown, saving many lives.” The comprehensive analysis was conducted by scientists from the University of East Anglia, Stanford University in the US, the Cicero Centre in Norway, as well as scientists in the Netherlands, Australia, France and Germany. The researchers used measurements of economic activity, energy generation, industrial production, transport and other proxies to estimate carbon dioxide output. They concentrated their analysis on six areas: power generation, surface transport, industry, public buildings and commerce, residential sources, and aviation. Estimates were taken from 69 countries, 50 US states and 30 Chinese provinces, representing 97% of global carbon emissions. Although the rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere are regularly measured, they are subject to large natural fluctuations so are unsuitable to the kind of snapshot analysis required to observe what is happening to global carbon output over a relatively short period."

"**The phones began ringing off the hook at Piero Tintori's company Better Examinations back in April.**
His tech business allows tens of thousands of students to remotely sit exams at the same time, with each needing just a laptop, a webcam and an internet connection.
The firm's software uses machine learning (ML), an advanced form of artificial intelligence, to detect patterns in user behaviour that could indicate attempts to cheat. Its technology can also automatically mark multiple-choice answers and mathematics exams.
In addition, it checks each exam-sitter's identity using the webcam, to ensure that no-one else is sitting the test for them. The Better Examinations program also temporarily restricts access to the internet, or certain websites and applications on each person's computer.
""We had 60 organisations from all over the world contact us out of the blue, who wanted to run exams online in May and June,"" says Mr Tintori. ""Everything from universities, to professional organisations, to schools.""
With the firm's headquarters in Dublin, plus offices in the US, Australia and Poland, it uses Amazon's cloud computing system Amazon Web Services, to allow everything to work online.
Mr Tintori says he was also contacted directly by five governments (whom he declines to name), who were keen for school exams to go ahead.
Better Examinations is just one example of the increased use of ML in response to this year's pandemic, with the technology being used to do work far more quickly than humans, such as marking exam papers.
But what exactly is ML? It is a method of data analysis, whereby computer algorithms are used to speedily process vast amounts of data, to make predictions, identify patterns and replicate actions that humans do in their day-to-day jobs.
The use of ML is expected to grow so much over the next four years that its estimated global economic value is expected to rise from $7.3bn (Â£5.7bn) this year, to $30.6bn in 2024, according to one study.
Global law firm DWF, which helps the in-house legal teams of large corporations, is another business now increasingly using the technology.
It was approached by a large real estate company that had an ""impossible"" task. The client wanted 10,000 property lease documents, stored on paper and electronically, and in different locations, to be digitalised into a central database.
This firm also wanted to know the exact terms of each of the leases, to discover new commercial opportunities.
""Traditionally, you would get paralegals under supervision to plough through the documents. But from a cost point of view it doesn't work, and also it's inconsistent,"" says Mark Qualter, chief executive of DWF's managed services division.
DWF designed an ML system to classify each lease document into categories, identify specific types of details, and then extract data from the document.
The banking sector is also embracing ML. UK building society Nationwide had asked US computer giant IBM to build an artificial intelligence ""chatbot"" called Arti for it, to help first-time buyers understand how to get a mortgage.
But when the UK went into its first lockdown in March, and mortgage holidays were announced, the lender was instead inundated with queries about them.
In just four days, Arti - powered by AI platform IBM Watson - was retrained to answer mortgage holiday questions. The virtual agent also dealt with other questions as Nationwide saw online banking registrations jump by 89%.
""In just over two months, Arti had responded to more than 10,000 queries, and a further 350 per day since, freeing up hundreds of hours for frontline teams to focus their time handling more complex requests from members,"" says Michael Conway, UK lead for artificial intelligence at IBM Services.
""Put simply, it allowed Nationwide to focus its resources on those who needed the most help, without ignoring the needs of everyone else.""
Meanwhile, another UK retail bank has been using ML algorithms to identify customers who are showing indications of financial difficulty, so that they can be contacted automatically, and then offered support before matters get out of hand.
This has been provided to the lender by BJSS, a multinational technology engineering consultancy headquartered in Leeds.
Sri Harsha Tharkabhushanam, head of data science for BJSS, says that previously of those in arrears, 30% had got to a severe position where ""there was very little the bank could do for them at that point"".
But after implementing the ML model, the automated prompts meant fewer people were getting into severe difficulties, with the figure falling to 10%.
Business intelligence gathering using AI is also becoming a big deal.
For instance, a large European pharmaceutical firm, which wants to remain anonymous, wanted to make sure that if there was a new product launched, or start-up bought, by any of their competitors, it knew about it quickly.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
The company employed Filament AI, a machine-learning software firm in London, to build it a bespoke ML system that could monitor 1,000 websites, 200 story feeds, and roughly 200,000 news articles a day round the clock.
Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning at Oxford University, says that companies across many industries are now ""desperately trying to get their hands on ML"", as many more things are now being quantified digitally, making it easier to analyse them to gain insights.
Martha White, associate professor of computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada, agrees that the use of ML is growing fast.
""The combination of more data, and more powerful computers, and a focus on leveraging both has really propelled the field forward,"" she says.
""The prevalence will continue to grow for a few reasons. Firstly, there is still lots of low-hanging fruit, and the ability to monetise with the existing technology. Secondly, we are going to get better at improving our own decision making, using predictions from machine-learning systems.""
But although ML is becoming increasingly popular, there are concerns it has been oversold as a ""magic wand"", and the public's distrust of it is only rising, warns Prof Osborne.
""ML is not this all-singing, all-dancing solution to our woes,"" he says. ""Instead it's something that delivers value only when working hand-in-hand with humans, and having humans tailor it to their specific needs.
""ML is powerful, but not a fully general-purpose technology. It needs a lot of careful tweaking to get it to work for any new application."""

As I’ve [written many times](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/popular-leaders-policy-failures-australias-been-there-already/), now, Jacinda Ardern is more and more shaping up to be [New Zealand’s Kevin Rudd](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/someone-better-tell-the-fairy-queen-that-the-media-goblins-are-making-mischief/): a fresh-faced leader who rockets up to record highs in the opinion polls and sets the media swooning like a pack of teenage girls – and then collapses in ignominy and defeat in just one term. Ardern’s career is rapidly following the same trajectory, and hitting the same beats as Kevin Rudd’s.



Rudd quickly acquired a reputation as a narcissistic, globe-trotting PM more concerned about strutting at the UN than attending to domestic affairs. Even on the home front, Rudd was quickly seen as all talk and photo-ops, no substance. **Rudd became particularly notorious for his “brain-fart” policies** on “progressive” causes like climate change, which sounded good scribbled on the back of a coaster, but quickly collapsed into defeat and debt.



 **Is this all starting to sound familiar?**



But that hasn’t stopped the earnest immersing themselves into heroic levels of virtue signalling…And no one talks about stuff more than our **serial thought bubbler** , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern […]Politically speaking, this is why she has the issues she has. This is why the gloss has come off the shiny veneer of Ardernism.



  
Lyndon Johnson supposedly remarked that “If we’ve lost Cronkite, we’ve lost America”. When Kevin Rudd lost the Australian media, he lost his party and lost office. If Jacinda Ardern has lost ‘A Newspaper’, she should be very worried indeed.



Things aren’t looking much rosier for her over at _Newsroom_.



Jacinda Ardern’s election campaign was high on hope (remember relentless positivity?); hope for the homeless, hope for decisive action on climate change (“my generation’s nuclear-free moment”, she described it at her campaign launch); and hope for a new sense of coming together as a modern, progressive and compassionate nation. Upon coming to office, it was accompanied by a strong expression of energy and enthusiasm which persuaded New Zealanders that new times were indeed upon us.



There have been some stunning highs and many lows since those heady days. Sadly, the Prime Minister’s greatest high came in reaction to one of our country’s greatest tragedies…But there have been other (and more) times when the response has not been nearly as impressive, or sure-footed, and where the level of hope invested is not being repaid in Government actions.



One of Rudd’s government’s biggest Achilles’ heels was its woefully incompetent meddling in housing and infrastructure: “Building the Education Revolution” (blowing billions paying cowboys to put up school halls), the “Energy Efficient Homes Package” (blowing billions paying cowboys to put in dodgy insulation, which actually led to the deaths of several workers) and the NBN (blowing billions paying cowboys to put in fibre optic cables).



 **Again: sound familiar?**



KiwiBuild is an abysmal joke that has dashed the hopes of many and virtually destroyed the credibility of the Minister responsible, while housing very few […] As for the “nuclear-free moment” of climate change, the gap between the hope created by the rhetoric and the level of actual achievement is nearly as wide.



Then there was Rudd’s “closing the gap” grandstanding on Aboriginal affairs. For all the hot air, apologies and extra millions, the gap got wider. **Again – familiar?**



On a smaller scale, is the brewing Ihumatao situation. The Prime Minister was very quick to step in […] yet, [the] initial activist enthusiasm has waned considerably, much to the chagrin of the occupation organisers, who clearly and reasonably assumed that a Prime Ministerial intervention actually meant something.



Disappointment has now turned to anger.



Like Ardern, Rudd arrived in a puff of fairy-dust. But then the clock struck 12 and the glass slippers came off – and it was all over with shocking suddenness.



Voters are prepared to give a Government space and time to implement its policies, if they have a confidence the Government knows what it is doing. But that tolerance goes quickly if the public gains the feeling that it does not really know what it is doing, or grossly oversold its policy programme at election time […] At the same time, some have noticed that the Prime Minister seems more and more detached from the day-to-day grind of government.



  
Australia had “Kevin747”, New Zealand has its “PartTimePM”. It remains to be seen how similarly their stories come to an end.

A high ranking member of the Green Party is stepping down before next year’s election, citing the party’s drift to the centre as one of the reasons.



[…] “As an **indigenous ecosocialist** the last few years have been tough; the 2017 campaign, Metiria’s [Turei] resignation, and the continued centrist drift of the party’s direction under James Shaw’s co-leadership.



“When the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says we have **12 years to save the world** from climate catastrophe, we simply don’t have time for centrism, moderation or fiscal austerity.”

"Dire warnings of imminent human-induced climate disaster are constantly in the news but predictions of the end of the world have been made throughout history and have never yet come true. Even in the brief period of recorded history, natural climate change has always been with us – whether it is the volcanically induced crop failures that helped precipitate the French Revolution or the Medieval Warm Period that allowed Vikings to colonise Greenland. So how can we trust that the computer models scientists use to make predictions are reliable? There is sometimes reluctance to take experts’ words for anything and so we would like to be shown the evidence. Unfortunately, that is difficult when the details are buried under hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code which implement mathematical algorithms of mind-numbing complexity. There is, however, one branch of science that can reliably give an answer that is easy to understand and hard not to believe. Paleoclimatology – the study of Earth’s past climates – has used fossils to show links between global temperatures and carbon-dioxide levels. This record is written in stone. There are fossil plant-leaves from 55m years ago that have a microscopic structure which can be accurately reproduced in modern plants only when grown in a carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere. Is it a coincidence that, at the time, it was so warm that crocodiles were living within the Arctic circle?  And this is not an isolated case.  A sedimentary record covering half a billion years shows us exactly what we would expect to see if climate modellers have done their sums right. Fossil and chemical traces in rocks indicate that warm periods in Earth’s history are associated with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and quantitative studies show that this correlation is, if anything, even stronger than predicted. Those 55m year-old leaves suggest that carbon dioxide concentrations were about four times the present-day levels and back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that global mean temperatures were around 7°C higher. For comparison, the largely computer-based predictions published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change imply that quadrupling carbon-dioxide concentrations should increase temperatures by between 3°C and 9°C. The simple paleoclimate example may not nail the case for a worryingly strong link between carbon dioxide and temperature, but it is good supporting data. What is most important, however, is that this evidence is hard to refute  There is little doubt that the recent rapid increase in carbon dioxide is linked to human activities such as burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. But does the paleoclimate evidence really tell us that increased carbon dioxide must mean increased temperatures?  One objection might be that ancient climate change is really evidence for varying solar brightness. Fluctuating carbon dioxide levels are then a response to climate variation rather than the cause. However, solar physics tells us that the sun was fainter 55m years ago rather than brighter, as would be needed for higher temperature. Another concern is that some important processes, such as ice-sheet disintegration, only affect climate very slowly. Our warming ice sheets may take centuries to disappear completely but, when they do, the replacement of reflective-ice by heat-absorbing rock will warm our planet yet further. The existence of potential complications like these makes comparisons between paleoclimate change and modern climate change difficult but it is also one of the reasons why multiple approaches are needed. If different researchers using different methods nevertheless come up with more or less the same answer, perhaps they are onto something. Climate change deniers also confuse the argument by suggesting there is nothing we can do anyway. China and other rapidly developing countries will dominate carbon dioxide output in the 21st century. But that is irrelevant if we are simply asking: “Will increased carbon dioxide levels change our climate?” The fact that political and technical problems are massively more complex than anything in climatology is not a reason to stick our heads in the sand. Widespread agreement that man-made global warming is highly likely would be progress. Next, read this: Establishing consensus on climate change is vital for action"
"
I got into this investigation of Argo because I disbelieved their claimed error of 0.002°C for the annual average temperature of the top mile of the ocean. I discussed this in “Decimals of Precision“, where I showed that the error estimates were overly optimistic.
I wanted to know more about what the structure of the data looked like, which led to my posts Jason and the Argo Notes, Argo Notes Part Two, and Argo and the Ocean Temperature Maximum.
This is the next part of my slow wander through the Argo data. In How well can we derive Global Ocean Indicators from Argo data? (PDF, hereinafter SLT2011), K. von Schuckmann and P.-Y. Le Traon describe their method for analyzing the Argo data:
To evaluate GOIs [global oceanic indicators] from the irregularly distributed global Argo data, temperature and salinity profiles during the years 2005 to 2010 are uploaded spanning 10 to 1500m depth.
and
To estimate the GOIs from the irregularly distributed profiles, the global ocean is first divided into boxes of 5° latitude, 10° longitude and 3 month size. This provides a sufficient number of observations per box.
So I thought I’d take a look at some gridcell boxes. I’ve picked one which is typical, and shows some of the issues involved in determining a trend. Figure 1 shows the location of the temperature profiles for that gridbox, as well as showing the temperatures by latitude and day. The data in all cases is for the first three months of the year. The top row of Figure 1 shows all of the temperature for those three months (Jan-Feb-Mar) from all the years 2005-2011. The bottom row shows just the 2005 measurements. The following figures will show the other years.
Figure 1. Click on image for full size version. Gridcell is in the Atlantic, from 25°-30°N, and 30°-40°W. Left column shows the physical location of the samples within the gridbox. Colors in the left column are randomly assigned to different floats, one color per float. Right column shows the temperature by latitude. Small numbers above each sample show the day of the year that the sample was taken. Colors in the right column show the day the sample was taken, with red being day one of the year, shading through orange, yellow and green to end at blue at day 91. Top row shows all years. Bottom row shows 2005. Text in the right column gives the mean (average) of the temperature measurements, the standard deviation (StdDev), and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of the mean of the temperature data. The 95% CI is calculated as the standard error of the mean times 1.96.
Let’s consider the top row first. In the left column, we see the physical location of all samples that Argo floats took from 2005-2011. We have pretty good coverage of the area of the gridbox over that time. Note that the gridboxes are huge, half a million square kilometres for this particular one. So even with the 216 samples taken over the six-year period, that’s still only one sample per 2,500 square km.
Next, let’s consider the top right image. This shows how the temperatures vary by time and by latitude. As you would expect, the further north you go, the colder the ocean, with a swing of about three degrees from north to south.
In addition, you can see that the ocean is cooling from day 1 (start of January) to day 91 (end of March). The early records (red and orange) are on the right (warmer) side of the graph. The later records (green and blue) are concentrated in the left hand (cooler) side of the records.
This leads to a curious oddity. The spread (standard deviation) of the temperature records from any given float depends on the direction that the float is moving. If the float is moving south, it is moving into warmer waters, but the water generally is cooling, so the spread of temperatures is reduced. If the float is moving north, on the other hand, it is moving into cooler waters, and in addition the water is generally cooling, so the spread is increased. It is unclear what effect this will have on the results … but it won’t make them more accurate. You’d think that the directions of the floats might average out, but no such luck, south is more common than north in these months for this gridcell.
A second problem affecting the accuracy can be seen in the lower left graph of Figure 1. It seems that we have nine measurements … but they’re all located within one tiny part of the entire gridbox. This may or may not make a difference, depending on exactly where the measurements are located, and which direction the float is moving. We can see this in the upper row of Figure 2.
Figure 2. As in Figure 1, with the top row showing 2006, and the bottom row 2007.
The effects I described above can be seen in the upper row, where the floats are in the northern half of the gridbox and moving generally southwards. There is a second effect visible, which is that one of the two floats (light blue circles) was only within the gridbox in the late (cooler) part of the period, with the first record being on day 62. As a result, the standard deviation of the measurements is small, and the temperature is anomalously low … which gives us a mean temperature of 20.8°C with a confidence interval of ± 0.36°C. In fact, the 95% confidence interval of the 2006 data does not overlap with the confidence interval of the mean of the entire 2005-2011 period (21.7° ± 0.12°C) … not a good sign at all
The 2007 data offers another problem … there weren’t any Argo floats at all in the gridcell for the entire three months. The authors say that in that case, they replace the year’s data with the “climatology”, which means the long-term average for the time period … but there’s a problem with that. The climatology covers the whole period, but there are more gaps in the first half of the record than in the latter half. As a result, if there is a trend in the data, this procedure is guaranteed to reduce that trend, by some unknown amount.
Figure 3 shows the next two years, 2008-2009.
Figure 3. As in Figure 1 and 2, for 2008 (top row) and 2009 (bottom row).
2008 averages out very close to the overall average … but that’s just the luck of the draw, as the floats were split between the north and south. 2009 wasn’t so lucky, with most of the records in the south, This leads to a warmer average, as well as a small 95%CI.
Finally, Figure 4 shows 2010 and 2011.
Figure 4. As in Figure 1 and 2, for 2010 (top row) and 2011 (bottom row).
In the final two years of the record, we are finally starting to get a more reasonable number of samples in the gridbox. However, there are still some interesting things going on. Look at the lower right graph. In the lower right of that graph there are two samples (day 71 and 81) from a float which didn’t move at all over that ten days (see bottom left graph, blue circles, with “81” on top of “71”). In that ten days, the temperature in that one single location dropped by almost half a degree …
DISCUSSION.
In this particular gridcell, the averages for each of the years 2005-2011 are 21.4°C, 20.8°C, no data, 21.7°C, 22°C, 21.9°C, and 21.7 °C. This gives a warming trend of 0.13°C/year, as shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Trend of the gridcell three-month temperatures
My question is, how accurate is this trend? Me, I’d say we can’t trust it as far as we can throw it. The problem is that the early years (2005, ’06, and ’07) way undersample the gridcell, but this is hidden because they take a number of samples in one or two small areas. As a result, the confidence intervals are way understated, and the averages do not represent a valid sampling in either time or space.
My conclusion is that we simply do not have the data to say a whole lot about this gridcell. In particular, despite the apparent statistical accuracy of a trend calculated from from these numbers, I don’t think we can even say whether the gridcell is warming or cooling.
Finally, the law of large numbers is generally understood to relate to repeated measurements of the same thing. But here, two measurements ten days apart are half a degree different, while two measurements at the same time in different areas of the gridcell are as much as three degrees apart … are we measuring the “same thing” here or not? And if not, if we are measuring different things, what effect does that have on the uncertainty? Finally, all of these error calculations assume what is called “stationarity”, that is to say that the mean of the data doesn’t change over a sufficiently long time period. However, there is no reason to believe this is true. What does this do to the uncertainties?
I don’t have any answers to these questions, and looking at the data seems to only bring up more questions and complications. However, I had said that I doubted we knew the temperature to anything like the precision claimed by the authors. Table 1 of the SLT2011 paper claims a precision for the annual average heat content of the top mile of the ocean of ± 0.21e+8 Joules. Given the volume involved (414e+8 cubic kilometres), this means they are claiming to measure the temperature of the top mile of the ocean to ± 0.002°C, two thousandths of a degree …
As cited above, I showed before that this was unlikely by noting that there are on the order of 3500 Argo floats. If the SLT2011 numbers are correct and the error from 3500 floats is ± 0.002°C, it means that 35 floats could measure the temperature of the top mile of the ocean to a tenth of that accuracy, or ± two hundredths of a degree. This is highly unlikely, the ocean is way too large to be measured to plus or minus two hundredths of a degree by 35 floats.
Finally, people have the idea that the ocean is well-mixed, and changes slowly and gradually from one temperature to another. Nothing could be further from the truth. The predominant feature of the ocean is eddies. These eddies have a curious property. They can travel, carrying the same water, for hundreds and hundreds of miles. Here’s an article on one eddy that they have studied. Their illustration is shown as Figure 6.
Figure 6. Illustration of an eddy transporting water for a long distance along the south coast of Australia.
Figure 7 shows another example of the eddying, non-uniform nature of the ocean. It is of the ocean off of the upper East Coast of the US, showing the Gulf Stream.
Figure 7. Oceanic temperature variation and eddies. Blue box is 5° latitude by 10° longitude. Temperature scale runs from blue (10°C, 50°F) to red (25°C, 77°F). SOURCE 
The blue rectangle shows the size of the gridcell used in SLT2011. The red circles approximate the distribution within the gridbox of the measurements shown in the bottom row of Figure 1 for 2005. As you can see, this number and distribution of samples is way below the number and breadth of samples required to give us any kind of accuracy. Despite that, the strict statistical standard error of the mean would be very small, since there is little change in temperature in the immediate area. This gives an unwarranted and incorrect appearance of an accuracy of measurement that is simply not attainable by sampling a small area.
Why is this important? It is important because measuring the ocean temperature is part of determining the changes in the climate. My contention is that we still have far too little information to give us enough accuracy to say anything meaningful about “missing heat”.
Anyhow, that’s my latest wander through the Argo data. I find nothing to change my mind regarding what I see as greatly overstated precision for the temperature measurements.
My regards to everyone,
w.

"**Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT.**
First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases.
Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"".
Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut.
Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates.
Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November.
Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter.
The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"".
Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector.
""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another.""
The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added.
The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality within level three areas in Scotland.
However the rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place.
The decision will be reviewed on 17 December.
Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close.
Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed.
The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week.
The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants.
""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea.
Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants.
""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said.
Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"".
""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"".
Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that.""
""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes.""
Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties.
She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade.""
""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are.""
Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"".
""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year.""
Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business.
A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules.
""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous.
""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said.
The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell.
""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said.
""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time.""
BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford.
A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission.
Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November.
Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"".
According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales.
Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover.""
Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown.
""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said.
Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"".
The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000.
The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support.
A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses.
The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000.
The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before.
But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders.
Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to.
Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual.
Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade.
The money they are getting from the Welsh Government might well pay overheads like rent and insurance but these are businesses that have already taken a huge hit this year."

When I was a lad, Mum told me something about bullies: they’re only tough when they’re in a pack. They don’t have the guts to mouth off when they’re on their own, she said.



For all her prattle about “kindness”, Jacinda Ardern is acting a lot like a schoolyard-bully mean girl.



Ardern mouthed off at Australia for months over deportations – from a safe distance. When she visited Australia last month, she couldn’t backtrack fast enough. She’s suddenly talking tough again, now that she’s in with a clique of her pals at the Pacific Islands Forum.



Jacinda Ardern has challenged Scott Morrison to explain his ­government’s position on climate change to Pacific leaders as ­Australia fends off attacks over its domestic emissions policies ­despite committing $800 million to address global warming in the region.



…[Ardern], who has promised a ­carbon-neutral economy by 2050, yesterday declared that every ­nation needed to “do its bit” to fight worsening global warming, despite New Zealand providing $300m less than Australia in ­direct ­climate assistance for the Pacific over 10 years to 2025.



To achieve her carbon-neutral pledge, Ms Ardern has excluded agriculture and methane, which contribute about half of New ­Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.



Ardern is deliberately excluding New Zealand’s most emissions-heavy industry. At the same time, she is conspicuously failing to make up for her lack of action by stumping up any significant cash.



By the middle of next decade, Australia will have spent $800m in taxpayers’ money directly helping Pacific island nations — not including the $200m committed to the UN Green Climate Fund […]by contrast, New Zealand spent $200m in the region between 2015 and 2019 and is on track to spend a further $300m by 2023.



For all Ardern’s big-noting, Australia is half a billion dollars of real action ahead of New Zealand.



We’re well ahead in emissions reduction, too.



As Alan Jones – who has called Ardern a **“light weight hoax swallower”** – points out, Australia’s per capita emissions grew by just 1.8% since 1990 – New Zealand’s grew by 10.8%. Australia has 12 times the wind and solar generation of New Zealand.



On every metric, from handouts to emissions reduction, Australia is walloping New Zealand.



As Jones also notes, New Zealanders are voting with their feet. The Kiwi population in Australia has doubled. In fact, more than 11% of New Zealand’s population lives in Australia. There are 15 times more New Zealanders in Australia than the other way ‘round. For all the leftist social media circle-jerking about moving to Australia, the numbers tell the real story.



As for her cargo-cult bully gang, they’re just as spineless and two-faced. Pacific leaders talk a big game for the international media but clamp up to Australia’s face.



Sources said none of the leaders pushed Mr Morrison on climate change, despite strong statements by many at the forum on the need to accelerate emissions reductions to protect low-lying Pacific ­nations from rising seas and worsening storms. Several leaders, including Ms Ardern, emphasised the need for a consensus communique, which could help Australia in its fight to tone down the language of earlier drafts.



Like Jacinda Ardern, they’re all mouth and no trousers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch’s Klimazwiebel site here presents a just released video featuring some IPCC lead authors that is designed, it appears, to promote alarmism and the myth that the science is settled and that it is now time for policymakers to act decisively.

At 2:05 mark of video, we clearly see the above graphic. Note it only goes back 100 years or so and already the last 15 years show a glaring divergence – lack of correlation. If they had gone back 1000 years, there would be no correlation at all. There’s a clear attempt to deceive viewers here. That’s just one example.
Klimazwiebel asks readers to comment on the video. So far some early comments have been critical of the video’s haughty underlying message, some sharply critical. Here are some excerpts:
Richard Tol thinks the video appears “policy prescriptive”.
Marcel Crok: “not an attempt to present a neutral picture of the state of the science”

Werner Krauss: “This video tells a myth of power and superiority, and it only uses climate change to illustrate it.”
Eduardo Zorita: “I think the IPCC shoots itself in the foot. Climate models are by far not as perfect as it is suggested in the video – in fact most climate models cannot even reproduce the observed annual global mean temperature – let alone provide accurate regional projections for the future.”
Nice piece of propaganda with all the vital elements. What stands out to me is the one-sidedness of the video, ignoring the inconvenient truths from Antarctica, failed models and the 15-year warming pause (see 2:05 mark above). And note how these scientists try to come across as prophets who can see centuries ahead. Just the overall air of know-it-all arrogance these scientists take on makes you want to puke on your keyboard.
In summary, any scientist believing the nonsense needs a doctor, or an education in science – beginning from first grade.

Almost every major American daily newspaper picked up an article published earlier this month by _New York Times_ scribe Justin Gillis entitled “A Warming Planet Struggles to Feed Itself.”



How many times have we read, in the last 50 years, that this or that environmental apocalypse is going to starve the world? I got my doctorate on the wings of one; at that time it was called “global cooling,” after a 1974 CIA report leaked to the _Times_ said that rapidly cooling planetary temperatures could usher in an era of heightened global instability caused by food shortages.



In my lifetime there have been a large number of predicted nutritional apocalypses, caused by overpopulation, lack of biological diversity in our food supply, genetic engineering run amok, acid rain, too little ozone, too much ozone and, finally, global warming. If there were futures on the end of the world, I’d go short. The wrong bet won’t matter anyway.



Facts: Global surface temperature rose about three‐​fourths of a degree Celsius in the 20th century. U.S. corn yields _quintupled_. Life expectancy _doubled_. People got fat. Global warming didn’t cause all of this, but increased atmospheric carbon dioxide directly stimulated plant growth. Further, greenhouse warming takes place more in the winter, which lengthens growing seasons. With adequate water, plants then fix and yield more carbohydrate.



While doing my dissertation I learned a few things about world crops. Serial adoption of new technologies produces a nearly constant increase in yields. Greater fertilizer application, improved response to fertilizer, better tractor technology, better tillage practices, old‐​fashioned genetic selection, and new‐​fashioned genetic engineering all conspire to raise yields, year after year.



Weather and climate have something to do with yields, too. Seasonal rainfall can vary a lot from year‐​to‐​year. That’s “weather.” If dry years become dry decades (that’s “climate”) farmers will switch from corn to grain sorghum, or, where possible, wheat. Breeders and scientists will continue to develop more water‐​efficient plants and agricultural technologies, such as no‐​till production.



Adaptation even applies to the home garden. The tomato variety “heat wave” sets fruit at higher temperatures than traditional cultivars.



However, Gillis claims that “[t]he rapid growth in farm output that defined the late 20th century has slowed” because of global warming.



His own figures show this is wrong. The increasing trend in world crop yields from 1960 to 1980 is exactly the same as from 1980 to 2010. And per capita grain production is rising, not falling.



Gillis more rightly could have blamed any loss in per capita consumption on the stupid (I choose my words carefully) global warming policy that greens once touted: ethanol production from corn.



Even Al Gore now admits that corn‐​based ethanol produces more carbon dioxide than it saves. But as a result of recent ethanol policy, we are the first nation in world history to burn up its food supply to please a political faction.



Indur Goklany, a much‐​published scholar on the consequences of global warming policies, recently calculated that in 2010 alone, diversion of grain to biofuels (like ethanol) caused nearly 200,000 excess deaths in the developing world because of increased prices.



Roger Pielke, Jr., another noteworthy student of global warming science and policy, concurs. Regarding Gillis’ piece, he says: “The carbon dioxide‐​centric focus on the article provides a nice illustration of how an obsession with ‘global warming’ can serve to distract attention from factors that actually matter more for issues of human and environmental concern.”



Ever since people noticed how robust the increase of crop yields is, others have been saying that it must soon stop. This “limits to growth” argument is as tired as a farmer at the end of harvest. Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Global Wheat Rust Symposium that scientists are now producing “super varieties” of pathogen‐​resistant grain, which will tack another 15% onto yield. As the new strain is adopted, it will continue the linear upward trend in wheat yield for at least another decade.



I continue to be amazed at how little the facts are checked on global warming, even when writing for the so‐​called newspapers of record. Crop yields have increased at a constant rate despite changes in global temperature. Per capita grain production is going up, and stupid policies — not global warming — are putting people’s food security at risk.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA major part of Germany’s SPD socialist party, Germany’s second largest party behind Angela Merkel’s CDU conservative party, is coming to its economic and social senses on the issues of climate change and renewable energy. The threat of social unrest and lack of warming are gradually changing minds.

SPD boss Hannelore Kraft says industrial jobs are more important. Photo: SPD Landtagsfraktion NRW, public domain.
Hannelore Kraft, Minister President of Germany’s most populous state North Rhine Westphalia, the heartland of Germany’s heavy industry, has seriously upset the formidable green wing of her SPD party and companion Greens in claiming that preserving heavy industry jobs in her state is more important than the rapid transition over to renewable energies.
The Ruhr region of North Rhine Westphalia employs tens of thousands of jobs in the traditional sectors of coal, steel, and energy. But the continued massive subsidization of renewable energies is a real threat to these jobs and to trade union members who are a major traditional voting block the SPD. The situation reminds us of Senator Joe Manchin in West Virginia.
Germany’s center-left online Süddeutsche Zeitung reports that “North Rhine Westphalia Minister President wants to fight to preserve jobs in steel and power companies. That’s more important than the rapid transition to renewable energies, the SPD politician said in an SZ interview. …’It’s important that we preserve the industrial jobs in our state.'”

Kraft’s words send a clearsignal that a new grand coalition government between Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU conservative parts and the SPD party are poised to abandon any plans for continuing the rapid transition to renewable energies like we’ve seen over the last years. This would be a massive blow to the climate alarmism movement and to renewable energies. Moreover with Germany’s two major parties being in agreement on the issue, there would be very little political opposition to stop the major scale back.
Recently German energy behemoth RWE announced that it is considering closing its massive Garzweiler II open-cast lignite mine earlier than planned. The Süddeutsche writes this would cost 10,000 jobs. The Süddeutsche also adds, “Thyssen-Krupp director Heinrich Hiesinger has made its steel production staying at it traditional location in Duisburg dependent on that the energy intensive steel sector being exempt through the hardship clause from having to pay the energy feed-in tariffs.”
Clearly renewable energies have reached a point in Germany where energy intensive companies are presenting politicians with real a ultimatum: Either you lighten up on the renewable energy craze, or we’re gone! The mass social unrest that would potentially be caused by a mass industrial exodus is something no responsible politician in power wants to risk having to deal with.
The Green party and the green wing of the socialist party have reacted angrily to Hannelore Kraft’s compromise with heavy industry, assuring plenty of internal conflict ahead.

Arabic records allow past climate to be reconstructed
The study has been published in Weather, a publication of the Royal Meteorological Society
Corals, trees and marine sediments, among others, are direct evidence of the climate of the past, but they are not the only indicators. A team led by Spanish scientists has interpreted records written in Iraq by Arabic historians for the first time and has made a chronology of climatic events from the year 816 to 1009, when cold waves and snow were normal.
The Arabic historians’ records chronologically narrate social, political and religious matters, and some of them mention climate. A study led by researchers from the University of Extremadura (Spain) has focused on ancient meteorological notes of the Iraqi city of Baghdad. 
“We have recovered an interesting chronology of climatic events, such as droughts, floods, rain, frost, heat and cold waves as well as strong winds during the period between 816-1009 in the areas now known as Iraq and Syria” Fernando Domínguez-Castro, lead author and researcher in the Physics department at the University of Extremadura, informed SINC.
This study, which has been published in the Weather journal, highlights a high number of cold waves. “The period between 902 and 944 had a high number if we compare them to current weather data. Examples of this are the six snowfalls that occurred in that period, whilst in our era, we only know of one snowfall in Baghdad on 11 January 2008” Domínguez-Castro highlights.
More cold days due to volcanic eruptions
The research team was especially surprised by the “unexpected” drop in temperatures in July 920. According to the documents analysed, the people of Baghdad had to come down from their roofs (where they would usually sleep in the summer) and go inside their houses and even use blankets. The temperatures could have dropped 9ºC compared to the current average for the month of July.
“It is difficult to identify the cause of this drop in temperature, but it could be due to a volcanic eruption the year before, as it is common for summer temperatures to drop in these cases” the expert points out and says that during some of those nights in July 920, temperatures did not exceed 18ºC.
There were two significant volcanic eruptions during that period, which could be the cause of the cold waves, “although there is a lot of doubt surrounding the dates”, the researcher states. One of those was the Ceboruco volcano (Mexico), around 930, and the other was the Guagua Pichincha (Ecuador), around 910. Nonetheless, “more evidence is necessary to confirm this hypothesis” the expert warns.
The research shows that during the first half of the tenth century, the cold climatic events in Baghdad were more frequent and more intense than today. Although in the Iraqi city only two days with temperatures below 0ºC were registered between 1954 and 2008, there were at least six very cold days in a 42 year period in the tenth century.
According to the researchers, “the Arabic records are very useful for reconstructing the climate in eras and places about which we know very little”. Thanks to the synergy of humans and science ‘robust climate information’ has been extracted” they conclude.
Baghdad, the centre of the empire
In 762, Abu Ja’far Abdallah al-Mansur, the second Abbasid Caliph (the second Islamic dynasty), founded the city of Baghdad and established it as the capital of the empire. The city soon became the most prosperous place at the time, and the centre of international trade and agricultural development, which attracted a growing population.
Historians of the era debated reasons as to why the Caliph gave so much importance to Baghdad. As well as its strategic location between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the city had good weather conditions. “There was plenty of water, the weather was very warm in the summer, very cold in the winter, and moderate in spring and autumn,” Al-Ya`qubi described, author of a geographical treatise in 891.

"The UK’s economy is highly unbalanced; we have the worst regional disparities in the developed world and London’s property prices are also the world’s most expensive – second only to Monaco. Rebalancing the economy is crucial to our future, and it can be done.  With the right investment in transport infrastructure, a second megacity formed by linking Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, is achievable and could rebalance the UK economy by shifting focus from the dominating south-east. This could be achieved by creating an economic powerhouse in the north, one that replicates the very factors that underpin London’s growth: a large and diverse population and economic base, the ability to attract and retain talent, a critical mass of smart professionals and super-creatives, excellent science institutions, universities and schools, vibrant arts and culture and a first class regional, national and international transport. It’s a tall order. Even the best of the Britain’s second-tier cities would struggle to deliver all this. None of them is big enough – and we know that in modern economies size does matter. Geoffrey West, a physicist at the Santa Fe Institute, has analysed the mathematics of cities and says that there is a rule that holds firm in cities across the world.  According to West, each doubling in size of a city brings with it a 15-20% increase in wages, number of patents filed, the number of highly creative people employed, and an increase in efficiency of transport systems, among others. At the same time there is a matching increase in crime and pollution – but the benefits of higher wages and greater opportunities outweigh these disadvantages. London reflects this urban mathematics. Outside the Greater London region there is perhaps only one place in the UK where these economies of scale could be replicated: in the heavily urbanised east-west belt that stretches from Liverpool, through Manchester and over the Pennines to Leeds. These three city regions have scale, dignity and presence. They also have a massive asset in Manchester International Airport. Their universities are among the country’s leading research institutions and decent housing is affordable – especially for the young professional families now being priced out of London’s housing market or forced to accept crippling commuting and mortgage costs.  Manchester and Leeds are dynamic cities with a strong track record in delivering new jobs. Until recently, Liverpool’s record on jobs was shaky. But it has made a startling recovery based on tourism and conferences, as well as its traditional sectors. Higher speed rail connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds (and perhaps Sheffield) could reduce the Liverpool-Leeds journey time to only 50 minutes, bringing together the cities’ labour markets, generating critical mass and driving the creation of agglomeration economies from bringing the cities closer together. David Higgins, chairman of HS2, drew attention to this issue in a recent speech – as did chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne this week.  Peter Hall, David Thrower and I set out detailed proposals for “High Speed North” in April 2014, building on the extremely modest Northern Hub investment and electrification between Liverpool and Leeds which is already committed or in progress.  These began with the introduction of the Pendolino “tilting trains”, required to cope with the steep gradients and sharp curves on the trans-Pennine route. It also included a reintroduction of four-tracking – a railway dual carriageway, with two tracks travelling in each direction – to provide greater capacity and allow fast trains to overtake slower services. The proposals also called for local trains in Manchester to be rerouted onto new sections of the Metrolink tram system.  For later stages of the project, we proposed a new 20-mile route from Warrington to Liverpool, which would become part of the High Speed North network and a vital high speed connection from HS2 to the centre of Liverpool, increasing capacity on an increasingly busy passenger and freight route. And finally, a new 13-mile “base tunnel” under the Pennines from Manchester to Huddersfield – startling as it may sound, new rail tunnels are not uncommon in other countries such as Germany.  The evidence we have seen on comparable tunnels suggests a range of construction costs between £1.5 and £4 billion. London’s Crossrail, which is of similar length, has cost £16 billion. The chancellor’s Manchester speech this week did bear an uncanny resemblance to our earlier ideas. Was it plagiarism, thought leadership or just a bizarre coincidence? We don’t know and we don’t mind. For once, the government is running with a big, imaginative and relatively inexpensive idea.  To be sure other things need to happen in these northern cities. But the Chancellor’s proposal should be explored further, not dismissed as another bright idea that will end up in a cupboard after the next general election."
"Last month, the Guardian quoted Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, saying if we put post-pandemic bailout money in the wrong place “we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets” (‘Coronavirus profiteers’ condemned as polluters gain bailout billions, 17 April). We beg to differ. It is game over for preventing dangerous climate change now that governments are planning the cheapest and quickest return to consumption. Riding on the wave of cheap oil and fossil-fuel bailouts is incompatible with keeping the average global temperature rise below 2C, let alone 1.5C.  Even if the world agreed to maintain all the pandemic-enforced restrictions on travel and consumption, the emissions saved would amount to almost nothing, compared with what’s needed to achieve the Paris agreement’s climate targets. Yet whether it’s to discourage mass fatalism, or prevent the very worst of what the future threatens, those of us with this knowledge still cling to “yes we can”. In this story, it is always five to midnight; it is always the last chance to prevent disaster. In contrast, collective action on climate can only grow out of complete honesty. It is time to acknowledge our collective failure to respond to climate change, identify its consequences and accept the massive personal, local, national and global adaptation that awaits us all.Dr Wolfgang Knorr Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University, Prof Eric Rignot University of California, Irvine, Prof Rik Leemans Wageningen University and Research, Prof Andy Morse School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool, Prof Dennis Baldocchi Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, Prof Thomas Hickler Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Prof Francis E Putz Department of Biology, University of Florida, Prof Maarten Krol Wageningen University, Dr Alberte Bondeau Institut Méditerranéen de Biodiversité et d’Ecologie, Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, Prof Wolfgang Cramer Institut Méditerranéen de Biodiversité et d’Ecologie, Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, Prof Paul Palmer University of Edinburgh, Dr James G Dyke Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter • Oxford University’s call for a green stimulus for the economy and Polly Toynbee’s demand for a dramatically fairer reversal of the impact of “wealth on health” could both be addressed by a nationwide Green New Deal programme (Poverty kills people: after coronavirus we can no longer ignore it, 5 May). This would allow a way out of the economic collapse caused by coronavirus, while rebuilding our social infrastructure and tackling the climate emergency. It can also provide new jobs and huge opportunities for businesses. At its heart must be a labour-intensive social infrastructure that rebuilds our austerity battered public services. The prioritisation of green infrastructure will require a shift of economic priorities towards more decentralised local economies that reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, minimise the throughput of raw materials, provide long-term food security and protect biodiversity.  This radically new approach will involve listening to climate experts, funding the transition needed through massive government borrowing and introducing policies to curb our “freedoms” to travel, eat and consume in ways that threaten the planet. It is a Green New Deal imperative to tackle both the social and climate crisis that must emerge as the exit strategy from coronavirus.Colin HinesConvenor, UK Green New Deal Group • It is not only whales that are enjoying the opportunity for improved “conversations” presented by the current drop in manmade noise levels (Silence is golden for whales as lockdown reduces ocean noise, 27 April). From insects to fish, nature is booming as human activity intrudes less during lockdown. In our gardens, birdsong is more noticeable without a constant soundtrack of traffic noise. When our activities increase post-lockdown, we should reflect on the joy these sounds have given us and consider more permanent changes to the way we share the planet with our wildlife, for the benefit of all.Andy RadfordProfessor of behavioural ecology, University of Bristol"

"School has resumed after the holidays, and it will not be as any student has experienced before. But this isn’t the first time we have sacrificed our education to flatten a curve for the greater good. We’ve been doing it since 2018 when we decided to forego school classes on Fridays to bring attention to the climate crisis and the exponential curve of fossil fuel emissions that, according to the World Health Organisation, kills seven million people a year. As young people locked in our houses with endless video calls for uni and work, we are worried. Are we the first generation to watch the world go through two exponential crises? One of medical concern, threatening the lives of millions and locking down countries. And the other a climate crisis that is already affecting billions and could end life on this planet as we know it. There is no denying the horrific consequences of Covid-19, with a terrifying mortality rate and a frightening ability to spread. The loss of life is awful. But it has given hope the world can take the collective action needed to stop it. We have acted for Covid-19 by putting aside our political squabbles; we can do this for the climate crisis too. Covid-19 exacerbates inequalities that already exist in our society. It is already vulnerable people who suffer most: low-income families, those in regional and rural areas, First Nations people, young people, women and elderly people. This is also true of climate change. And just like with Covid-19, we all need to play our part in adjusting the new normals of our world, because it will never be the same again. As countries increase their lockdowns and individuals are travelling far less, global emissions are reducing and air quality is increasing. But this comes at the expense of far too much. We should not have to wait for a global pandemic to threaten the lives of millions to reduce emissions. This is not climate justice. This accidental emissions reduction comes with no acknowledgement of past damages from large corporations, who are the greatest contributors to climate change. It comes with no international agreement and without any acknowledgment that those most affected by the climate crisis have contributed the least to it. Climate justice is listening, acknowledging and fighting for and with those who contribute the least pollution. We all have a responsibility to act on the crisis and take ownership of our contributions. Climate action is not the accidental result of a pandemic. While public health studies continue and climate activism takes a back seat, watching the global response to this pandemic proves that international cooperation is possible. Governments and our leaders are out of excuses. We now know that radical change can happen when a crisis is taken seriously. The lockdown measures are crucial for keeping communities safe from this terrifying virus, and once lifted, hopefully more lessons can be learned to champion climate justice. We are facing a drastically different world after the crisis, one with a new global narrative about quality of life and our right to access it. We all have the power to influence that. As young people, we have the right to demand a future that is safe and healthy. We are at a unique tipping point. If climate change were treated like the crisis that it is, governments would respond swiftly, instead of spending decades debating the cost of action. We know that governments around the world can make big, positive changes when a situation demands it. We’ve seen them do just that during Covid-19. So, will we flatten the climate curve as well? • Toby Thorpe is a climate activist from Tasmania. Bryher McKeown is a health science student at the Australian National University.

Some background from the original “hide the decline” from Steve McIntyre here
Despite relatively little centennial variability, Briffa’s reconstruction had a noticeable decline in the late 20th century, despite warmer temperatures. In these early articles [e.g. Briffa 1998], the decline was not hidden.
For most analysts, the seemingly unavoidable question at this point would be – if tree rings didn’t respond to late 20th century warmth, how would one know that they didn’t do the same thing in response to possible medieval warmth – a question that remains unaddressed years later.
He writes now in Hide-the-Decline Plus
Indeed, they did not simply “hide the decline”, their “hide the decline” was worse than we thought. Mann et al did not merely delete data after 1960, they deleted data from 1940 on, You can see the last point of the Briffa reconstruction (located at ~1940) peeking from behind the spaghetti in the graphic below:


Detail from Mann et al (EOS 2003) Figure 1. Arrow points to Briffa series peeking out from behind the spaghetti
Had Mann et al used the actual values, the decline would have been as shown in the accompanying graphic:

Figure 3. Re-stated Mann et al (EOS 2003) Figure 1 showing the decline.
Had Mann and his 13 co-authors shown the Briffa reconstruction, without hiding the decline, one feels that von Storch (and others) might have given more consideration to Soon et al’s criticism of the serious problem arising from the large-population failure of tree ring widths and density to track temperature.

Today Switzerland’s NZZ published an online commentary written by Markus Hofmann titled State-Certified Climate Science. In it he writes:
What the heck was the German Federal Office Of Environment (UBA) thinking when it decided to publish a 118-page report on the climate debate? The propaganda brochure is called: ‘And indeed the warming continues – What’s behind the climate change debate?’. It is causing a number of journalists to blow their tops with outrage.
[…] Indeed for the UBA it is obviously not about presenting facts simply and clearly. ‘And indeed the warming continues’ pamphlet is a declaration of war on so-called climate skeptics.
The UBA doesn’t stop at defaming the ‘non-climate scientist skeptics’ in general terms. No, it names the persons – putting Fritz Vahrenholt, Sebastian Lüning, Dirk Maxeiner, Michael Miersch, Günter Ederer and the ‘European Institute for Climate and Energy’ (EIKE) on a black list. That is ‘official state defamation,’ heute.de writes.

[…] Specifying what the binding state of the science is, is not the job of a governing authority,’ legal expert Thorsten Koch correctly opines in ‘Die Welt’.
Now the debate is off and running: The gentlemen who were criticized by the state are now responding. Vahrenholt is defending himself in an open letter. Maxeiner and Miersch are firing back.
Thus precisely the opposite of what the UBA wanted is now happening: The ‘climate skeptics’ are now in the spotlight. The state’s shot at the skeptics has backfied.”
Yesterday Spiegel published satirical commentary authored by Jan Fleischhauer saying that basically the state has officially declared skeptics as misfits and that everyone should stop listening to them. The UBA defamatory pamphlet singles out veteran journalists Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch for “not being in line with the latest state of knowledge of climate science“. Fleischhauer writes:
If this were about anything less important than global climate, one could take the UBA’s intervention as a badge of honor: There are not many journalists in Germany whose works are so shattering that they would be put on a black list. I know people who would kill to get that kind of recognition.”
The UBA’s pamphlet is indeed a major backfire in the face of the UBA. Flasbarth should resign and a new successor should announce a more tolerant, impartial and open stance in the climate debate.
Tomorrow I will be presenting Maxeiner’s and Miersch’s reply.

The first Earth Day took place in 1970, when I was a high school senior, and that day set the course of my life for the next 25 years. Convinced of the need to protect the environment and realizing that forests were a key part of the environment in my home state of Oregon, I elected to attend forestry school, graduating in 1974.



Over the next two decades, I helped almost every major environmental group in their efforts to save public forests from what we thought were the rapacious hands of timber companies. But I soon realized that the real problem was that Congress had inadvertently given public land agencies budgetary incentives to lose money harming the environment, and disincentives to either make money or do environmental good.



This insight helped me see that creating markets for all resources would allow them to compete on a level playing field. Recreation fees, for example, could reward public land managers for protecting things that recreationists care about, such as scenery, diverse wildlife habitat, and clean water. Though economists estimated that recreation was worth more than any other public land resource, Congress didn’t allow managers to charge for most recreation.



Many environmentalists in the 1970s and 1980s were receptive to my ideas of reform. Our common goal was to protect the environment, and they happily accepted any tools that would solve a particular environmental problem best. Soon, Congress passed a law allowing federal land agencies to charge recreation fees and to keep those fees.





Giving government power to solve a problem is not the same as actually solving the problem.



Unfortunately, things changed in the early 1990s because of two events: the fall of the Soviet Union and the election of Bill Clinton to the White House.



Polls showed that the fall of the Soviet Union persuaded most Americans that government was a poor solution to most problems. One of the few exceptions was environmental protection, which many Americans still believed needed government regulation. This led many self‐​described “progressives,” who believe in more government control, to push their agenda by joining the environmental movement.



Meanwhile, Clinton’s election changed the financing of the environmental movement. From 1981 through 1992, environmental groups raised much of their money by charging that Republicans in the White House threatened the environment. With a Democrat as president, grassroots funding for environmental groups plummeted.



To make up the difference, most groups turned to foundation grants. But foundations demanded that the groups they funded all adopt the same strategy. Progressives took this opportunity to demand that their strategy — transferring power from on‐​the‐​ground forest managers to political appointees – be the one that was adopted. For example, they opposed recreation fees because, with everything controlled from Washington, they didn’t think they needed to rely on incentives.



The progressive goal was not environmental protection but government control. They believed they knew how every acre of land in the country should be managed, which forests should be cut, which crops should be planted on which farms, and how many urbanites should live in apartments instead of single‐​family homes.



The constitutional rights and personal desires of property owners, the expertise of public land managers, and the housing preferences of homebuyers were unimportant compared with the greater good that could be achieved through central control of our natural resources.



When free‐​market environmentalists showed that most environmental problems could be solved with better incentives, progressives latched onto climate change as the one issue that demanded complete government control. “Climate change is a collective problem that demands collective action,” enthuses Naomi Klein, and it “supercharges the pre‐​existing case for virtually every progressive demand on the books.”



Giving government power to solve a problem is not the same as actually solving the problem. Instead, that government is more likely to make the problem worse as it abuses its power. Klein’s own proposals for climate change — “subways, streetcars and light‐​rail … everywhere” and high‐​density “housing along those transit lines” — will have practically no effect on climate but devastating effects on our economy.



Air, water, wildlife, forests, and other things we call “the environment” are precious and deserve our care. But freedom is also precious. The most important lesson of my four decades as an environmentalist is that you can’t have one without the other.

"**The number of investment scams has quadrupled since the first UK lockdown began in March with fraudsters using more sophisticated tactics.**
Scammers have been cloning fund managers' websites, products and documents to steal almost Â£10m ($13.3m) from UK investors.
Fraudsters are even creating fake price comparison websites, says the Investment Association (IA).
The reported number of scams almost quadrupled from around 300 to 1,175.
""In a year clouded in uncertainty, organised criminals have sought opportunity in misfortune by attempting to con investors out of their hard-earned savings,"" said Chris Cummings, chief executive of IA.
Losses added up to Â£9.4m between March and mid-October, due to sophisticated ""cloning"" investment scams.
The Investment Association discovered scammers had been promoting fake products on sham price comparison websites and adverts on social media and search engines.
""The investment management industry is working closely with the police and regulators to stop these scams, and is collaborating with our partners in government to close them down and prevent them being advertised in the first place,"" Mr Cummings added.
The trade body has a dedicated live webpage for investors to research and avoid identified scams.
Earlier this month Britain's Action Fraud revealed victims of investment fraud had lost at least Â£657m in the past year, a rise of 28%.
The fraud and cybercrime prevention organisation said scammers have been looking for opportunities during coronavirus pandemic.
""Preying on people when they are at their most vulnerable really shows how low these criminals will stoop to make a profit for themselves,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud.
""Just because a company has a glossy website and glowing reviews from 'high net worth' investors does not mean it is genuine,"" Action Fraud warned."
"Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil is at its highest rate in a decade, according to new satellite data. This comes after president Jair Bolsonaro has loosened environmental regulations, cut enforcement budgets, and supported further development in the region.  Trees absorb carbon dioxide naturally, and are one of best tools we have to help stave off climate catastrophe – and the Amazon itself is a crucial carbon sink. This means responding to deforestation in Brazil has become a matter of international responsibility. The primary purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. With climate breakdown already causing conflict and undermining human security, it’s hard to argue the UN should not get involved.  So what could it do about Brazil’s deforestation? My PhD research examines the intersection between environmental governance and the UN Security Council. The council is a legislative body designed to safeguard international peace and security – it’s made up of five permanent members and ten non-permanent (elected) members. I want to consider three options available to it: the support of international law; intervention through force; and sanctions.  Brazil was one of the 195 signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which set global targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming below 2℃ or ideally 1.5℃. Article 5 of the Agreement says that parties “should take action” to preserve forests due to their role as carbon sinks. The problem is the word “should”, which places very little legal obligation on parties. As part of the Paris Agreement, Brazil pledged to protect the Amazon through the restoration of 12m hectares of forest by 2030 (that’s an area roughly the size of England). The problem is Bolsonaro himself didn’t agree to the treaty. And although he has indicated Brazil will remain part of it, his policy thus far – strongly pro- development in the Amazon – means there is very little hope he will stick to the reforestation commitment.  In any case, the Paris Agreement lacks enforcement mechanisms – if Bolsonaro simply decides to ignore Article 5 and continue deforesting there is little the other signatories can do. In light of this the Security Council calling for the implementation of the Paris Agreement would have little tangible impact, and so we must consider other possibilities. It might sound drastic, but if international peace and security is under threat, this means the UN Security Council could intervene under Article 42 which authorises the use of force to halt those actions causing the menace. Force has been used in the past, for instance to create corridors of protection for people in warzones. Extending this idea, a UN force could be directed to provide a perimeter of protection around the Amazon and halt all deforestation activities. However, tanks and troops on the ground means invading a sovereign nation. It means saying dialogue is over. And crucially it rarely results in a clean resolution. Any intervention would likely be met with a response from the Brazilian military – which has hundreds of thousands of troops and the world’s 12th largest budget – and many lives would likely be lost. UN-backed military intervention must balance all this against the cost of inaction. Furthermore, military force also comes with massive environmental impacts and logistical challenges. It is not a credible response to deforestation. Under Article 41 of the UN Charter, the Security Council can impose sanctions to maintain or restore international peace and security. These sanctions are intended as non-military steps in order to coerce uncooperative governments or individuals. A comprehensive sanctions scheme can have significant impacts upon the internal situation of a country, forcing compliance with agreed international standards. But sanctions are not always successful and often have a major humanitarian impact. However the sort of broad brush approach that may have harmed ordinary people in Haiti, for example, is not the only option available – the Security Council could instead introduce targeted sanctions that have less collateral impact. In 1998 the UNSC targeted the exploitation of natural resources that was bankrolling conflict in Angola, and introduced Resolution 1173 which meant all states were obliged to ensure that any diamonds imported were sourced from an official certification scheme. Similar restrictions were also imposed on Sierra Leone, and a later resolution endorsed the Kimberly Scheme that aims to regulate the diamond trade. During the Liberian conflict in the early 2000s, the Security Council recognised that the timber trade was fuelling the situation. Through Resolution 1521 the import of all “round logs and timber products originating in Liberia” was prohibited. The sanction was successful: among other things, it encouraged Liberians with logging licences from the previous Charles Taylor regime to rethink their claim on the forests and begin a national dialogue. Applying this here, the Security Council could prohibit the sale of all Brazilian timber, and sanction all imports of beef reared in areas of deforestation. Some might argue this interferes with Brazilian sovereignty in a way that the above examples did not. And for all the faults of its current leader, and perhaps even its entire political class, the country remains more stable, and a more mature democracy, than the likes of Liberia or Angola during civil wars. It’s also considerably wealthier and more powerful.  Given all this, and the fact permanent members of the Security Council have veto powers, the introduction of sanctions seems a long way off. That said, history shows us that the Security Council and particularly the permanent members can rapidly change their position in response to a global event. Could climate change constitute such an event? Maybe, one day. Brazil’s actions indirectly undermine the stability and sovereignty of countries most affected by climate breakdown, and so, yes, sanctions are severe, but they are proportionate. Crucially they might encourage the Brazilian government to rethink its policy on deforestation."

With Tuesday’s election widely predicted to bring a near‐​historic shake‐​up of the political establishment, here are some things we can say for certain even before the first results are tallied: 
"
"

On March 5th 2019 retiring National MP Nathan Guy, rose in the House of Parliament to ask a question of government minister Damien O’Connor: “Does he stand by his statement last year to _Rural News_ that when it comes to increasing costs on farmers, they should—and I’ll quote—”get used to it”?



O’Connor replied: “Our government is clearly committed to increase water quality **, to commit to climate change international obligations** …”



That very same, sad, day one of New Zealand’s very best scientists escaped this mortal prison. David Kear was a genius, a pragmatic, problem-solving genius. London-born, he became interested in New Zealand during time spent aboard HM(NZ)S ‘Achilles’ 1942-44, and interested in geology from time spent in a Welsh coal-mine ‘never wishing to go underground again’. He would emigrate to God’s Own Country with his beautiful new wife after the war.



On a ‘hunch’ he almost single-handedly launched New Zealand’s steel industry after years of efforts by teams of other talented geotechnical experts had proved fruitless. We owe him plenty, just last year our exports of steel totalled nearly half-a-billion dollars, despite our current prime minister’s attempts to disadvantage us in the field.



Mr Kear was recognised for his ability during his lifetime, rising to become head of the internationally recognised DSIR. He was much more than fossil analysist or cross-strata projection theorist, much more involved than our far-removed department-heads of today; he felt science on, and in, the world that surrounds us.



David held the view that ‘global-warming’ theory was an abuse of the scientific method, and he held those views strongly[, as strongly as his hunch](https://royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-people/our-fellows/obituaries/fellows-obituaries/david-kear/)



that such a deposit [of ironsand with over 80 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate close to suitable transport] might be found on a raised interglacial terrace, but be covered by recent dune-sand. 



His logic proved correct, and a suitable deposit was subsequently proved up by drilling at Waikato North Head. Finding a suitable site with solid foundations for the steel mill itself was more difficult because of the widespread presence of peat in the Waikato Valley. Using geological maps, David found a suitable site at Glenbrook on old lava flows.



In some ways David Kear is New Zealand’s Benjamin Franklin; using his accumulated knowledge and individual genius to the betterment of every single person in this society, asking nothing in return.



He became strongly disabused of ‘climate science’ as early as 1985:



“ I noted the words “ **Global Warming** ” appearing increasingly in paper titles, and sensed a growing number of adherents. Those latter arranged a first-ever “Conference on Global Warming” in Vienna in 1985. Unlike most such meetings, where a communiqué summarising achievements was released on the final day, the full results of this one were **delayed for over 2 years.**



When they did appear (front page, _NZ Herald_ , two days before Christmas 1987) a _World Declaration_ included “Overseas scientists have estimated that the seas around New Zealand will rise by up to 1.4 m in the next 40 years”. That article concentrated on the massive consequent problems, caused by our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, **but gave no adequate supporting science.** That rate of rise was equivalent to _3,500_ mm/century, 28 times faster than our _125_ mm ** _._** Hence **we stupidly ignored it, thinking no one could possibly believe it. But the World did believe, and the Global Warming mirage was born.** Had _3,500_ been true, sea level should have risen by almost 1 m by today – it hasn’t, not even closely.”



David was deeply concerned, and extremely disappointed, by the half-truths on display:



“There can be no doubt that to ensure their 1987 World Declaration made the greatest impact, they published the maximum value – **contravening the most sacred rule of acceptable science:** **_Thou shall not publish items_** _for monetary, political, or personal gain **that are not clear un-biased un-inflated truths.** ”_



On Wednesday, August 14th NZ Steel announced it may be impractical to consider future steel-making in New Zealand due to its reliance on coal which not only fuels the plant but is vital to the steel-making process; reliant as it is on the carbon-rich fuel’s chemical interaction with ore to produce a high-quality resultant product. Anyone who understands the important difference between iron and steel knows this already but the general public and the current government have no clue whatsoever. Hence:



David would be dismayed that the industry he helped found and which has helped so many towards homes, livelihoods and opportunities, would be disintegrated with 2,500 (at least) jobs lost for mere political opportunism and make-believe science manufactured to feed a media narrative.



It’s an indictment on society that the words of such a talented man, a man we truly owe so much for his contribution, are so hard to find (funny, that) but you can read them for [yourself here](https://www.nzcpr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Global-Warming-Dr-David-Kear.pdf) if you dare, (you may be discouraged by several banners warning of ‘harmful’ content).



Rest in peace; humble Mr David Kear. The world, especially this part of it, is worse-off without you.



I salute you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVarious reports are coming out claiming that Russian authorities have reduced the charges against the Arctic Sunrise activists from piracy to hooliganism.
Russia’s RT here reports the lesser hooliganism charge carries a maximum sentence of 7 years in prison.
‘The actions of those involved in the criminal case have been  reclassified to the charge of hooliganism,’ the spokesman for  the Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, told the RIA  Novosti news agency.”
There seem to be conflicting claims on how long the activists may have to spend time in jail if convicted of hooliganism. CTV news here reports that the charge carries 15 days in prison only.
The piracy charges carry a 15-year prison term, while hooliganism is usually punished by 15 days in jail or a fine.”
That is likely very inaccurate. Back in the 1980s a young nutjob German pilot Matthias Rust famously flew his small Cessna through then Soviet airspace and landed on Red Square in Moscow, embarrassing the Soviet empire. For that deed he was, according to Wikipedia, “sentenced to four years in a general-regime labor camp for hooliganism, disregard of aviation laws and breaching of the Soviet border. He was never transferred to a labor camp and instead served his time at the high security Lefortovo temporary detention facility in Moscow. Two months later, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to sign a treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, and the Supreme Soviet ordered Rust to be released in August 1988 as a goodwill gesture to the West.”
Should the activists be convicted of hooliganism, they’ll probably be sentenced to a couple of years and be out within a year or so. That probably won’t be long enough to teach a number of them a lesson. In fact, expect them to be given a hero’s welcome when they return. Barf! gag!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow often have we heard the alarmists say “one cold winter is not climate” but then claim that a single tornado or a few days of hot weather are ominous signs of global warming?
Yesterday the German Press Agency (DPA) had an interview with Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research climate scientist Prof. Friedrich-Wilhelm Gerstengarbe. The subject: two short heat waves that occurred in Germany this month, and another three or four-day hot spell set to start tomorrow. Is this a sign of climate change?, the DPA asks.
What’s a bit surprising is alarmist Gerstengarbe’s reply: no.
Specifically the DPA asks:
Are the heat waves an indication for global warming?

Gerstengarbe responds:
A single heat wave is absolutely no sign of a climate change. We’ve had them before, and we will have them in the future. Heat waves are part of weather occurrences, but they are only a very small piece of the puzzle. Weather is always a part of the climate history. However, you have to be careful not to draw conclusions based on one extreme event.”
This of course does not mean that Gerstengarbe and the PIK have scaled back their hysteria. Quite to the contrary, Gerstengarbe cites other extreme events and the melting Arctic sea ice, but conveniently ignoring all the evidence contradicting the warming, i.e. 15 years of no global temperature increase, growing Antarctic sea ice, 5 consecutive cold winters in a row, etc.
It’s no surprise that the PIK continues its brand of hysterical alarmism – it’s supported by the world’s largest reinsurer against global catastrophes: The Munich Re. The intense alarmism yields hefty profits for the Munich Re, which needs a “scientific basis” to justify jacking up the premiums it charges clients and its huge profits.
Reinsurer Munich Re is even a contributor to the latest IPCC report, which is due to be released in September. So profitable can alarmism be.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWell it looks like journalists are willing to go only so far when it comes to carrying water for Germany’s powerful Church Ministry of Environment, which oversees the Umweltbundesamt (UBA).

The German Association of Journalists Chairman Michael Konken calls the UBA’s defamatory pamphlet targeting US and German journalists and scientists “unacceptable” and demands an apology from Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier. Photo credit: DJV; photographer: Anja Cord
The UBA under Angela Merkel’s Ministry of Environment, which is directed by Peter Altmaier, recently published a highly controversial pamphlet that black-listed climate-science dissident German and US journalists and scientists. Now the German Association of Journalists (DJV) has responded and issued a press release:
Ministry Brands Critics 
 The German Association of Journalists DJV rejects Ministry of Environment’s recent criticism of individual journalists, calling it excessive and unfounded.
The state officials in their pamphlet titled ‘Und sie erwärmt sich doch’ [And indeed the warming continues] singled out and named a number of journalists who had made critical statements about the climate prognoses of the Umweltbundesamt [Federal Environment Agency]. Their media reports ‘did not conform to the state of climate knowledge,’ the pamphlet stated on page 112. Then the journalists and the media outlets for whom they publish were then named. Among those named are the former editor in chief of the magazine Natur and an editor at Focus. ‘The text passages read in a way that make the journalists appear as incompetent and as if they are being pilloried said DJV Federal Chairman Michael Konken. ‘That is not acceptable.’ 
A state agency in Germany does not have the authority to brand critics of government policy as heretics, said Konken. He is now requesting German Environment Minister Peter Altmaier to stop the distribution of the brochure in its current form and to apologise to the journalists named in the pamphlet.
Tel. 030/72 62 79 20, Fax 030/726 27 92 13
I think the apology needs to come from Flasbarth himself as well. Now the blame is being unfairly shifted to Altmaier. Not only should Flasbarth apologise, but he should also  resign. Clearly he lost control of the agency. The whole UBA is nothing more than a nest of environmental zealots, if the pamphlet is anything to go by.

NoTricksZone is something I do on the side as a hobby. One I admit that has consumed far more time than I ever bargained for and has morphed into an unshakable obligation to write a post every day. It is something I really enjoy doing. And unlike many of the warmist blogs out there, I receive no donations at all from anyone. It’s just me speaking out.
According to Google Analytics, yesterday the NTZ site surpassed the 5 million page views mark since the blog’s very humble beginnings in April, 2010. Of course I’m nowhere near sites like What’s Up With That, but the current level of interest is something I never expected to see. Currently the NTZ site is getting between 180,000 to 200,000 views per month from over 100 countries globally. In fact in the three years that NTZ has been operating, it has seen readers from every country in the world – except North Korea and NASA.
To be fair, I think NASA in the meantime has lifted its silly ban.
I also wish to thank a number of other sites who often link to NTZ: Climate Depot, WUWT, Tom Nelson, climategate.nl, climatescam.se, EIKE, Bishop Hill, junkscience.com, Die kalte Sonne.de, and others. Hopefully no one will feel left out if I didn’t mention you. Success without you would never have been possible. No one achieves success alone. Here, nothing works better than a free market that is guided by compassion, truth, and concern for the environment.

I keep telling myself to slow down to 5 posts a week and to take the weekends off, something my wife would appreciate, but stories just keep popping up and I feel they need to be put out there.
I’m always welcoming posts by guest authors, and so if you have a story and want to give it a try, send it over. Try to keep it below 500 words and down to 3 or 4 graphics. You can send it over as a Word file.
Thanks for reading and I hope you’ll keep dropping by.
Stay warm!

 **Dr Don Brash  
** Founding Member  
[Free Speech Coalition](https://www.freespeechcoalition.nz/donate?utm_campaign=190910_don_brash_ask&utm_medium=email&utm_source=freespeech)



As you know, last week the Free Speech Coalition were finally in court – standing up to the ‘thug’s veto’ enabled by Phil Goff and Auckland Council caving into protesters who threatened to disrupt a totally legal speaking event that was scheduled at a Council-owned venue.



 **But without any sense of irony, a comedian whose career has been based on jokes about racial stereotypes was leading the charge against us.** Apparently we picked the wrong cause…



In an opinion piece published across New Zealand in _Stuff_ newspapers, comedian Raybon Kan opined:



 ** _Don’t help white supremacists by fighting their legal battles_**



 _I’m not against free speech. That would be odd for a comedian. What I’m against is the Free Speech Coalition._



It is amazing how many people say they ‘support free speech’ but…



 _A year ago, when Canadian white supremacist trolls Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern were denied a venue booking by Auckland City Council, the Free Speech Coalition’s response wasn’t to giggle, or applaud, or high-five. Instead, this brought the Free Speech Coalition into existence. Politically disparate individuals – well-known, educated people – suddenly danced in sync, a flashmob, assembling as if Avengers for the Canadian pair._



The first of many errors. It wasn’t that the council wouldn’t take the booking, **the council de-platformed** the Canadians after “Auckland Peace Action” kicked up a fuss and the Mayor got involved.



 _Don Brash. Chris Trotter. Stephen Franks. Jordan Williams. Lindsay Perigo. Paul Moon. Ashley Church. David Cumin. Melissa Derby. Rachel Poulain. I hope I didn’t leave anyone out._



 _Literally overnight, these people managed to find each other’s phone numbers, incorporate an organisation, hire a web developer, open a bank account, and set up a crowdfunding site – all to raise money to sue Auckland Council over a couple of cackling white supremacists. Overnight._



This ‘name and shame’ tar brush of ‘white supremacy’ isn’t even advocacy. I am proud that a dozen or so of us got together for a worthy cause, and that such a broad range of Kiwis have financially supported the coalition and made this work possible.



 _To the Free Speech Coalition, a venue cancellation for white supremacists was a moral emergency. It couldn’t think of anything more urgent._



 _The coalition didn’t spend this time making a sandwich for a homeless person. It didn’t plant a tree._



 _It didn’t even bake a cake, just so a dog nearby could perk up at the scent. Instead, the group went and bought fresh art supplies to paint a dollar-sign smile on the faces of white supremacists._



 _In my view, the Free Speech Coalition would have contributed more to society, this entire year, if it had just got in a room, cranked up Pornhub, and gone for it ambidextrously till exhaustion._



Unlike Raybon Kan, you and I understand that this issue was never about the controversial speakers. I can honestly say that I had never even heard of Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern prior to Phil Goff getting up on his high horse and claiming that he had banned them.



 **The Free Speech Coalition and the litigation effort was always about protecting the principle: we can’t let the protesting mob, or opportunistic politicians, be the decision-makers about who you and I can (and cannot) hear from.**



 _Let’s talk about free speech. Fine, OK, whatever – racists, white supremacists, Nazis – they probably, maybe, do have the right to free speech._



 _But don’t tell them that. And certainly don’t pay a lawyer to tell them that._



 _Helpful tip: whenever the opportunity arises to be of assistance to white supremacists, look away, cough, and cross the street. That’s the least you can do, morally._



This is the cheap shot in the article. **The whole point of defending free speech is defending the rights of the very speakers you do not necessarily agree with, or even find repugnant. Otherwise, you’re not really defending free speech at all.**



Raybon goes on:



 _[…] On TV, Chris Trotter quoted Voltaire: “I find what you say repugnant, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”_



 _I say: pick something better to die for. The Amazon is on fire. Kids are hungry. Berms need mowing. My to-do list is a three-volume trilogy, and even so, the financial and emotional sponsorship of white supremacists doesn’t quite make the cut._



 _If you find someone’s views repugnant, don’t help them plug in speakers and turn up the volume._



 _If you find someone’s views repugnant, don’t buy them ink to print out their manifesto._



 _Don’t search for the most repugnant deplorables, to lend them moral support._



 _Don’t make their victory your victory._



 _Pick a side.[…]_



Radio NZ’s coverage of the court case was equally disappointing in playing the politics rather than the principle. Having sat in court for two days listening to interesting legal arguments, our state broadcaster took similarly cheap shots:



 ** _NZ’s right-wing turn up in force for controversial free speech case_**



 _For the past two days room eight in Auckland’s High Court has been home to some of the country’s notable right-wing figures, who are bent on affirming the speaking rights of two controversial Canadians._



 _The man behind the Orewa speech, Don Brash, made an appearance yesterday, and Jordan Williams from the Taxpayers’ Union has been listening intently in the public gallery, a few seats down from a man in a MAGA (Make Ardern Go Away) hat._



 _Old Conservative Party leader Colin Craig also poked his head around the door at one point, although he was in the building for another reason – to face defamation action brought by a former party colleague._



 _On the court documents, University of Auckland anaesthesiology lecturer David Cumin is listed as one applicant, would-be Dunedin Mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer Malcolm Moncrief-Spittle the other._



So what? If someone was taking objection to Raybon Kan’s jokes about race, it would probably be left-wing figures at the back of the court. And of course, I am taking a keen interest in this case – I was stopped from speaking at Massey University on the same sort of ‘health and safety’ ~~excuses~~ grounds that the Auckland council and mayor are trying to use.



As you can see we’re up against a media and establishment that just don’t get it. They prefer cheap shots to try and bully and marginalise our cause, because they are confident (I would argue, very naively!) that they themselves will not be in the gun. 



**So protecting free speech relies on our work continuing and your financial support so the Free Speech Coalition can continue to fight for free speech in New Zealand.** We will even stand up for people we disagree with – like Raybon Kan.



 **So I am asking you to take up Raybon’s invitation at the end of his article and pick a side.**

“Drain the swamp!” was a powerful rallying cry during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The businessman promised to govern in the public interest, and end the revolving door between politics and lobbying. If anyone had the chance to overturn special carve‐​outs, subsidies, regulatory barriers and access generated by special pleading, it was surely a wealthy populist insurgent unbeholden to major donors.



Yet eight months in to the Trump presidency, there appears to be little momentum behind his pledge to overhaul the relationship between big vested interests and the US government. A poll in late May found that 32 per cent of voters thought Trump had made the swamp worse, against 24 per cent who saw improvement. More worryingly, the President’s arbitrary conduct risks exacerbating crony capitalism in future.



The first ominous signs came with Trump’s cabinet selection. Appointing a former CEO of Exxon Mobile to head the State Department, a former Goldman Sachs partner to the Treasury, the daughter of a shipping company magnate to the Transportation department and an investor in steel, automotive components and coal to Commerce, hardly screamed an intent to break links between business and government.





Eight months in to the Trump presidency, there appears to be little momentum behind his pledge to overhaul the relationship between big vested interests and the US government.



Assigning conventional politicians to other positions did little to suggest major change was coming, either. A Newsweek analysis found that approximately 70 per cent of Trump’s White House staff were working in DC before the start of the administration too.



Trump’s picks for key government agencies likewise raised eyebrows. Professor Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business has highlighted how the lawyer Walter Clayton was appointed as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, having previously represented many major Wall Street firms in fraud cases — and despite being married to another Goldman Sachs employee.



True, one of Trump’s early executive orders sought to stop a “revolving door” by preventing administration employees from taking up lobbying posts for five years after their government jobs, and for government employees to recuse themselves from actions that affect their former employers. But this did not go anywhere near as far as Trump had promised.



In a Wisconsin rally last October, he pledged to oversee similar legislation applied to Congress too. He also promised campaign finance reform to prevent foreign lobbyists from raising money in US elections. No such legislation has been forthcoming.



What about policy? The Trump administration had a real opportunity to end government‐​granted regulatory, spending and tax privileges. But little progress has been made here either.



Trump has used a host of executive orders to set frameworks to constrain the growth of regulation, and the Congressional Review Act to eliminate many rules passed under Barack Obama. Though an imperfect measure, there are some indications this is working. In May, the Federal Register for 2017 stood at around 20,000 pages (which would imply a level around 62,000 for the full year). This was much lower than whopping 95,894 of 2016 under President Obama.



A substantial deregulatory effort could theoretically help reduce cronyism by reducing the scope of regulation that can be shaped by special interests. In fact, reducing the size and scope of government more broadly can eliminate many specific perks and instances of favouritism towards certain sectors. Trump’s recent budget showed this, and he is to be commended for proposing cuts, for example, to farm subsidies, which are perhaps the most egregious form of privilege with concentrated benefits and diffused costs across taxpayers.



Yet the President could be going much further to eliminate government involvement with business.



One obvious example is Trump’s flip‐​flop on the Export‐​Import bank — the pinnacle of corporate cronyism. As a candidate, Trump pledged to dissolve the bank, which divvies out loan guarantees and direct taxpayer funds to facilitate the exports of some of the US’s biggest companies, such as Boeing and General Electric. But in office, the President appears to have been nobbled by its beneficiaries. He now claims it is vital for them to have access to this kind of export finance.



On trade, Trump has been more consistently anti‐​market. But more protectionist measures, particularly those designed to insulate the US steel industry, will adversely affect consumers and downstream industries in order to protect one of the President’s favoured sectors. Worse, they will embolden other sectors facing strong foreign competition to lobby the government for similar treatment, exacerbating cronyism.



That is not to say that all of Trump’s actions reflect a desire to favour corporate interests. One certainly could not accuse Trump of listening to big business in his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement — a decision which brought a stinging rebuke from a range of company heads and industries keen on the deal, and the loss of Tesla’s Elon Musk and Disney’s Robert Iger from his business panel.



But the President’s failure to take a principled, consistent position on the role of government in business means that these individual decisions tend to come with strong assumptions about motive. If Trump thinks protecting steel is acceptable, then it is understandable why others believe his decision on Paris reflects a desire to protect fossil fuels.



While the effect of Trump’s policies on the swamp are ambiguous, his personal conduct is surely deepening it.



The principle that companies should be treated equally under the law, and that government should avoid picking winners and losers, is a mainstay of market economy. But even prior to coming to office, Trump used the bully pulpit of his Twitter account to praise Ford for a decision not to build a new plant in Mexico, alongside tweets which warned ominously that companies that “want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again”.



He and his team seemingly changed the business decision of United Technologies, which cancelled plans to move a plant to Mexico, through a range of proposed US tax incentives and implicit threats to some of the company’s revenues from government contracts. The stock prices of other businesses have risen or fallen based on Trump’s musings on Twitter. Just last week, Trump and the White House made lots of noise about the Foxconn plans in Wisconsin.



As a candidate, Trump threatened Amazon with antitrust action, following critical coverage of him in the _Washington Post_ (owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos). More recently, there have been strong indications that the Trump team are using implicit threats against CNN by hinting at interventions in the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner (CNN’s parent company). All that is not to mention the shameless use of public office to boost the value of Trump properties, and the use of Mar‐​a‐​Lago as a means of access to the President.



This behaviour all threatens worsening crony capitalism, because companies will be more likely to base their business decisions according to expected political reaction rather than servicing consumer demand. Innovation and entrepreneurial activity will be less likely — the easier path for big business will be to become a “favourite” of the administration. Already we have seen instances of this politicisation, with companies re‐​releasing job announcements to seek the President’s approval and recipients of Export‐​Import bank funds justifying them using Trump’s protectionist language.



As business becomes politicised, the incentive to invest more in lobbying, government relations and political donations to meet the demands and desires of government, rather than consumers, will be irresistible. And if the electors perceive the negative results of this cronyism to be a consequence of enterprise rather than political failure, government control will ratchet up further.



Of course, the Trump presidency has a long way to run. The Republican Congress and White House could eliminate many of the opportunities for cronyism by shrinking regulatory agencies, and ending direct government subsidies. But judged so far on his government construction, policies and conduct, it is difficult to conclude that Trump is “draining the swamp”.

If Jacinda Ardern thought Scott Morrison was going to be intimidated by her and her little friends’ mean-girl bullying act at the Pacific Islands Forum, she was sorely disappointed. In contrast to Ardern’s constant posturing for applause from the globalist peanut gallery at the UN, Morrison reminded her of what a national leader’s first duty should be.



 **“I’m accountable to the Australian ­people, that’s who I’m accountable for,” he said.**



Scott Morrison stared down Jacinda Ardern and 16 other leaders at the Pacific Island Forum last night, refusing to back a statement that would obligate Australia to end coalmining and go carbon-neutral by 2050.



“Carbon neutral” is the most blatant scam in the entire climate medicine show. Just like the Kyoto Protocol, it’s a load of snake-oil cooked up by hucksters bent on distracting the gawping rubes on the benches while their pockets are picked. Pledges of “carbon neutrality” are made by lying shills who weight the dice by strategically omitting some of the biggest CO2 sources, and who know in any case that they will be long out of office by the time their deceit is laid bare. For all its virtue-signalling, Kyoto did nothing to reduce emissions. Even high priest of climate alarmism James Hansen calls it a “farce”. But the leaders who signed it are all out of office and safely beyond being held to account.



Jacinda Ardern can make all the b.s. promises she likes, because she knows that she will be nothing but a footnote by 2050. Her “carbon neutral” pledge should be taken no more seriously than her Kiwibuild promises.



As for the tub-thumping Pacific leaders, the hollowness of their rhetoric is belied by their own reliance on fossil fuels. Let’s see them call for a ban on international flights or fossil-fuelled cruise ships.



They ought also to beware that their “gibsmedat”, Cargo Cult greed will come back to bite them, very hard.



There are mounting fears that China will seek to take advantage of the backlash against Australia at the forum…US Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt will also address the forum, warning that Pacific ­nations risk losing their political and economic sovereignty if they shift closer to China.



Of all people, Ardern’s puppet master is shaping up as an unlikely realist.



In a conciliatory move yesterday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters retreated from his Prime Minister’s challenge to Mr Morrison, saying Pacific­­ ­nations needed to look at the big picture, including China’s “coal-fired everything”.



Mr Peters told ABC radio he was worried there was a perception that Mr Morrison was “somehow acting incorrectly”.



“There’s a big picture we have to contemplate where we have to ensure that when we act in this big picture, we act with consistency and integrity,” he said.



When Jacinda Ardern hears the word “consistency”, she reaches for the picture-dictionary. When she hears “integrity”, she throws it in the bin (recycling, of course).

"Every few years the ideals of Ebenezer Howard’s garden city utopia are resurrected in an attempt by the UK government to create new communities, and address the country’s housing crisis. Sometimes this takes the form of new towns or eco-towns, and sometimes proposals for an actual garden city are put forward – as in the last budget.  Rather than just rolling out this romantic terminology, we should take a closer look at garden city ideals and how they can be adopted to make the proposed Ebbsfleet development a success. Several years ago my colleague Michael Edwards presciently forecast the current problems in the Thames Gateway where Ebbsfleet falls, with a dominance of private development that does little to provide for local employment and walkable communities. He outlined the need to return to funding principles similar to the garden city model, where development trusts retain freeholds on the land. This model, based on investment in infrastructure and services, is a fundamental principle that shifts from short-term returns to a long-term relationship created between the collective or public landowner and local inhabitants.  Despite the fact that the garden city was a highly influential model throughout the first half of the 20th century, ultimately leading to the establishment of some key settlements in the UK, US and elsewhere in the world, it has had few genuine successes. After World War II, similar utopian dreams of creating model communities, with decent housing surrounding a well-designed centre, met with the reality. British reformer William Beveridge famously summed them up for having “no gardens, few roads, no shops and a sea of mud”. You’d be forgiven for thinking that past lessons would be applied to the next generation of housing. But, even the post-war housing plans – though inspired by the garden city movement of the interwar periods – failed to plan the new housing in relation to transport, employment and public services such as shops and schools. While UK government reports have tried to draw lessons from both their positive and negative aspects, they have also been criticised in more recent reports, for lacking a sense of community – although it should also be said that “community” takes time to develop and cannot be “designed” as such. Many of the challenges of creating new communities are bound up in the spatial separation between newcomers and older inhabitants, a lack of social infrastructure, such as doctor’s surgeries and schools, and difficulties that stem from long commutes, such as lower net income and the strain this has on families. Ruth Durant found this in her 1939 study of Burnt Oak on the outskirts of London.  Early post-war new towns were similarly criticised for their very slow build-up of health services, higher schooling, cultural facilities and decent shopping facilities, although some did better with the provision of local employment, due to many people moving to the towns with a local job linked to their housing. With shifts in the industrial economy, such beneficial connections between home and work (one of the tenets of the garden city) reduced over time. The challenges today are slightly different, however. People live more mobile and fragmented lives and are arguably less likely to be tied to place as was the case for the primarily working-class (and manual labouring) communities of the past. This poses the risk that community will be lost because of how transient people can be. But increased mobility and social interaction don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Indeed, a lack of mobility is the worst problem that can be imposed on a community: both work and leisure must be accessible to people. Plus, with the advent of the internet and grass-roots activism, connections can traverse space more easily. This has allowed movements such as the Transition Network, which brings communities together around sustainable issues, to blossom. UCL’s EPSRC funded Adaptable Suburbs project has studied the evolution of London’s outer suburban towns over the past 150 years, providing some clues on what has made for the relative success of the original garden cities over other planned settlements. It is clear that their success has been dependent on excellent transport connections, coupled with the provision of local employment and access to employment at a commutable distance.  Also important is the provision of a mixed-use town centre, giving a destination for a wide variety of activities in addition to retail: community activities, schools, leisure and cultural uses. Centres work well when connected to the street network, accessible by foot, bicycle, public and private transport. This multi-functional design has helped even the smallest of centres to sustain themselves through the most recent economic recession. A recent government report, “Understanding High Street Performance”, also found that successful town centres are “characterised by considerable diversity and complexity, in terms of scale, geography and catchment, function and form … [as] a result, the way in which they are affected by and respond to change is diverse and varied”.  It is almost impossible to predict how society will change in the future, particularly as new technologies have the power to change how people connect and build community. But what is evident is that here lies another essential aspect of building successful communities: in allowing for places to adapt to change.  This needs to be a foundational aspect of the government’s new cities – simply invoking the phrase “garden city” is not enough. By building places with sufficient flexibility of buildings, infrastructure and uses, coupled with links that allow for local and wider-scale trips to take place, with the necessary long-term financial investment, we can start to create places that will successfully weather the future."

"**The UK's high level of obesity has fuelled a much-increased death rate from Covid-19, says the former chief medical officer for England.**
Prof Dame Sally Davies said high obesity rates - and high levels of deprivation and overcrowded housing - had cost lives.
The poor state of public health meant it was not surprising that the UK had struggled during the pandemic.
Dame Sally called for tougher policies to combat obesity.
She said: ""The fact that we are one of the fattest nations in the developed world has undoubtedly led to more deaths than we should have had.
""Our poor public health - whether it is deprivation, overweight, or other chronic illnesses, alongside crowding in urban areas - have led to a much increased death rate over what we could have had if we had a healthier basic population.""
The UK became the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths earlier this month.
Dame Sally said stricter recent restrictions had reduced social encounters and so brought down coronavirus infections.
But she added that she expected a third wave of the virus, possibly in the New Year, and that it was going to be a difficult winter.
Dame Sally left her role as the government's chief medical adviser to become head of Cambridge University's Trinity College a few months before Covid-19 struck.
She has co-authored a book arguing for more effective measures to promote healthier living. Among the measures she supports are taxes on foods high in salt or sugar.
She said: ""It is incontrovertible that if you are overweight - particularly if you are obese - you increase your risk of death.
""All of the diseases associated with overweight, whether it is hypertension, diabetes or others, increase the risk of getting very ill.
""Clearly it is terribly important that we sort out obesity and overweight to improve the health of the nation.""
She said that while average life expectancy in the UK had increased, the average number of years of healthy life had not, and among the most deprived sections of the population it had come down.
The UK government unveiled a plan to tackle rates of obesity in July, which included a ban on ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food in England, restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus.
There will also be a national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily, a consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether, and a review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops.
Dame Sally Davies has made very few comments about the Covid-19 pandemic.
She has been understandably keen not to tread on the toes of her successor Chris Whitty.
She knows that any future review of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis will partly cover her time as chief medical adviser.
But she has always been passionate about the need to improve health and wellbeing and implement tough anti-obesity policies.
So her broader arguments about the vulnerability of the UK population to Covid because of long-standing structural health inequalities is consistent with her stated views when in Whitehall.
It is a sobering thought that more people died in the UK with coronavirus than in many other leading industrialised nations because of poor underlying health.
Dame Sally has the issue out there for others to consider as they look for lessons to be learned. With her put stature and experience, the message cannot be ignored."

For another shot at government, the Greens will need to convince the average New Zealander, particularly the targeted first time voter, that they are more than Morris dancers, mohair jacket wearers and tree-huggers. Undoubtedly these misguided souls are part of their support base but they really are best kept hidden away from Joe Public.



Media were barred from members’ meetings at the Greens’ annual conference, but James Shaw and Marama Davidson appeared on The Nation at the weekend, attempting to present as a united front. **They failed.** Shaw made absolutely no eye contact at all with Davidson during the entire interview. At best he looked very stiff and awkward.



When asked how their co-leadership is working, Davidson assured us she has a long, good working relationship with Shaw and they “take turns” in heading up “different, complementary” roles in the responsibility of the Green party leadership. “Explaining is losing”, though, as one well-known media commentator so wisely puts it.



Shaw was asked why he didn’t support Davidson at Ihum&amacrtao and said “I had a series of ministerial appointments” after Simon Shepherd had already told him “there was nothing in the ministerial media diary, I checked.” Shaw then paused, ummed and aahed, finally saying “Well, I had work on.” He was not convincing.



The Green leadership may not be united in protesting at Ihum&amacrtao, but they claim a reprieve by saying that their government support is limited to the confidence and supply agreement. 



Apparently, though, they are united on climate change, clean rivers and on achieving a rental warrant of fitness, guaranteed tenancies for renters and a rent-to-own scheme. Having already put enough pressure on the rental market to scare away private investors, it seems Davidson is also a very slow learner.



Wallpapering over the cracks in the Greens’ leadership is a temporary fix at best. Of more concern is that Davidson is already firmly ensconced in the **lunatic fringe element** of the Greens. These are the people who should remain hidden lest they scare off the new punters. Watch this space for a bust-up in the Greens’ leadership before the next election.



Unless she turns over a new leaf, Davidson’s history of trying to reclaim the “C” word and protesting as a radical foreshadows a short career in politics. Shaw should cut her loose before his party loses any more ground to the loonies on the left. Don’t worry James – being called sexist and racist is far better than jeopardising the future of the party.

"A cross-society collection of groups – representing business, the energy industry, property owners, unions, major investors, disadvantaged people and the environment – have banded together to warn that Australia’s prosperity depends on eradicating greenhouse gas emissions. In a letter to the national cabinet, federal and state energy ministers and Nev Power, Scott Morrison’s handpicked Covid-19 recovery chairman, the 14 organisations have called for government support in the wake of the pandemic to urgently stimulate job growth and rebuild a “sustainable and strong economy”.  They say it should include measures to cut emissions and accelerate a transition to clean energy across all regions and economic sectors, and recommend a focus on fixing inefficient homes and buildings. Signatories to the letter, sent on 15 May, include the heads of the Business Council, the Property Council, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Industry Group, the ACTU, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Australian Conservation Foundation. “Australia faces a public health emergency with immediate economic impacts as well as longer-lasting global economic pain. Beyond the pandemic, Australian prosperity also depends on dealing with other long-term challenges, including the transition to net zero emissions,” the letter says. It can bee seen as part of a growing global call for governments to respond to the economic shock of the pandemic with policies that also help tackle the climate crisis. The federal government continues to reject a 2050 target of net zero emissions and is developing a roadmap for emissions reduction that suggests a major role for gas, a fossil fuel, alongside hydrogen, renewable energy and, potentially, nuclear power. The National Covid-19 Coordination Commission is heavily backing gas to drive the economic recovery. The groups say there are many opportunities to cut emissions, but single out energy efficiency and management. They call for government support for upgrades across private and public housing, commercial, community and government buildings and industrial facilities. Suggested improvements include more efficient and controllable appliances and equipment, improved “thermal envelopes” – walls, roofs, floors and windows – and shading, introducing smart meters to better manage electricity use across the day and an expanded roll-out of solar panels and home batteries. The letter cites the International Energy Agency as highlighting that energy efficiency upgrades are “job-intensive and strongly support economic stimulus goals”. “In Australia, a major drive to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and industry could deliver over 120,000 job-years of employment,” it says. “If done well, these investments would durably lower energy bills; ease strains on a rapidly changing energy system; improve health and safety during increasingly hot summers; boost the competitiveness of local manufacturers, whose value to Australia is clearer than ever; enable deeper emissions cuts – and sustain activity across a broad range of trades and industries.” A report released last month by ClimateWorks Australia on how to decarbonise the country found the technology for zero-emissions buildings already existed, and much of it was simple. Steps would or could involve improving insulation and draught sealing, installing LED lighting, solar hot water and better appliances and introducing passive house design standards. It would require shifting from gas-fired heating and cooking to running on clean energy. A separate study by Beyond Zero Emissions, another not-for-profit group, has estimated there could be more than 300,000 jobs in a national “deep energy retrofit” drive to improve the efficiency of 3m buildings across the country, starting with social housing, low-income homes, schools and hospitals, to a point where they no longer face quarterly electricity or gas bills. The letter to governments says potential templates for publicly funded efficiency drives include the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s support for the construction of hundreds of 7-star affordable housing units in Sydney, and a 2017 energy upgrade that cut energy use at the MCG by 24%, saving enough power to run more than 1,800 homes. It says governments should look for other climate-friendly options that can support economic recovery and energy transition, including integrating recovery plans with long-term emissions reduction strategies and plans for modernising power grids, carbon farming and bushfire recovery. Other signatories are the heads of WWF, the Energy Users Association, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Carbon Market Institute and the Energy Efficiency Council."
"Hunched against the wind in Tasmania’s central highlands are the floral relics of the last ice age. Walking among them, armed with a large pole and a cloth bag, is James Wood, the coordinator of the Tasmanian seed bank. It is the first time in five years that Tasmania’s 1,000-year-old conifers have seeded, and he is determined not to miss it. It is the third week of April. A coronavirus outbreak has occurred in Tasmania’s north-west, causing the premier to close two regional hospitals and place 5,000 health workers and their families in quarantine. And Wood is walking a deserted stretch of the Overland Track, alone but for Justin Dyer, his guide from the Tasmanian Walking Company, in search of stands of pencil pines, or Athrotaxis cupressoides.  On an ordinary day, the Overland Track carries 60 hikers. But the national parks are closed and travel banned due to the coronavirus, so for five days Wood and Dyer see no one except for a few park rangers, dozens of pademelons (a squat, short-tailed wallaby) and a hungry platypus that ignored them in favour of hunting in a tarn, two humans being no competition to the lure of a full belly. “It was just incredibly quiet,” Wood says. “You do get this feeling of real privilege that you’re getting that place pretty much to yourself.” The pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania’s high country, the most well-known of which are king billy pines (Athrotaxis selaginoides). They are the last remnants of the Gondwana forest, from a genus that is at least 150m years old. The trees are not listed as threatened because they are not uncommon within their ecosystems, but that could change any given summer. Stands of pencil pines and cheshunt pines at Lake Mackenzie were destroyed when a fire raced down the Devil’s Gullet in 2016. Stands of king billy pines were also lost. “The reality is that if fire frequency increases in these upland areas, and that seems very likely, that could change very quickly,” Wood says. “So what we are trying to do here is act preemptively and get seed collections in place when we can.” The Tasmanian pines are more dispersed and their habitat wilder, making a rescue effort like that which saved the ancient Wollomi pines in the New South Wales Blue Mountains this summer more difficult. “It does make them very vulnerable,” Wood says. Pencil pines and other Athrotaxis produce seeds only every few years, as part of a global masting event that triggers sudden seed production in unrelated plants around the world. The last masting event was in 2015. The trigger, says Wood, appears to be two successively hotter summers, although there’s no consensus on the exact cause. This year the seeding was “patchy”, with pencil pines on higher and drier areas not producing pine cones, and cheshunt pines, which often grow nearby, not seeding at all. It means that while Tasmania will likely deliver on the prerequisite for hotter summers, due to the climate emergency, the accompanied drying out of the highlands could leave the pencil pines too stressed to seed. That is why the 2020 masting was so important. An ambitious plan involving teams of volunteers, visiting specialists from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, helicopters and arborists was formed in December and tree enthusiasts on Facebook were mobilised to monitor conifer flowering. Those plans were spiked when the pandemic was declared, and Wood got permission for the two-person operation focused just on the pencil pines. Pencil pines are particularly tricky for seed gatherers, because they grow in the wild as suckers. “Most of the stands of the trees that you see in Tasmania are all clonal,” Wood says. “They sucker from their roots and spread that way so large strands of trees generally have only a couple of individuals. You may see several hundred trees but there may be only a dozen or less individuals in that stand.” They walked 70km over the five days, gathering two handfuls of pine cones from each of the 46 stands visited to ensure the seeds collected were genetically diverse. At the end, the bank was 8,000 seeds richer. “Unfortunately we have missed all the other opportunities we had,” Wood says. “Hopefully when the next masting event takes place those stands will still be there and still be happy.”"

"June was hot. Really hot. That much we knew. What we didn’t know was just how hot it was – not just in parts of Europe, but around the world. New analysis by the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, shows that temperature records weren’t just broken for Europe – they were completely obliterated. The previous European record for June, set in 1999, was smashed to bits – not just by a fraction of a degree, but by a full 1.0℃. It was also the hottest June the world has ever recorded, with the entire globe experiencing the warmest-ever June by 0.1℃. As parts of Britain sweltered in a single day of heat over the weekend, France recorded its highest-ever temperature of 45.9℃. And even though the early part of June wasn’t as warm, the “Saharan bubble” that rose up and sat over south-western Europe led to parts of Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic recording average five-day temperatures that were up to 10℃ hotter than you’d expect at this time of the year. But spare a thought for people on the Indian subcontinent. Before the monsoon brought some relief – and then widespread flooding – parts of the northern Indian state of Rajasthan had to cope with weeks of temperatures above 45℃, with maximums above 50℃ in some places. Is this climate change? What we scientists can say with absolute confidence is that as the world heats up, potentially lethal heatwaves will become more common in many parts of the world, including Europe. That’s not to say we can’t study the effects of climate change on individual events. But we must be careful in how we interpret the findings of such studies. A rapid “attribution study” published on Tuesday has suggested that France’s heatwave at the end of June was made five times more likely as a result of climate change. Doing such a fast attribution study, in a timeframe during which the heat is still on for some parts of Europe, is commendable stuff. For many people, leaders and politicians included, memories of the stifling impacts are still fresh. But it’s important to highlight the many caveats and self-professed limitations that come with this type of study. The atmospheric and climate systems that create heatwaves are fiendishly complicated. Accounting for all the drivers of June’s heatwave will take time and an immense amount of data crunching by some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. They will have to consider all the various influences: the path of the jet stream, the temperature of the oceans, the movement of wind and formation of clouds. Crucially, they will have to do the calculations both with and without the impact of human-influenced climate change. So much for the science. As a scientist, this is what I’m expected to say. And yet, this weekend as I sat in my garden, listening to Glastonbury on the radio and watching my children trying to keep cool in the paddling pool, I was overcome for the first time with a feeling I could not shake off. Guilt, and fear. Guilt, that by being too scientific about these things, I don’t have enough passion and impetus to do everything I can about it. And fear for the future we are leaving for my children. For all our children. So what’s to be done? It’s clear that whatever we decide to do, the extreme weather we’ve seen in recent days is going to be a part of all our futures. In Europe, we will have to change how we behave to cope with heatwaves. We will have to change how we build our homes, schools and hospitals to protect the people who are most vulnerable. And we need to provide people everywhere with more accurate and earlier warnings of oncoming hazards of every type, to give people the best chance to prepare.

      Climate change: 'We've created a civilisation hell bent on destroying itself – I'm terrified', writes Earth scientist


 That’s just to cope with the climate change we’ve already created. If we don’t like the idea of even more widespread, more common and more severe heatwaves, within our own lifetimes and those of our children, we have to change our habits – and fast."
"**Covid-19 could be causing lung abnormalities still detectable more than three months after patients are infected, researchers suggest.**
A study of 10 patients at Oxford University used a novel scanning technique to identify damage not picked up by conventional scans.
It uses a gas called xenon during MRI scans to create images of lung damage.
Lung experts said a test that could spot long-term damage would make a huge difference to Covid patients.
The xenon technique sees patients inhale the gas during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
Prof Fergus Gleeson, who is leading the work, tried out his scanning technique on 10 patients aged between 19 and 69.
Eight of them had persistent shortness of breath and tiredness three months after being ill with coronavirus, even though none of them had been admitted to intensive care or required ventilation, and conventional scans had found no problems in their lungs.
The scans showed signs of lung damage - by highlighting areas where air is not flowing easily into the blood - in the eight who reported breathlessness.
The results have prompted Prof Gleeson to plan a trial of up to 100 people to see if the same is true of people who had not been admitted to hospital and had not suffered from such serious symptoms. He is planning to work with GPs to scan people who have tested positive for Covid-19 across a range of age groups.
The aim is to discover whether lung damage occurs and if so whether it is permanent, or resolves over time.
He said: ""I was expecting some form of lung damage, but not to the degree that we have seen.""
The risk of severe illness and death increases markedly for the over 60s. But if the trial discovers that the lung damage occurs across a wider age group and even in those not requiring admission to hospital ""it would move the goalposts,"" according to Prof Gleeson.
He believes the lung damage identified by the xenon scans may be one of the factors behind long Covid, where people feel unwell for several months after infection.
The scanning technique was developed by a research group at the University of Sheffield led by Prof James Wild who said it offered a ""unique"" way of showing lung damage caused by Covid-19 infection and its after-effects.
""In other fibrotic lung diseases we have shown the methods to be very sensitive to this impairment and we hope the work can help understand Covid-19 lung disease.""
Dr Shelley Hayles is a GP based in Oxford involved in helping set up the trial. She believes that up to 10% of those who have had Covid-19 might have some form of lung damage which is leading to prolonged symptoms.
""We're now at more than one and a quarter million who have been infected - and 10% of that is a lot of people,"" she said.
""When medical staff tell patients that they don't know what's wrong with them and they don't know how to sort the symptoms out, it's very stressful.
""With most patients, even if the news isn't great, they want the diagnosis.""
That is true of Tim Clayden, who spent his 60th birthday at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with Covid symptoms that were so severe he believed that he would die. Fortunately he recovered but remains weary to this day. Tim was frustrated not knowing why he wasn't recovering to full health.
He said that he was simultaneously concerned and relieved when he received one of Prof Gleeson's scans which showed that his lungs were damaged.
""It does help knowing that there is an issue with your lungs,"" he says.
""I now know what it is. I know the origin of it. What I don't know, because no one does, is whether it is permanent or if it will pass. But I'd rather know than not know.""
Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""This is an interesting investigation and it's important that post-Covid lung damage is looked into further and on a larger scale so we can better understand the longer term damage caused.
""If further investigation shows that lung damage occurs, it could enable the development of a test that can measure lung damage caused by Covid-19 which would make a huge difference to many people with 'long covid' respiratory issues and also allow specific treatments to be developed.""

There’s a wise old saying about “don’t bite the hand that feeds you.” But perhaps we need a new saying along the lines of “don’t subsidize the foot that kicks you.” Here’s a good example: American taxpayers finance the biggest share of the budget for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is an international bureaucracy based in Paris. The OECD is not as costly as the United Nations, but it still soaks up about $100 million of American tax dollars each year. And what do we get in exchange for all this money? Sadly, the answer is lots of bad policy. The bureaucrats (who, by the way, get tax‐​free salaries) just released their “Economic Survey of the United States, 2010″ and it contains a wide range of statist analysis and big‐​government recommendations.   
  
  
The Survey endorses Obama’s failed Keynesian spending bill and the Fed’s easy‐​money policy, stating, “The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus successfully turned the economy around.” If 9.6 percent unemployment and economic stagnation is the OECD’s idea of success, I’d hate to see what they consider a failure. Then again, the OECD is based in Paris, so even America’s anemic economy may seem vibrant from that perspective.   
  
  
The Survey also targets some very prominent tax loopholes, asserting that, “The mortgage interest deduction should be reduced or eliminated” and “the government should reduce further this [health care exclusion] tax expenditure.” If the entire tax code was being ripped up and replaced with a simple and fair flat tax, these would be good policies. Unfortunately (but predictably), the OECD supports these policies as a means of increasing the overall tax burden and giving politicians more money to spend.   
  
  
Speaking of tax increases, the OECD is in love with higher taxes. The Paris‐​based bureaucrats endorse Obama’s soak‐​the‐​rich tax agenda, including higher income tax rates, higher capital gains tax rates, more double taxation of dividends, and a reinstated death tax. Perhaps because they don’t pay tax and are clueless about how the real world operates, the bureaucrats state that “…the Administration’s fiscal plan is ambitious…and should therefore be implemented in full.”   
  
  
But even that’s not enough. The OECD then puts together a menu of additional taxes and even gives political advice on how to get away with foisting these harsh burdens on innocent American taxpayers. According to the Survey, “A variety of options is available to raise tax revenue, some of which are discussed below. Combined, they have the potential to raise considerably more revenue… The advantage of relying on a package of measures is that the increase in taxation faced by individual groups is more limited than otherwise, reducing incentives to mobilise to oppose the tax increase.”   
  
  
The biggest kick in the teeth, though, is the OECD’s support for a value‐​added tax. The bureaucrats wrote that, “Raising consumption taxes, notably by introducing a federal value‐​added tax (VAT), could therefore be another approach… A national VAT would be easier to enforce than other taxes, as each firm in the production chain pays only a fraction of the tax and must report the sales of other firms.”   
  
  
But just in case you think the OECD is myopically focused on tax increases, you’ll be happy to know it is a full‐​service generator of bad ideas. The Paris‐​based bureaucracy also is a rabid supporter of the global-warming/climate-change/whatever-they’re-calling-it-now agenda. There’s an entire chapter in the survey on the issue, but the key passages is, “The current Administration is endeavouring to establish a comprehensive climate‐​change policy, the main planks of which are pricing GHG emissions and supporting the development of innovative technologies to reduce GHG emissions. As discussed above and emphasized in the OECD (2009), this is the right approach… Congress should pass comprehensive climate‐​change legislation.”   
  
  
You won’t be surprised to learn that the OECD’s reflexive support for higher taxes appears even in this section. The bureaucrats urge that “such regulation should be complemented by increases in gasoline and other fossil‐​fuel taxes.”   
  
  
If you’re still not convinced the OECD is a giant waste of money for American taxpayers, I suggest you watch this video released by the Center for Freedom and Prosperity about two months ago. It’s a damning indictment of the OECD’s statist agenda (and this was before the bureaucrats released the horrid new “Economic Survey of the United States”).

"A few years ago, convincing meat-free “meat” was nothing more than a distant dream for most consumers. Meat substitutes in supermarkets lacked variety and quality. Plant-based burgers were few and far between in major fast food outlets – and meaty they were not. But realistic alternatives to environmentally damaging meat are now big business – and global fast food chains are finally starting to take notice. Burger King has announced that after a hugely successful trial, it will roll out its partnership with plant-based meat company Impossible Foods across the US. McDonalds recently introduced the similarly meaty Big Vegan TS in its outlets in Germany, one of its five largest international markets. Now finally able to produce meat-free imitations that are for many indistinguishable from their beefy counterparts, the rapidly growing industry appears set to make serious waves in the once impregnable bastions of cheap meat. In so doing, it could kickstart a rapid decline in meat’s contribution to the climate crisis – driven not just by a global minority of vegans and vegetarians, but by millions of meat-eaters too. Thanks to rising interest in food technology from Silicon Valley’s start-up scene, such indistinguishable vegan meat came on the menu a little over five years ago.
Helped by huge investments, sophisticated marketing, and a friendly regulatory environment, US companies leaped to the forefront of vegan meat innovation. Products such as the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger soon entered into many smaller US restaurants and fast food outlets, before Burger King made it widely available across the country. In contrast, for a long time, tighter food regulations in Europe stifled meatless meat innovation. Thanks to the European Union’s precautionary principle, companies face much more stringent checks to show that new ingredients and foods aren’t harmful before they can go on sale. Quorn, a low-cost meat substitute that is now a household name, took almost ten years to be approved as a legitimate foodstuff, because its use of fungi was unprecedented. These tight regulations also stipulate that genetically modified ingredients have to be labelled, which may explain why the widely heralded Impossible Burger – which uses genetically modified yeast to produce the blood-like plant protein that tastes so much like beef – has not yet landed in European countries.

      What makes the Impossible Burger look and taste like real beef?


 Combined with differences in language, food culture and investment climate across European states, innovative start-ups looking to bring high-quality meat analogues took longer to thrive in Europe. But while the US may have had a head-start in high-quality vegan meat innovation, it may surprise you to know that plant-based alternatives are much more popular in parts of Europe. While some European states such as France, Portugal and Switzerland are yet to warm to fake meat, the average Briton (750g) or Swede (725g) consumed nearly twice as many meat alternatives in 2018 as in the US (350g), where vegan meats are have typically been more realistic and thus higher-priced than in much of Europe.  With the market growing at times by orders of magnitude as traditional meat-eaters switched on to plant-based products, it was only a matter of time before major European companies started cottoning on to the potential of high-quality meat imitations. In 2017, McDonald’s was quick to roll out a vegan burger, the McVegan, at its restaurants in Finland and Sweden. But it was not designed to closely resemble meat, and was marketed primarily at vegans. In the UK, where more than half of British people have either already reduced or are considering reducing their meat consumption, Greggs decided to blaze the trail. Having only last year considered vegan sausage rolls “too difficult” a proposition, they are now returning record profits thanks to an offering so popular that the bakery has struggled to keep up with demand. In traditionally meaty Germany, meat alternatives were practically non-existent ten years ago. But Germans now aren’t far off the USA in fake meat consumption, thanks in part to prominent processed meat brands entering the market. It’s no coincidence that McDonald’s in Germany has since decided to partner with Nestlé, a new major player in the meatless meat game, to offer a vegan burger there. If news of out-of-reach vegan burgers is giving you food envy, there is no need to worry. Different cultures, tastes, prices and administrative hurdles mean that developments will not happen everywhere at the same time. But in the next couple of years, expect to see a lot more plant-based meat coming to fast food chains near you. Realistic chicken imitations have thus far proved difficult to master, but KFC plans to trial a vegan version of its chicken fillet burger from June 17. Meanwhile Burger King is already exploring how best to bring its vegan burger to Europe. And, given the whopping 30% increase in sales brought by the Impossible Whopper, McDonald’s and Nestlé are already considering expanding their partnership beyond Germany. Crucially, these fast-food vegan meats are not just aimed at vegans and vegetarians, but meat-lovers too, who still make up the vast majority of the country populations across the world. The Impossible Whopper, for example, is marketed not as a planet-saving treat, but a healthier way to enjoy the same meaty taste their customers are used to. Some vegans baulk at the idea of replicating the taste of animal flesh – but the bigger picture is that such products will play a major role in realising projections that the majority of “meat” will not come from dead animals by 2040.  Taste and health still far outweigh concern for the environment and animal welfare as factors that determine whether people are willing to purchase plant-based meat. By tapping into these, vegan meat can massively reduce the hefty emissions burden and animal suffering caused by animal agriculture. Bring on the vegan meat revolution, I say."

Americans take religious liberty for granted. Unfortunately, this most fundamental freedom of conscience and action is not protected in many other countries around the world. 



State repression is the most obvious assault on religious faith. Today Christians face the death penalty in Afghanistan and Pakistan in prosecutions for converting from Islam and allegedly blaspheming Mohammed, respectively.



But the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom warns that “a second and equally egregious threat to religious freedom” is the failure “to punish religiously motivated violence perpetrated by private actors.” In this case public officials become accomplices to often brutal private violations of religious liberty.



The U.S. government’s ability to promote any kind of human rights in other nations is obviously limited. Nevertheless, religious liberty is the proverbial canary in the mine. If a state won’t respect this most basic freedom of conscience, it isn’t likely to respect people’s lives and dignity in any context. 



Unfortunately, there is more than enough bad news to fill the USCIRF’s latest annual report. The Commission focused on 28 countries. Worst were conditions in the 13 “countries of particular concern.” This rogue’s gallery is made up of Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.



 **Burma:** In this poor Southeast Asian nation, explains the panel, “Religious freedom violations affect every religious group.” Christians and other religious minorities have suffered the worst. House churches were essentially outlawed last year, following a prohibition of meetings in unregistered venues the previous year. 



Moreover, notes the USCIRF, “In ethnic minority areas, where low‐​intensity conflict has been waged for decades, the Burmese military forcibly promotes Buddhism and seeks to control the growth of Protestantism by intimidating and harassing adherents.” The junta’s periodic brutal campaigns have “destroyed religious venues, actively promoted conversion to Buddhism, confiscated land, and mandated forced labor. The Chin, Naga, Kachin, Shan, Karen, and Karenni peoples, each with sizable Christian populations, have been the primary targets of these abuses.”



Moreover, the regime routinely interferes with Buddhism, the country’s dominant faith. After large‐​scale protests in 2007, “the regime also began systematically to repress Burmese Buddhists, closing monasteries, arresting and defrocking monks, and curtailing their public religious activities.” Many of those arrested and detained “have reported torture, forced defrocking, hard labor, and other deprivations.”



 **China:** Although Beijing has been attempting to calm international fears about its rise, China’s leaders have been exhibiting their fear of religion. Reports the Commission: “The Chinese government strictly controls all religious practice and represses religious activity outside state‐​approved organizations. Some Chinese citizens can assemble to worship and conduct charitable projects within government‐​approved parameters. Unregistered religious groups, or those deemed by the government to threaten national security or social harmony, face severe violations, including fines, confiscation of property, imprisonment, and the destruction of religious sites. Religious freedom conditions for Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims are the worst they have been in the past ten years.”



Even members of officially‐​sanctioned churches “are not safe from harassment, detentions, and arrest due to the arbitrary nature of Chinese law an policy regarding religion,” notes the USCIRF. Unofficial groups are at far greater risk. “Though the total number of arrest and imprisonments declined in the past year, government efforts to suppress the growth and activities of ‘house church’ Protestants continue to be systematic and intense.” Perhaps most virulent has been the sustained campaign against the Falun Gong. 



**Eritrea:** This North African nation has been turned into a totalitarian hellhole by home grown revolutionaries, who suppress all freedoms indiscriminately. The regime recognizes but four religious groupings, and even their adherents are not safe.



According to the Commission: “Systematic, ongoing and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Eritrea. These violations include: arbitrary arrests and detentions without charge of members of unregistered religious groups; torture or other ill‐​treatment of religious prisoners, sometimes resulting in death; a prolonged ban on public religious activities by all unrecognized religious groups; closure by the authorities of the places of worship of these groups; inordinate delays on registration applications from religious groups; and the disruption of private religious gatherings and social events of members of unregistered groups.”



 **Iran:** Explains the USCIRF: “The government of Iran continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused.” Under political pressure, the regime “has increasingly manipulated the reach of its religious laws to silence, and in some cases put to death, Shi’a Muslims simply for exercising their internationally protected rights to freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief.”



Nevertheless, most vulnerable to repression are religious minorities: Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Sunni Muslims, and especially Baha’is. The latter are viewed as heretics and treated accordingly.



 **Iraq:** The Commission details how Christians and other religious minorities suffered after the U.S. invasion: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Iraq. Members of the country’s smallest religious minorities still suffer from targeted violence, threats, and intimidation, against which they receive insufficient government protection.” These smaller communities “also experience a pattern of official discrimination, marginalization, and neglect,” while religious violence continues between Sunnis and Shiites.



Most striking is the veritable destruction of Iraq’s Christian community, which predates the arrival of Islam. The original population of 1.4 million is down to about 500,000. The USCIRF quotes “Christian leaders warning that the result of this flight may be ‘the end of Christianity in Iraq.’ ”



 **Nigeria:** An estimated 12,000 have died in sectarian violence over the last decade. Reports the USCIRF, “The government of Nigeria continues to respond inadequately and ineffectively to recurrent communal and sectarian violence.” The tragic result has been more violence: “Years of inaction by Nigeria’s federal, state and local governments as created a climate of impunity, resulting in thousands of deaths.”



Although Christians and Muslims share responsibility, violence has been concentrated in the Muslim‐​majority states to the north, where Sharia law has been widely imposed. The legislation is supposed to be applicable only to Muslims, but “some states in recent years have instituted or tolerated discriminatory practices based on religious precepts,” including bans on public religious activities, notes the USCIRF.



 **North Korea:** This probably is the most repressive state on earth. Observes the Commission: “The government controls most aspects of daily life, including religious activity, which is allowed only in government‐​operated religious ‘federations’ or in a small number of government‐​approved ‘house churches.’ Other public and private religious activity is prohibited. Anyone discovered engaging in clandestine religious activity is subject to discrimination, arrest, arbitrary detention, disappearance, torture, and public execution.”



 **Pakistan:** The Commission paints a dark picture: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief continue in Pakistan. Religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws and blasphemy laws foster an atmosphere of intolerance. Sectarian and religiously‐​motivated violence is chronic, and the government has failed to protect members of religious minorities from such violence and to bring perpetrators to justice. Growing religious extremism threatens the freedoms of expression and religion or belief, as well as other human rights, for everyone in Pakistan, particularly women, members of religious minorities, and those in the majority Muslim community who hold views deemed un‐​Islamic by extremists.”



The blasphemy laws are routinely abused, resulting “in the lengthy detention of, and sometimes violence against,” religious minorities. Most frightening has been persistent sectarian violence.



 **Saudi Arabia:** This U.S. ally avidly promotes religious totalitarianism. The USCIRF points to “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom continue in Saudi Arabia.” Forget King Abdullah’s liberalizing pretensions: “the Saudi government persists in banning all forms of public religious expression other than that of the government’s own interpretation of one school of Sunni Islam and also interferes with private religious practice.” Despite official promises to tolerate expatriate workers worshipping in their homes, the government’s religious police regularly raid such gatherings and arrest non‐​Muslims. Lengthy imprisonment and torture await those arrested for religious offenses.



 **Sudan:** With the end of Sudan’s civil war, the situation has improved in south Sudan, where Christians and animists predominate. But religious persecution remains distressingly common.



Reports the Commission: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief continue to occur in Sudan. Violations include: the efforts by the Arab Muslim‐​dominated government in Khartoum to impose Sharia on Muslims and non‐​Muslims alike; governmental promotion of Sudan’s identity as being Arab and Muslims, thus effectively relegating non‐​Aras and non‐​Muslims to a secondary status in the society; the criminalization of conversion from Islam, a crime punishable by death, and the intense scrutiny, intimidation, and even torture of suspected converts by government security personnel; the denial of the rights of non‐​Muslims to public religious expression and persuasion, while allowing Muslims to proselytize; and the difficulty in obtaining permission to build churches, as compared to government funding of mosque construction.”



 **Turkmenistan:** Human rights have improved in recent years, but abuses remain rife. According to the USCIRF, the country’s religious law includes: “intrusive registration criteria; the requirement that the government be informed of all financial support received from abroad; a ban on worship in private homes and the public wearing of religious garb except by religious leaders; and severe and discriminatory restrictions on religious education.”



There is no recognition of conscientious objectors. The government interferes with internal church governance. Unregistered religious groups face systematic legal disabilities. Production of religious literature is banned. Worse, “in recent years, members of religious communities, including Muslims, Protestants, Jehovah’s Witnesses and a Hare Krishna, reportedly received prison terms or were sent into internal exile due to their religious convictions.”



 **Uzbekistan:** Reports the Commission: “The Uzbek government harshly penalizes individuals for independent religious activity, regardless of their religious affiliation. A restrictive religion law severely limits the rights of all religious communities and facilitates the Uzbek government’s control over them, particularly the majority Muslim community.”



Religions must register with the government: “Unregistered religious congregations may be subject to massive fines and police raids, as well as threats of physical violence, detentions, and arrest.” Yet the authorities routinely refuse to accept registrations from disfavored churches, including Baptists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentecostals, and others. The government also misuses laws against “extremism” to persecute the same groups, as well as Muslims. 



**Vietnam:** This communist state harshly restricts religious liberty. According to the USCIRF, the regime “continues to control government‐​approved religious communities, severely restrict independent religious practice, and repress individuals and groups viewed as challenging political authority.”



In fact, religious liberty is under sustained assault: “individuals continue to be imprisoned or detained for reasons related to their religious activity or religious freedom advocacy; police and government officials are not held fully accountable for abuses; independent religious activity remains illegal; legal protections for government‐​approved religious organizations are both vague and subject to arbitrary or discriminatory interpretations based on political factors; and new converts to some Protestant and Buddhist communities face discrimination and pressure to renounce their faith.” Moreover, the Commission charges that dozens of people remain in prison for their faith and religious rights advocates have been threatened and imprisoned.



The foregoing is a Dirty Baker’s Dozen of religious repression. But another dozen countries go on the “Watch List” — countries which engage in severe religious persecution, just not quite so bad.



Afghanistan is an American client state, but explains the USCIRF, “individuals lack protection to dissent from state‐​imposed orthodoxy.” Authoritarian Belarus has been compared to that of the Soviet Union. Cuba impedes and monitors religious organizations and harasses and arrests religious activists. In Egypt “Serious problems of discrimination, intolerance, and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavored Muslims, remain widespread.”



The response of India’s central government to widespread communal violence and provincial discrimination remains inadequate. The problem is similar in Indonesia, where “sectarian violence, terrorism, and religious freedom violations” go unchallenged by local and regional officials. In Laos, provincial officials “severely violate the freedom of religion or belief, including detentions, surveillance, harassment, threats of property loss, forced relocations, and forced renunciations of faith.” In Russia religious liberty is shrinking along with political and civil freedoms. 



Religious minorities have suffered badly in the ongoing sectarian strife in Somalia. Tajikistan restricts all religious life. Turkey sharply limits public expression of religious faith while Christians have suffered from deadly Muslim assaults. In Venezuela there has been an increase in “government rhetoric, and in some cases government actions, against the Jewish and Catholic communities and certain Protestant groups.”



Finally, the Commission is monitoring three other countries where persecution remains a problem. Religious minorities fare poorly in Bangladesh. Kazakhstan has been moving backwards on religious liberty issues. Communal violence is common in Sri Lanka, and legislation has been proposed to criminalize conversion.



Washington’s ability to promote religious liberty overseas always will be limited. Nevertheless, religious persecution must be part of Washington’s human rights dialogue with other nations. Moreover, Americans should support and pray for those who are denied the right to worship freely. The oppressed must not be forgotten.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning.**
Pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday \- and unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the rules - coming three weeks after the end of a 17-day firebreak lockdown - were a ""matter of deep regret"" but were needed to tackle a rise in cases, particularly among under-25s. Cinemas, bowling alleys and other indoor entertainment venues will also be shut. Read about the new restrictions here.
The government's Covid mass testing programme for England is to be expanded further, the health secretary has announced, suggesting it offers areas ""a faster way out of the toughest restrictions"". Speaking at a Downing Street briefing Matt Hancock cited the example of Liverpool, which will move down from tier three to tier two restrictions later this week. We take a closer look at so-called community testing and how it works.
Door-to-door carol singing should ""probably not"" take place in Scotland this Christmas, the country's national clinical director has suggested, amid concerns it could increase the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets. Prof Jason Leitch was speaking after new advice for England said singing would be allowed in groups of up to six people. Meanwhile, Downing Street has confirmed that Santa's grottos will be allowed in England in those venues that are permitted to be open. If you are thinking about Christmas Day itself but confused about who you can see, take a look at our guide to the rules.
Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the communities secretary has said. Rules restricting opening hours will be able to be temporarily waived by local authorities - with the aim of both allowing a safer shopping experience and boost a sector hit hard by the pandemic. The announcement was welcomed by the British Retail Consortium but another business lobby group, UK Hospitality, described it as ""arbitrary and unfair"". Meanwhile, it has been suggested that drinkers in tier two areas of England could order just a Scotch egg with their pint to keep in line with post-lockdown rules.
Rita Ora has apologised after breaking lockdown rules in England to celebrate her 30th birthday. In an Instagram post, the singer says she made a ""misguided"" and ""spur of the moment"" decision to attend a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday - reportedly attended by up to 30 people. Current lockdown regulations are in force until 00:01 GMT on Wednesday and mean you can only meet one other person outside.

 _a stock of usual tactics or methods straight from his opponent’s political playbook._



In this instance, Judith Collins is wise to avoid anything remotely connected to her opposition’s playbook, simply because their tactics don’t work for them and won’t help her either.



Collins, bless her heart, takes an intelligent and diligent approach to her work, unlike other politicians we could name but don’t need to because we know who they are. 



Instead, she took a leaf out of the political playbook written by the master politician of social media, the great and one and only Donald Trump the Tweeter.



Collins has been on Twitter for a while now, but lately, I have noticed more tweets than usual. 



This week she called out our part-time PM for unfairly berating Scott Morrison over climate change and then reprimanded Andrew Little for calling ACT and the National Party politicians fascists. “Not funny”, Judith said, quite rightly, particularly when the fascist label fits Andrew Little so much better, but of course Collins is far too kind to say so.



Deeply offensive and entirely untrue for the NZ Minister of Justice to liken to FASCISTS, the ACT Party & NZ National Party members who supported a ban on prisoners voting in 2010. All of this taking place in Parliament’s debating chamber. [#NZQT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NZQT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#disgusting](https://twitter.com/hashtag/disgusting?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)



Collins is indisputably increasing her public profile and getting her voice heard where it counts, which is outside the MSM. Still, the MSM give her a fair amount of coverage but Collins is right not to trust them. She knows however nice they are, they can turn on you like rabid wolves at the first smell of blood. She won’t have forgotten the time they sent her scuttling off to the backbenches. Retreat is not in Collin’s nature, but in those circumstances retreating and licking her wounds was the lesser of two evils. 



‘Crusher’ Collins is a strong woman and a fighter and the National Party know it. Wouldn’t you think they would be grateful for her strength and loyalty? Not so, instead of slobbering all over her in gratitude they simply use her to prop up their ailing party, keeping her at arm’s length and us in the dark about how far they will let this gifted woman rise.



Not far, it appears while Simon Bridges clings to leadership like a drowning sailor hangs onto the mast of a yacht in a storm. Although, it was a relief when his partner in the art of murky politics stepped away from the helm.



The National Party are dead in the water but oblivious to the fact. They think their history of success and the CoL’s appalling performance will rocket them back into power at the next election. They are wrong.



The Nats reek of dirty politics. At best they have been feeble in opposition, **ignoring the free speech debate,** throwing their support behind expensive and bogus climate change legislation, supporting the badly written gun reform law and in short allowing arguably the worst government to ever grace the beehive get away with ruining the economy. Judith Collins has been standout in calling the CoL to account on housing but the only other serious opposition the CoL faced came from David Seymour on free speech. 



It is slim pickings for conservative voters at the next election. Collins in the rank and file is not enough to persuade traditional national voters to support them again, but Collins in leadership is much more compelling. It’s a great pity she may be forced to go down with the ship, with Bridges still clinging to the mast.

"It is a challenging time to be 16 and, like his peers, Dara McAnulty must currently endure a form of house arrest that means no seeing friends, no GCSEs. Unlike other locked-down teens, McAnulty is also dealing with the harsh mischance of having his first book, Diary of a Young Naturalist, published during the coronavirus crisis. He was supposed to be touring festivals but every date is cancelled. “I feel like my being is suffering from a slow puncture,” McAnulty tweeted in March. “I honestly feel like my world is falling apart right now.” When we meet via a video call a month later, his mood has lifted. Lockdown is tough. His mum, Róisín – who McAnulty likes to have by his side, discreetly, during interviews – contracted coronavirus quite severely; meanwhile, he feels “trapped” and is “bouncing around the house like a ping pong ball”. Mercifully, over the road from their modern housing estate is a wood where he takes his daily exercise. “If I didn’t have it, I would be utterly insane,” he says. “The ground there is alive with peacock butterflies”, and that morning, he saw a red squirrel “so that makes the day”, he grins.  There is a genuine buzz around his debut, a combination of nature book and memoir, a warm portrait of a close-knit family and a coming-of-age story. Robert Macfarlane has hailed his “extraordinary voice and vision”; Chris Packham has become a friend; Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes, called him “inspiring”. The teenager’s environmental activism has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg. McAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham’s Fingers in the Sparkle Jar which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist’s Asperger’s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer’s day, he writes: “Dragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.” Or: “The valley sings, heaves and rests.” There are original, imaginative descriptions too – caterpillars move “like slow-motion accordions” and a goshawk chick looks “like an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter”. He lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bláthnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, Róisín, Lorcan and Bláthnaid are also autistic; only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as “as close as otters”. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and “pretty formidable, apparently”. McAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: Seamus Heaney. “You can reread his poems again and again”; there are “all these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there’s no centre to it. There’s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we’d be too stupid to understand that brain. That’s almost the same as Seamus Heaney’s poems because they have such complex connections.” He also enjoys reading Ursula K Le Guin, is currently “neck-deep” in his umpteenth rereading of The Lord of the Rings, and is fond of Agatha Christie for her focus on people’s hidden motives. “That’s been quite important to me because I try my best to learn about humans so I can make acceptable social interactions.” A teacher once told McAnulty he would never be able to string a paragraph together. He was miserable – “and miserable is an understatement” – at a succession of schools, including Oscar Wilde’s alma mater, Portora. The bullying (he didn’t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him. McAnulty learned that being in nature helped. “I can’t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there’s all of those different noises coming from different angles – my brain can’t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It’s not oppressive.” He wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. “One of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,” he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. “Four years ago I wouldn’t have been able to talk to you right now,” he says. “Twitter opened my world to like-minded people. You’ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It’s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.” As McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism – campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey – his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on Springwatch and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book. Diary of a Young Naturalist tells the story of McAnulty’s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called Big Dog. “When I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: ‘I don’t want change.’” The move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). “Removing” himself from Big Dog “was devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes” – the mountain range close to his new home – “and everything became fine again.” Was his recovery as simple as that? “No, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.” Writing was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. “All my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,” says McAnulty. But Róisín says she wouldn’t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. “Although it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.”  Rewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to “re-experience” memories both traumatic and joyful. “I uncovered things about myself along the way. It’s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.” After his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. “It has been the best school I’ve had,” he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but “I have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I’ve had the best luck in the world … I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.” McAnulty plans to take biology – his first love – alongside maths, chemistry and politics at A-level. He is currently writing a picture book for younger children and anticipates a career in conservation science. Activism takes up an increasing portion of his time. He runs a project to satellite-tag birds of prey, an eco group at school, and is prominent in his generation’s call for action over the climate and biodiversity crises. Although the British government last year became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050, these are still only words, he believes, and his generation is becoming impatient. “We see a problem and we need to fix it. So when [politicians] don’t fix it and seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier.”  In the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when “the night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can’t really see the sun’s light but you know it’s just underneath the horizon,” he says. “At that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That’s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.” • Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP £16). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

"**Wales is potentially facing levels of unemployment not seen since the recession of the early 1990s, according to new modelling.**
Research commissioned by the BBC suggests the number of long-term jobless could rise to about 44,000 people.
That would be a four-fold increase on the current number.
The Welsh Government said investment was needed to soften the blow, but tough times lie ahead.
While the rate of unemployment is broadly similar in Wales and England, unemployment in Wales has risen at double the rate across the border since the beginning of 2020.
There has been a 41% increase in Wales compared to just 18% in England - meaning an estimated additional 20,000 people are looking for work in Wales.
And despite recent good news about vaccines and a possible end to lockdowns in the New Year, experts say there could be worse to come.
David Hagendyk, director of the Learning and Work Institute in Wales, has been modelling how the country's unemployment figures could look.
For the long-term unemployed, the picture is bleak. Currently, there are 11,000 people in that category in Wales, but Mr Hagendyk said that figure could rise steeply.
""Our modelling shows that could go up and be between 29,000 or 67,000 people being long-term unemployed.
""That gives us a mid-range of about 44,000.
""It blows out of the water the 2008 financial crisis in terms of long-term unemployment numbers.
""It takes us back to the early 1990s and the kind of recession we had then.""
Mr Hagendyk said that, while the numbers were eye-catching, it was important to remember the human stories behind them.
""These are real people with real jobs, real families and we know there is a long-term scarring impact.
""It's absolutely critical that the government acts quickly in order to stop this kind of modelling potential that we might see.""
James Aubrey said he wanted to be a pilot for as long as he could remember, tailoring his exams and work experience to that goal.
He had to fund a two-year training course - borrowing Â£100,000 which he has to pay back over the next decade.
That shouldn't have been a problem for the 22-year-old from Cardiff, but the aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic.
""The starting salaries most airlines were offering was about Â£40,000 which meant there was enough to pay off the loan and be able to live as well,"" said James.
But pilots are being laid off rather than being recruited, so James has decided to look for a job in retail - where he worked before his training - to ensure he has an income in the short-term.
""The loan is bonded to my parents' house,"" he said.
""So it means there's an added extra bit of pressure on top just to meet those repayments, just to make sure it doesn't affect my family as well as me.""
Though still determined to work as a pilot, James is concerned it could take him far longer than planned to get back into aviation.
The Welsh Government said it had allocated more than Â£1bn to support businesses and protect jobs during the pandemic.
Despite this, unemployment is rising faster in Wales than in England.
Mr Hagendyk said the underlying reasons for that lie in the way some sectors employ more people in Wales.
""Our research has shown that about one in five workers here in Wales are working in shutdown sectors - the parts of the economy that have been most affected by the first lockdown,"" he said.
""These are companies in hospitality and tourism, aviation and high street retail - that's about a quarter of a million workers here in Wales.""
Because so many people work in these vulnerable sectors, it does not bode well for the future, said Mr Hagendyk.
""They're more likely to be letting people go, making redundancies,"" he said.
""They're also most likely not to be hiring new people.""
Across Wales the hospitality sector has been amongst the hardest hit - takings have plummeted for hotels, pubs and restaurants.
On the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd, the Bryncynan pub began the year by spending Â£1m on a refit.
The pub's manager Heidi Bakewell was forecast to take a similar amount in revenue over the year but in reality the pub has taken about a quarter.
Heidi had also taken on and trained new staff, with some facing losing their jobs because restrictions and lockdowns meant the pub couldn't trade normally.
""I haven't slept the last couple of nights just through thinking, what are we going to do?
""Do we share the hours out, so they all get a few hours? It doesn't really work then because it's not enough for them to live on.
""We've still got three chefs. I think we've got 11 out-front staff still.
""Those numbers will probably go, I would say, to two chefs at the very most and we'll probably cut our front staff, maybe down to five.""
When Pontypridd fashion boutique Kookoo Madame reopened in September, people queued down the street for the few jobs on offer.
Among the hopefuls hoping to land a shop floor job were senior managers, people with degrees and those who were qualified but couldn't get into their chosen industries.
For owners Emma and Rez Jamal, 2020 has thrown up many obstacles.
First they were flooded out by Storm Dennis, and as they recovered from that, the first lockdown came.
To save their business, they moved to a new premises and had to choose between paying for the move or topping up staff wages when furlough ended.
""We had to make some redundancies, which was a really tough decision to make,"" said Emma.
""They were our staff who'd been with us for quite some time.
""It was awful, absolutely awful. I wouldn't want to go through it again.""
Although they were able to open in September, the firebreak meant they had to shut again.
""Everybody's scared, everybody's worried, nobody knows what's round the corner,"" said Emma.
Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said the way to combat the testing times to come was to invest in ""jobs, jobs and more jobs"".
He said: ""We've a proven track record in investing in people and supporting people through the most difficult economic times.
""We are confident that we have got plans, policies and schemes in place to prevent the devastating long-term scars that mass, long-term unemployment can inflict on our country.""
But Mr Skates admitted none of the forecasts he had seen had been ""rosy"".
""There is no forecast that suggests we will come out of this incredibly rapidly and are going to instantly bounce back,"" he said.
Many people across Wales face the prospect of having to learn a new profession as jobs dwindle.
Mr Hagendyk said to train even half the number of people who could end up long-term unemployed would be hugely expensive, possibly costing as much as Â£218m.
""This is investment above and beyond what we have already seen going into schools and colleges, so this is new money,"" he said.
""We have seen the Welsh Government expand training college places and apprenticeships to try to offset some of this challenge.
""But I think at the moment the scale of the response is not sufficient to meet the scale of the challenge.""
The Welsh Government said it would need additional funding from Westminster to help with retraining.
Additional funding to support skills has been announced by the UK government for England, and Wales will receive a consequential through the Barnett formula. However, there are fears that this funding alone will fall far short of what might be needed."
"The government faces a legal challenge over a set of “outdated” energy policies which are being used to approve fossil fuel projects even after it vowed to end Britain’s contribution to the climate crisis. Climate campaigners issued proceedings for a judicial review of the energy planning policies on Monday after officials refused to overhaul the rules, which could be used to support major fossil fuel power plants, open cast mines or fracking.  The campaigners claim that the policies undermine the government’s promises to tackle carbon emissions, including in the Paris agreement and in its own net zero legislation which became law last year. The energy planning policies were put in place by government officials almost a decade ago to help avert the risk of blackouts, but are still being used to justify fossil fuel projects, including the controversial plans for a new gas plant at the Drax site in north Yorkshire. Drax won permission to convert two of its coal-fired power units to burn gas, despite a clear warning from the planning inspectorate that a new gas plant would undermine the UK’s climate goals. Jolyon Maugham, a director at the Good Law Project, said: “We are teetering on the brink of a climate catastrophe. Yet the government is refusing to even commit to a review of an outdated energy policy that permits fossil fuel projects to be forced through. Our legal challenge seeks to change that.” The non-profit legal group is working alongside climate campaigners Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, and George Monbiot, a Guardian columnist, to call for the planning rules to be brought in line with the government’s own climate goals. “The government’s outdated energy policy means approval to frack in Lancashire or permission for a new open cast coal mine can be forced through, despite our national and international commitments to tackle the climate emergency,” Maugham said. The National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS) was set by officials in 2011, and called for planning decision makers to find in favour of “urgent” fossil fuel projects to avoid an energy supply crunch which was forecast to raise the risk of blackouts in the middle of the decade. The policy statement is still being used to approve fossil fuel projects, despite a boom in renewable energy which has bolstered the UK’s supplies in recent years. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was a matter for the courts. • This article was amended on 19 May 2020 to add a response from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy."
"The late 1980s marked a key moment for environmental science, matching triumph with looming disaster. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been observed since the late 1950s, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world’s leaders. At the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the Montreal protocol, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet’s protective atmospheric layer.  When scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO2 emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), a body of the world’s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies. Unfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton. Houghton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role. Chief executive (formerly director general) of the Met Office since 1983, he won numerous prizes and accolades, including the Chree medal and prize in 1979 and election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1976 to 1978. While the IPCC’s warnings did not result in the swift remedial action that some hoped for, the body continued to refine and expand its knowledge, producing regular comprehensive assessments and forecasts of the climate crisis. In 2007, the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with the former US vice-president Al Gore, with Houghton among those accepting the award in Oslo on behalf of the hundreds of scientists involved. Houghton remained as co-chair of the IPCC’s scientific assessment working group until 2002, and in that time also fostered a world-leading research effort at the Met Office and its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. The UK still occupies a place at the top table of global climate science today, with the Hadley Centre operating as one of the world’s top climate research hubs. On 1 May, the IPCC announced it would dedicate a key part of its forthcoming report next year to Houghton’s memory. Knighted in 1991, Houghton went on from the Met Office to chair, from 1992 to 1998, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, another landmark institution that had an influence on environmental science and policy before it was closed down in 2011 under the government’s austerity cuts. Houghton discovered his interest in science at a young age, while studying at Rhyl grammar school in north Wales. He was born in Dyserth, Denbighshire, to strongly evangelical Christian parents, Miriam (nee Yarwood) and Sidney Houghton, the second of three sons of whom the eldest, David, became a meteorologist and the youngest, Paul, a lecturer in engineering. The family moved to nearby Rhyl when John was two, and a statue of him was erected in the town in 2013. He went on to Jesus College in Oxford – sometimes known as the Welsh college for its strong links with Wales – and completed his BA in 1951 and DPhil in 1955. He soon became fascinated by Russia’s Sputnik missions, which he said “transformed” his thinking as they opened new vistas for atmospheric research through satellites. He developed these interests further as a professor of atmospheric physics at Oxford from 1972 to 1983 and deputy director of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory from 1981 to 1983. Throughout his scientific career, Houghton remained true to his devout evangelical Christian upbringing, and worked on combining the two as president of the John Ray Initiative, which aims to connect the environment, science and Christianity, and as a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion. He said of his Christian faith: “The most important choice I have made is to accept Jesus as my saviour and lord. I was brought up that way, but there was a point when I realised it was an important decision that I had to make.” As the UK takes on the presidency of the UN’s crunch climate conference this year, known as Cop26 and set to take place next spring in Glasgow, after being postponed owing to the coronavirus crisis, Britain’s climate science community will play a key role in providing world leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on rescuing the planet from climate breakdown – an effort that owes a lot to the work Houghton began more than three decades ago at the IPCC and Met Office. In 1962 Houghton married Margaret Broughton, and they had two children. After her death he set up the Margaret Houghton memorial fund, a research unit on medical nursing. In 1988 he married Sheila Thompson. Houghton published his autobiography, In the Eye of the Storm, in 2013, and retired to Aberdovey in west Wales, where his final years were clouded by dementia.  He is survived by Sheila, his children, Janet and Peter, his grandchildren, Daniel, Hannah, Esther, Jonathan, Jemima, Sam and Max, and his brother Paul. • John Theodore Houghton, atmospheric physicist, born 30 December 1931; died 15 April 2020"

NOTE: An update has been added below, using the press release that came out today after the news stories yesterday.
While ironic that something designed to reduce CO2 emissions (and presumably warming)is actually producing warming around it, this isn’t really any big surprise. Orchardists and vineyard operators in California have been using motor driven wind turbines to elevate local temperatures to save crops from frost for over half a century. What is different here is the scale of nighttime warming, large enough to be visible on MODIS satellite imagery thanks to large scale wind farms.
Large scale wind turbine farm in the Oklahoma panhandle. I had just visited a USHCN climate monitoring station about 2 miles downwind when I took this photo in December of 2008.
Dr. Roger Pielke Sr. and associates have been doing research along these lines for quite some time, and has this summary on some recent research.
From Louise Gray in the Telegraph:
Wind farms can cause climate change, according to new research, that shows for the first time the new technology is already pushing up temperatures.

Usually at night the air closer to the ground becomes colder when the sun goes down and the earth cools. But on huge wind farms the motion of the turbines mixes the air higher in the atmosphere that is warmer, pushing up the overall temperature.
Satellite data over a large area in Texas, that is now covered by four of the world’s largest wind farms, found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built. This could have long term effects on wildlife living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms. It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds.
Full story here:

Here’s the paper:
Zhou, Liming, Yuhong Tian, Somnath Baidya Roy, Chris Thorncroft, Lance F. Bosart and Yuanlong Hu 2012: Impacts of wind farms on land surface temperature. Nature Climate Chnage. doi:10.1038/nclimate1505
And the abstract (bold mine):
The wind industry in the United States has experienced a remarkably rapid expansion of capacity in recent years and this fast growth is expected to continue in the future. While converting wind’s kinetic energy into electricity, wind turbines modify surface–atmosphere exchanges and the transfer of energy, momentum, mass and moisture within the atmosphere. These changes, if spatially large enough, may have noticeable impacts on local to regional weather and climate.
Here we present observational evidence for such impacts based on analyses of satellite data for the period of 2003–2011 over a region in west-central Texas, where four of the world’s largest wind farms are located. Our results show a significant warming trend of up to 0.72 °C per decade, particularly at night-time, over wind farms relative to nearby non-wind-farm regions. We attribute this warming primarily to wind farms as its spatial pattern and magnitude couples very well with the geographic distribution of wind turbines.

Scientists find night-warming effect over large wind farms in Texas
Wind turbines interact with atmospheric boundary layer near the surface

Large wind farms in certain areas in the United States appear to affect local land surface temperatures, according to a paper published today in the journal Nature Climate Change.
The study, led by Liming Zhou, an atmospheric scientist at the State University of New York- (SUNY) Albany, provides insights about the possible effects of wind farms.
The results could be important for developing efficient adaptation and management strategies to ensure long-term sustainability of wind power.
“This study indicates that land surface temperatures have warmed in the vicinity of large wind farms in west-central Texas, especially at night,” says Anjuli Bamzai, program director in the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, which funded the research.
“The observations and analyses are for a relatively short period, but raise important issues that deserve attention as we move toward an era of rapid growth in wind farms in our quest for alternate energy sources.”

Considerable research has linked the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels with rising global temperatures.
Consequently, many nations are moving toward cleaner sources of renewable energy such as wind turbines. Generating wind power creates no emissions, uses no water and is likely “green.”
“We need to better understand the system with observations, and better describe and model the complex processes involved, to predict how wind farms may affect future weather and climate,” said Zhou.
There have been a growing number of studies of wind farm effects on weather and climate, primarily using numerical models due to the lack of observations over wind farms.
As numerical models are computationally intensive and have uncertainties in simulating regional and local weather and climate, said Zhou, remote sensing is likely the most efficient and effective way to study wind farm effects over larger spatial and longer temporal scales.
To understand the potential impact of wind farms on local weather and climate, Zhou’s team analyzed satellite-derived land surface temperatures from regions around large wind farms in Texas for the period 2003-2011.
The researchers found a night-time warming effect over wind farms of up to 0.72 degrees Celsius per decade over the nine-year-period in which data were collected.
Because the spatial pattern of warming mirrors the geographic distribution of wind turbines, the scientists attribute the warming primarily to wind farms.
The year-to-year land surface temperature over wind farms shows a persistent upward trend from 2003 to 2011, consistent with the increasing number of operational wind turbines with time.

“This warming effect is most likely caused by the turbulence in turbine wakes acting like fans to pull down warmer near-surface air from higher altitudes at night,” said Somnath Baidya Roy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a co-author of the paper.
While the warming effect reported is local and small compared to the strong background year-to-year land surface temperature variation, the authors believe that this work draws attention to an important scientific issue that requires further investigation.
“The estimated warming trends only apply to the study region and to the study period, and thus should not be interpolated into other regions, globally or over longer periods,” Zhou said. “For a given wind farm, once there are no new wind turbines added, the warming effect may reach a stable level.”
The study represents a first step in exploring the potential of using satellite data to quantify the possible effects of the development of big wind farms on weather and climate, said Chris Thorncroft of SUNY-Albany, a co-author of the paper.
“We’re expanding this approach to other wind farms,” said Thorncroft, “and building models to understand the physical processes and mechanisms driving the interactions of wind turbines and the atmosphere boundary layer near the surface.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe EU is now in the process of taking away larger size electric appliances from consumers, saying they consume too much energy. Small appliances are enough for the citizens and they’ll just have to learn to like them.
EU banning “energy-hungry” vacuum cleaners
Incandescent light bulbs have already been removed from the shelves. Next being removed are larger size vacuum cleaners. Germany’s online flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reports: “Beginning September 2014 in the EU only vacuum cleaners that consume less than 1600 watts may be sold. From 2017 only a maximum of 900 watts will be allowed.”
Hat-tip: DirkH
The FAZ writes that the ban was very quietly passed by Brussels some weeks ago, going unnoticed by the public.
Vacuum cleaners will also carry a sticker informing the consumer of the appliance’s energy efficiency rating. The EU thinks it can save energy by forcing consumers to buy only small appliances.
Whether the intrusion by the state will have an effect on overall electricity consumption remains a question. Smaller vacuum cleaners will only mean that housewives (and many husbands, of course) will have to spend twice as long vacuuming to get the house clean, and so may end up using even more electricity. This is the latest Brussels eco-justified intrusion into the free market and our private lives.

To be fair, the FAZ does write that the manufacturers of vacuum cleaners have pretty much accepted the law without protest, as most cleaners are already below the 1600-watt limit. However, a couple of high-end vacuum cleaner manufacturers, such as Vorwerk, are resisting.
What’s next?
The FAZ writes that not only light bulbs and vacuum cleaners are targeted for higher efficiency, but also an entire range of appliances. This is all in the wake of the European Ecodesign Directive, which will go into effect on November 1st for clothes dryers. “For condensation tumbler dryers, the weighted condensation efficiency must not be less than 60 percent.”
This latest additional government encroachment into private lives is necessary, European bureaucrats believe. Citizens have to stop being wasteful and it’s past time to rescue the planet from dangerous climate change, so claim the nannies in Brussels and other European capitals. It’s all for our own good.
How could people have come to accept being treated like irresponsible children who need to be nannied 24 hours a day? Surely if a poll were taken in Europe, a majority of citizens indeed would agree that they really are too stupid to make their own personal decisions and so it’s best that the state decides simple things for them, like the purchase of an appliance.
A large part of the European citizens have been brainwashed into believing this.
Recently the EU attempted to force consumers to have only the option of buying cars that emit low levels of CO2. But Angela Merkel resisted the move, claiming that Germany’s powerful automotive industry needs more time to make its cars more efficient.

Like too many other long‐​reigning fixtures on Capitol Hill, Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) doesn’t appreciate the magnitude of the challenge to the authority he presumes to hold over America’s job and wealth creators. Or, maybe he does, and frustration over that fact explains why he besmirches companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard.



Levin presided over a Senate hearing last week devoted to examining the “loopholes and gimmicks” used by these multinational companies to avoid paying taxes — and to branding them dirty tax scofflaws. Well here’s a news flash for the senator: incentives matter.



The byzantine U.S. tax code, which Senator Levin — over his 33‐​year tenure in the U.S. Senate — no doubt had a hand or two in shaping, includes the highest corporate income tax rate among all of the world’s industrialized countries and the unusual requirement that profits earned abroad by U.S. multinationals are subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation. No other major economy does that. Who in their right minds would not expect those incentives to encourage moving production off shore and keeping profits there?



Minimizing exposure to taxes — like avoiding an oncoming truck — is a natural reaction to tax policy. Entire software and accounting industries exist to serve that specific objective. Unless they are illegal (and that is not what Levin asserts directly), the tax minimization programs employed at Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard are legitimate responses to the tax policies implemented and foreshadowed by this and previous congresses. If Levin is concerned about diminishing federal tax collections from corporations (which, of course, reduces his power), the solution is to change the incentives — to change the convoluted artifice of backroom politics that is our present tax code.



Combine the current tax incentive structure with stifling, redundant environmental, financial, and health and safety regulations, an out‐​of‐​control tort system that often starts with a presumption of corporate malfeasance, exploding health care costs, and costly worker’s compensation rules, and it becomes apparent why more and more businesses would consider moving operations abroad — permanently. Thanks to the progressive trends of globalization, liberalization, transportation, and communication, societies’ producers are no longer quite as captive to confiscatory or otherwise suffocating domestic policies. They have choices.



Of course many choose to stay, and for good reason. We are fortunate to have the institutions, the rule of law, deep and diversified capital markets, excellent research universities, a highly‐​skilled workforce, cultural diversity, and a society that not only tolerates but encourages dissent, and the world’s largest consumer market — still. Success is more likely to be achieved in an environment with those advantages. They are the ingredients of our ingenuity, our innovativeness, our willingness to take risks as entrepreneurs, and our economic success. This is why companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Hewlett‐​Packard are born in the United States.



But those advantages are eroding. While U.S. policymakers browbeat U.S. companies and threaten them with sanctions for “shipping jobs overseas” or “hiding profits abroad” or some other manifestation of what politicians like to call corporate greed, characterizing them as a scourge to be contained and controlled, other governments are hungry for the benefits those companies can provide their people. Some of those governments seem to recognize that the world’s wealth and jobs creators have choices about where they produce, sell, and conduct research and development. And some are acting to attract U.S. businesses with incentives that become less necessary every time a politician vents his spleen about evil corporations. Not only should our wealth creators be treated with greater respect from Washington, but we are kidding ourselves if we think our policies don’t need to keep up. As I wrote in a December 2009 Cato paper:



Governments are competing for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative friction.



This global competition in policy is a positive development. But U.S. policymakers cannot take for granted that traditional U.S. strengths will be enough. We have to compete and earn our share with good policies. The decisions made now with respect to policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.



Since another hearing devoted to thanking these companies for their contributions to the U.S. economy is unlikely, perhaps Senator Levin should at least consider the perils of chasing away these golden geese.

These days, the Trump administration’s attacks on trade liberalization, trade agreements, and the World Trade Organization are focused on issues such as trade deficits and allegations that the United States is being treated “unfairly.” But before Trump and his trade team hijacked the trade debate, there had been a critique from the left that trade was bad for the environment in various ways. One example was that trade agreements supposedly got in the way of domestic environmental regulation. There had been some trade disputes over domestic environmental regulations, some of which had included provisions that discriminated against foreign products in favor of domestic ones, and environmental groups were concerned about the impact of adverse rulings by WTO “panels” (i.e., quasi‐​judicial courts) on their ability to adopt such regulations.   
  
  
While that debate has been overshadowed recently, it came back yesterday after a WTO panel ruling on various U.S. state measures that discriminate against foreign products in the renewable energy sector. In reaction to this ruling, Todd Tucker of the Roosevelt Institute wrote the following:   




The World Trade Organization (WTO) is back in the news, with a Thursday ruling against seven U.S. states’ renewable energy policies. The WTO is already unpopular with right‐​wing nationalists like Donald Trump. By siding with India against the U.S., the WTO is likely to make left‐​leaning politicians and the burgeoning global environmental movement unhappy. 



**States Are Acting on Climate because the federal government won’t**



The WTO is acting against state level policies intended to improve the environment, stepping into the void left by the federal government. In 2009, the U.S. Senate refused to vote on what was at that time the most ambitious climate change legislation: the Waxman‐​Markey Act. Concluding that federal action might never be forthcoming, U.S. states (especially those than lean Democratic) began enacting climate policy of their own.   
  
  
The measures range from biodiesel incentives in Montana, through nudges for Michigan‐​made clean energy manufacturing, to other schemes in California, Delaware, Connecticut, Minnesota and Washington State. The common denominator of these policies is an attempt to soften the inevitable economic dislocations of moving away from the carbon economy. The Michigan policy was typical: electricity providers get a renewable credit when they generate one megawatt of green energy. However, they get another tenth of a credit when that energy uses Michigan‐​made equipment or Michigan laborers.   
  
  
…   




**The WTO sees “Buy Local” politics as protectionist**



When India complained about these green schemes, they did not have to show that Indian companies tried to qualify for any of them, or that they had been denied access, or that they lost any money to make a case at the WTO. Under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT), Michigan’s energy credit was invalid, because Indian solar panel exporters _in theory_ would have not qualified for that extra tenth of a renewable energy credit if they had tried to sell them in Michigan.



…   
  
  
**This is a Problem for the Green New Deal**   
  
  
The WTO decision collides with a groundswell of progressive interest in a Green New Deal — a plan that looks a lot like the state policies that the commercial body just ruled against. The Green New Deal resolution by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D‐​Mass.) outlines five goals, 14 projects and 15 requirements to help evaluate those projects. Instead of just going ahead with carbon taxes (which would likely be unpopular), it gives groups that might be expected to oppose a carbon tax — front line communities, manufacturing workers — a stake in the deal’s success. It uses Buy Local or Hire Local requirements to make its proposed climate solutions politically sellable and viable. These are the sorts of provisions that India and other countries can be expected to challenge if and when a Green New Deal ever gets through Congress.   
  
  
…



In reality, while there may be some actual trade and the environment conflicts that are hard to sort out, this is not one of them. The WTO ruling here is very narrow. It is not a general condemnation of subsidies for environmental causes. Rather, it simply says that governments cannot discriminate against foreign goods when adopting their environmental policies. That ruling is actually pro‐​environment. If governments are trying to promote the adoption of environmentally‐​friendly products, competition is helpful not harmful. Generally speaking, environmentalists should want more trade in these products, not less. As I jokingly put it on twitter, “The fundamental question: Do you want artisan, hand‐​crafted solar panels from the Eastern Shore of Maryland for a million dollars a pop, or do you want highly efficient solar panels made by a Chinese factory in Iceland that is powered by geothermal energy?” Shielding local producers from competition makes them stagnant and inefficient. That’s not the way to develop good renewable energy products. If the Green New Deal does that, it is not going to be very green.   
  
  
There is a group of people out there who still believe in old school industrial policy, advocating a wide range of government interventions in the economy (including protectionist measures like the ones at issue here), in order to build up domestic manufacturing. But the policies they are pushing cannot be categorized as pro‐​environment, and often these policies will be pretty bad for the environment. It’s a shame, because this is one area where supporters of trade liberalization should be able to work together with environmentalists by pushing for lower trade barriers on these products, as my old colleague Bill Watson and I wrote about here.

This email in December 2003 shows what appears to be the genesis of the idea of setting up the RealClimate.org website.
There a BBC (impartiality – ho ho) connection. Roger Harrabin at this meeting at Tyndall (why was he there in the first place?) of the BBC apparently “…wanted something more pro-active.” according to the email.
Bishop Hill writes:
#2974 is an email from Prof John Shepherd, a Tyndall advisory board member, to RealClimate’s Stefan Rahmstorf. Dated December 2003, it is a response to an email in which Rahmstorf has suggested setting up a website to counter sceptic arguments (perhaps the germ of the idea for RealClimate itself?). That’s not the point though. The point will be clear when you read Shepherd’s report of a meeting of Tyndall’s advisory board. 
Many thanks for your very helpful comments. Essentially I agree on all counts, and indeed the “sceptics ask, scientists answer” web-page that you have set up is exactly the sort of thing I had in mind as a possible minimal response that we (Tyndall et al, and even maybe the Royal Society if it wants to get involved) might undrertake. Wherever possible this could/should refer to other reputable sites (incl IPCC, Hadley Centre, the ones you mention, etc etc) rather than duplicating the material. I would envisage that such a site could be maintained by a consortium of the willing, in this case involving (say) Tyndall, Hadley & PIK. We could then asked the RS (et al) to mention it and link to it on some sort of “sound science” page on their own web-site(s) (Rachel, do you think that this might fly ?).
We had an interesting debate on this at the Tyndall Advisory Board last week, and the consensus was very much in line with your views, except for the journalist present (Roger Horobin), who wanted something more pro-active. I am more sympathetic to his view than most of you, I think, but the question is what more would be useful, effective, and not too burdensome ? So far I don’t think I have identified anything, but I do think that the sort of web-page mentioned above would be a start, and so I am copying this to Asher Minns, for him to consider and discuss with John & Mike at Tyndall Central.
The date of this email is Wed, 03 Dec 2003
Academia moves slowly in most things. They had to build consensus and then search for money to do it, perhaps money that couldn’t be from NASA or other publicly funded research due to the conflicts of interest that would have created with such an outreach. They found money in the form of Fenton Communications, now Environmental Media Services.

The Brexit Party’s Christopher Monckton talks to investigative journalist Gemma O’Doherty and discusses a new study by Ronan & Michael Connolly showing that the greenhouse gas effect **cannot cause global warming** which he says backed up his own findings: [https://www.researchgate.net/publicat…](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=0DKVVhmxTfZbb17vd4872x6BXzJ8MTU2NzU3OTM5MUAxNTY3NDkyOTkx&v=k6iOOuZCE_Y&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F282389821_Re-evaluating_the_role_of_solar_variability_on_Northern_Hemisphere_temperature_trends_since_the_19th_century&event=video_description) On being denied an audience with the the environment secretary in the the UK, Monckton remarked: “The environment secretary was **willing to hear the side of the story that he wanted to hear from an autistic schoolchild** who hadn’t the faintest idea what she is talking about but who has been relentlessly propagandised by communist teachers…but he was not willing to hear a former member of his own party who leads a team of eminent scientists who had done a serious load of work over the last four years [and] had come to conclusion that the whole thing is nonsense.” “And if you put this evidence in front of the so-called conservative party in Britain which is supposed to be a centre-right party (it’s supposed to fight this sort of totalitarian nonsense), what do they do? They go and listen to a sixteen year old school kid having taken out six weeks NOT to read a scientific paper or even a two page summary of it in plane English which says “look mate, there is not a climate problem and we have proven it”…so when you are dealing with intellectual bankruptcy of that order, that’s why I’m no longer a Conservative because these people are thick as two short planks and that’s doing a disservice to the short planks.”

James Delingpole has ruthlessly scourged Greta Thunberg in a cutting critique where he describes her as being “emblematic of the stupidity of our age.”



St Greta of Thunberg has made it into the cover of _GQ_ and is now on her way across the Atlantic in a $4 million yacht to lecture Americans about climate change.



[…] what is a 16-year old autistic school drop-out who has done nothing of note in her life other regurgitate climate propaganda doing on the cover of a men’s magazine?



Call me naive but I thought the point of men’s magazines was to write about stuff that _men_ might find interesting: dodging snipers’ bullets in war zones; free-diving with great white sharks; playing Scrabble with the Medellin cartel; […] strafing a remote baboon colony in a Mig-25 Foxbat; the quest for the world’s purest MDMA.



Sure, girls have a place in this universe: as decoration and objects of lust. But spooky Greta with her pigtails and thousand-yard stare of disapproval is not only far too young to qualify for that status but far too earnest and grim.



And boring. What kind of man would be remotely interested in buying a mag whose main feature entailed a finger-wagging lecture […] about how, like, totally endangered the planet is and how totally it’s all our fault and how we’ve got to abandon all the things we hold dear — meat; air travel; fast cars; designer threads — in order to stop all the baby polar bears melting?



A lecture, furthermore, from a child who hasn’t finished her schooling, whose frontal lobes haven’t formed, who has no sense of humour, whose every utterance is the second-hand opinion of alarmist grown-ups […]



No kind of man that I know of, that’s for sure. Unless you count tofu-eating, milquetoast, pantywaist, beta, snowflake, self-flagellating, Mom’s-basement-dwelling, environmental science graduates as men.



Don’t hold back James, tell them what you really think LOL.



[…] why are so many adults who really should know better by dint of their age and experience hurrying to prostrate themselves before this pigtailed school drop out as if she were the new Messiah?



It’s not merely weird. It’s a form of mass hysteria […]



To appreciate just how irrational it all is, consider, by way of a thought experiment, if a 16-year-old autistic kid with pigtails just as fetching as St Greta’s were to organise a global school walkout in protest at mass immigration; or the oppression of women in the Middle East; or the destruction of rainforest to grow palm oil to make biofuels; or the devastation caused by wind energy to birds and bats; or China’s abuse of Hong Kong.



 **How many politicians do you think would be giving that child an audience?** How many millionaire yacht owners would be offering her free trips across the Atlantic? How many newspapers and TV channels would be giving her coverage of any kind?



 **The answer is none.**



That’s because unlike the fake cause being championed by St Greta, those problems are serious and real and intractable and contentious and not easily soluble by sound bites and vacuous, virtue-signalling gestures.



They don’t suit the mainstream media’s feel-bad-in-order-to-feel-good fashionable handwringing narrative about the “climate emergency”.



[…] But such is St Greta’s protected status at the moment that if you criticise her or make jokes about her, as the Brexit-supporting millionaire Arron Banks did recently on Twitter, you get reported to authorities. It even becomes a bona fide news story. (Or the BBC thinks it does…)



[…] the wankerati have completely lost the plot over St Greta. And maybe if no one listened to them, it wouldn’t matter. But a lot of impressionable people take what these influencers say seriously. Which is a bit of a worry when you stop to think about what it is that St Greta of Thunberg actually represents.



[…] [Here](https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/07/climate-change-we-dont-have-time/) is one of her puppet masters — Ingmar Rentzhog, the Swedish “entrepreneur” behind the tech start-up which has been exploiting Greta’s fresh-faced innocence to push his green agenda.



[…] If this doesn’t terrify you, it should. Not only is the environmental movement getting more radical — see, for example, Thunberg’s friends at Extinction Rebellion — but it also seems to be picking up more public support, in Europe at least, if not the U.S.



Here, though, are a few things we know:



 **There is no evidence** — beyond repeatedly debunked and falsified computer models — to suggest that recent global warming is catastrophic, unprecedented or significantly man-made.



Even if we could decide what the world’s ideal temperature is, **there is no evidence that mankind has access to a knob that can control it** — nor one that wouldn’t end up doing more harm than good.



Not a cent of the $1.5 trillion (plus) per annum currently being spent funding the Climate Industrial Complex is having any measurable effect on combating climate change.



Regardless of what we do in the West, India and China are committed to increasing their carbon dioxide emissions rapidly in a way that will dwarf any puny decarbonisation measures adopted unilaterally by Western economies.[…]



Yet none of these serious objections to the kind of drastic climate action that St Greta of Thunberg’s controllers are advocating ever gets a look-in. Instead, when people like me try to raise them we are dismissed as **deniers in the pay of Big Oil** (I wish!) or we are accused of being heartless and vindictive for picking on a 16-year-old autistic kid.



Well I’m sorry, but “Let’s bomb Western Industrial Civilisation back to the Dark Ages because a 16-year-old climate activist with cute pigtails made the cover of _GQ_ and is now travelling across the Atlantic on an expensive sailing boat” is not an argument. Really it isn’t. And the gullible grown-ups who think otherwise should be ashamed of themselves.

I have been amazed at how bad Wellington traffic has become in the last 5 years or so. Just this week, there were 2 major traffic incidents that caused tailbacks for literally miles. This is happening far too often, and while something desperately needs to be done, the current council is simply not up to it. They are far more interested in rainbow crossings than in getting Wellington moving. By and large, their answer to the traffic congestion is to put in another cycle lane.



So it comes as no surprise to find that the council has caved into Julie Anne Genter’s demands to increase public transport as a way to reduce congestion. The ideology on these issues is strong, but none of it is helping Wellingtonians to get to work, or their kids to get to school.



If Genter really thinks that public transport is the only way forward, then she should say so. Instead, she has insisted on keeping her letter to the Minister of Transport a secret. We all know what that means. So, instead of being ‘open and transparent’, which is something that the Greens have always campaigned on, she is dying in a ditch to keep that letter secret. It really must be bad.



Matthew Hooton isn’t having a bar of it.



This is a story about the allocation of $6.4 billion of public money and a Green Party that wants to cover up why particular decisions were made. It underlines that the Official Information Act (OIA) is broken. 



Contradicting the Wellington City Council, the Greater Wellington Regional Council and the NZ Transport Agency that had worked together on the plan for some years, Twyford’s package delayed a new Mt Victoria tunnel until the 2030s.  
Instead, the money would be allocated in the 2020s to — you guessed it — a billion-dollar-plus tram from the railway station to the airport. The tram would be slower than the airport bus, which currently takes only 25 minutes to the CBD yet is underused. 



In 2016, council and mayoral candidates campaigned on ‘4 Lanes to the Planes’. Now, it seems, we could get there faster by pony and cart.



Inquiries by Opposition transport spokesperson Chris Bishop have revealed that the background to the changed spending priorities included a letter from the Associate Transport Minister, the Greens’ Julie Anne Genter, to her senior minister, Labour’s Twyford.



The letter was written on ministerial letterhead and signed by Genter as Associate Minister.



A billion-dollar airport tram in a hilly city with a population of just 220,000 and only another 300,000 in its wider region would be globally unusual. We should expect to see detailed consideration of arguments and counterarguments as the two ministers debate whether the tunnel or tram should have priority. 



It will never work. People will have to travel to the CBD to get to the tram… almost certainly by car. Then, where exactly do they park? It is madness.



**It has even been reported that Genter and another Green MP threatened to resign if the tunnel went ahead before the tram.**



Well, that would hardly have been a loss, would it? Go ahead and resign. Make my day.



Under the OIA, the public has a legal right to see this to-ing and fro-ing about why their taxes will be spent on one thing instead of another. The Genter letter seems to have been pivotal. 



The Act specifies that its purpose is to progressively increase the availability of official information to enable New Zealanders to more effectively participate in public affairs and promote the accountability of ministers and bureaucrats. 



After all, the whole thing is being funded by taxpayer’s money, so yes… the taxpayer does have a right to know why and how decisions were made.



Its principle of availability demands all information be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it. Information must be released as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no case later than 20 working days after a request is received, or reasons given why it should be kept secret. 



As the only reason seems to be to save Julie Ann Genter’s skin, I don’t believe that counts as an acceptable reason for failure to disclose.



An eternal rule of politics is that, when it comes to ethical questions such as complying with the OIA, each Government is worse than the one before.



They adopt all the dirty tricks of their predecessors and invent new ones of their own.



Ardern, though, promised to break this cycle. 



Her confidence and supply agreement with the Greens’ James Shaw promised to “strengthen New Zealand’s democracy by increasing public participation, openness, and transparency around official information”. 



So Genter is in breach of the confidence and supply agreement too? So where is James Shaw on this? Or Jacinda, for that matter?



Genter now demands to keep secret her letter about the $6.4b funding package on the grounds that it would not be in the public interest for anyone else to see it. 



It is most definitely in the interests of Wellingtonians to see it, particularly when the tunnels they so badly want and need seem to have disappeared into the never-never.



The Official Information Act is now a joke. In spite of promises of transparency, this is the least open government for decades.



An intervention by the courts seems required, but that would require someone with the means to commit a decade to litigation. 



In the meantime, Genter is a disgrace to her party and herself and should either release her letter in full or resign. 



  
Neither will happen. It will simply be brushed under the carpet, like sex scandals, employment matters, Czech kickboxers, and anything else that might make the government look bad… although the lack of transparency is making them look bad anyway.



It seems we just reel from scandal to scandal with this government, but the Greens really are the worst part of it. We should never have anyone who is driven entirely by ideology anywhere near transport. In the meantime, Wellingtonians are resigned to decades of traffic congestion and disruption. So, remember this, guys, in the local elections this year, and the general election next year. Neither the government or the council cares about you. They just play to the climate gods… whoever they are.

**Nativity plays** will have to be performed within existing school bubbles, with no mixing across groups. Audiences in tier one and tier two areas will be subject to restrictions as well - like social distancing.
Santa's **grottos** can open if they are in venues that are permitted according to the tier that region is in. But ""appropriate Covid-secure measures"" like social distancing have to be in place as well.
Some have already made arrangements for Father Christmas to speak to children via video-streaming sites, instead of face to face.
**Carol singing** \- and carol services - can take place, as long as those attending adhere to the advice on singing safely, which has been put together with the help of Public Health England. Its advice includes singing in well-ventilated areas and keeping distance from each other. Door-to-door carol singing is allowed too, but in groups of a maximum of six.
Special rules have to be in place because singing increases the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets and aerosols in the air.
The number of people at a carol event should be limited as well. Those performing professionally or as part of a supervised activity for under 18s are not limited in number, but should still follow the performing arts guidance - including things like wearing masks and managing capacity.
For any indoor events, joining in with singing will not be allowed this year. But people can sing if they are outside.
Bishop of London Sarah Mullally welcomed the news about outdoor singing, saying: ""Singing is a very special part of our worship, especially at Advent and Christmas, so I know that the announcement that we will be able to come together for public singing outdoors this Christmas will bring comfort and joy to many.
""Advent and Christmas this year will not be the same as previous years but having outdoor congregational singing and indoor carol services with choirs is a reasonable balance and recognises our duty to protect and care for each other.""
Christmas bubbles can be in place from 23 to 27 December, to allow up to three households to spend the festive period together.
People, in all tiers, can attend **places of worship** for services from 2 December, but the rules on who you attend with depends on which tier you live in, with no indoor mixing allowed outside of tier one. However, people in the same Christmas bubble can attend together.
Christmas **volunteering** \- which can be a key part of the season for many - is allowed, but it is recommended you do this from home. You can volunteer outside the home but follow social distance guidance and advice on helping safely.
The rules on **shopping** depend on whether the shop is indoors or an outdoor market - and on the tier you live in. This will not change for 23 to 27 December when bubbles are in place, and includes Boxing Day sales."

UPDATE49: 10:00 AM PST 11/30 While not email related, just as Climategate breaks David Suzuki commits an egregious propaganda error second only to the 10:10 video where kids are blown up for not going along with carbon reduction schemes at school.

UPDATE33: Gobsmacking! Rob Wilson proves McIntyre and McKittrick correct in an email to colleagues at CRU, showing that when random noise time series are fed into Mike Mann’s procedure, it makes “hockey sticks”. The confirmation that M&M is right never leaves the walls of CRU.

You may recall Landsea resigned from the IPCC over this. Pielke says: “The gatekeeping of the IPCC process is abundantly clear, and the shadowy suggestion that they can find out who the reviewers are from another colleague is a bit unsettling as well.” Trenberth looks particularly bad here.

I have published a searchable database of the emails at http://foia2011.org
All email addresses and phone numbers are automatically redacted. It’s extremely rudimentary right now, but I’ll be refining the functionality and improving the search capabilities and navigation over the course of the next week.
UPDATE 12: 9:30 PM PST We’ve known for some time that Al Gore made up a bunch of claims in his AIT movie that simply weren’t true. Now this revelation in the new email batch shows that in the case of Kilimanjaro’s disappearing snows, even Phil Jones and Dr. Lonnie Thompson don’t believe global warming is the cause, even though Thompson put out a press release nearly a year ago saying just that.

from: “Michael E. Mann”..
subject: Re: Something not to pass on
to: Phil Jones
Phil,
I would not respond to this. They will misrepresent and take out of context anything you give them. This is a set up. They will certainly publish this, and will ignore any evidence to the contrary that you provide. s They are going after Wei-Chyung because he’s U.S. and there is a higher threshold for establishing libel. Nonetheless, he should
consider filing a defamation lawsuit, perhaps you too.
I have been talking w/ folks in the states about finding an investigative journalist to investigate and expose McIntyre, and his thusfar unexplored connections with fossil fuel interests.Perhaps the same needs to be done w/ this Keenan guy.
I believe that the only way to stop these people is by exposing them and discrediting them….
UPDATE7: 1:20 PM PST Phil Jones and Tom Wigley calls another scientist (The former state climatologist of California) a “jerk” for publishing his UHI results.
UPDATE6: 12:08PM PST Here’s an email that collaborates a radio interview I did in Seattle with Thomas Peterson in summer 2007, yes these are 100% real emails, no doubt whatsoever now. More here: Climategate 2.0 – NCDC: “Mr. Watts gave a well reasoned position”
UPDATE 5: 11:00AM PST In a statement, UEA doesn’t deny these emails, but posts about the whitewash investigations of the past, like they matter now.
UPDATE4: 9:45 AM PST I’ve changed the headline from Climategate 2.0 to Climategate 2.0  emails – They’re real and they’re spectacular!  with a hat tip to Jerry Seinfeld. The relevance of that headline is particularly interesting in the context of where Dr. James Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has his office in NYC.
UPDATE3: 9:25 AM PST – Having read a number of emails, and seeing this quote from Mike Mann in the Guardian:
When asked if they were genuine, he said: “Well, they look like mine but I hardly see anything that appears damning at all, despite them having been taken out of context. I guess they had very little left to work with, having culled in the first round the emails that could most easily be taken out of context to try to make me look bad.”
I’m going to conclude they are the real deal. I’ve posted a BitTorrent link to the file below. One big difference between Climategate 1 and 2 is that in 1, it took days for the MSM to catch on, now they are on top of it.
UPDATE2: 8:45AM PST The Guardian has a story up by Leo Hickman, and this excerpt suggests they may be the real deal:
Norfolk police have said the new set of emails is “of interest” to their investigation to find the perpetrator of the initial email release who has not yet been identified.
The emails appear to be genuine, but this has yet to be confirmed by the University of East Anglia. One of the emailers, the climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, has confirmed that he believes they are his messages.
UPDATE1: 8:20 AM PST These emails have not been verified yet, and this story was posted by one of my moderating staff while I was asleep. Until such time they are verified, tread lightly because without knowing what is behind the rest of the zip file, for all we know it’s a bunch of recipes and collection of  lorem ipsum text files. I’m working to authenticate these now and will report when I know more – Anthony Watts

The winner for Earth Hour every year since 2003  - North Korea. Odds favor them to be the winner again this year.
Every year at Christmas, many newspapers reprint “Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus“, this excellent essay by Ross McKittrick should be repeated on every blog on every observance of Earth Hour. Copy, paste, and share it widely. A poll on what you plan to do to observe this event follows.
The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity. I cannot do that, instead I celebrate it and all that it has provided for humanity. – Ross McKitrick
Earth Hour: A Dissent
by Ross McKitrick


Ross McKitrick, Professor of Economics, University of Guelph, Canada. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Image via Wikipedia


In 2009 I was asked by a journalist for my thoughts on the importance of Earth Hour.
Here is my response.
I abhor Earth Hour. Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century. Every material social advance in the 20th century depended on the proliferation of inexpensive and reliable electricity.
Giving women the freedom to work outside the home depended on the availability of electrical appliances that free up time from domestic chores. Getting children out of menial labour and into schools depended on the same thing, as well as the ability to provide safe indoor lighting for reading.

Development and provision of modern health care without electricity is absolutely impossible. The expansion of our food supply, and the promotion of hygiene and nutrition, depended on being able to irrigate fields, cook and refrigerate foods, and have a steady indoor supply of hot water.
Many of the world’s poor suffer brutal environmental conditions in their own homes because of the necessity of cooking over indoor fires that burn twigs and dung. This causes local deforestation and the proliferation of smoke- and parasite-related lung diseases.
Anyone who wants to see local conditions improve in the third world should realize the importance of access to cheap electricity from fossil-fuel based power generating stations. After all, that’s how the west developed.
The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity. I cannot do that, instead I celebrate it and all that it has provided for humanity.
Earth Hour celebrates ignorance, poverty and backwardness. By repudiating the greatest engine of liberation it becomes an hour devoted to anti-humanism. It encourages the sanctimonious gesture of turning off trivial appliances for a trivial amount of time, in deference to some ill-defined abstraction called “the Earth,” all the while hypocritically retaining the real benefits of continuous, reliable electricity.
People who see virtue in doing without electricity should shut off their fridge, stove, microwave, computer, water heater, lights, TV and all other appliances for a month, not an hour. And pop down to the cardiac unit at the hospital and shut the power off there too.
I don’t want to go back to nature. Travel to a zone hit by earthquakes, floods and hurricanes to see what it’s like to go back to nature. For humans, living in “nature” meant a short life span marked by violence, disease and ignorance. People who work for the end of poverty and relief from disease are fighting against nature. I hope they leave their lights on.
Here in Ontario, through the use of pollution control technology and advanced engineering, our air quality has dramatically improved since the 1960s, despite the expansion of industry and the power supply.
If, after all this, we are going to take the view that the remaining air emissions outweigh all the benefits of electricity, and that we ought to be shamed into sitting in darkness for an hour, like naughty children who have been caught doing something bad, then we are setting up unspoiled nature as an absolute, transcendent ideal that obliterates all other ethical and humane obligations.
No thanks.
I like visiting nature but I don’t want to live there, and I refuse to accept the idea that civilization with all its tradeoffs is something to be ashamed of.

"The US military’s carbon bootprint is enormous. Like corporate supply chains, it relies upon an extensive global network of container ships, trucks and cargo planes to supply its operations with everything from bombs to humanitarian aid and hydrocarbon fuels. Our new study calculated the contribution of this vast infrastructure to climate change. Greenhouse gas emission accounting usually focuses on how much energy and fuel civilians use. But recent work, including our own, shows that the US military is one of the largest polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries. If the US military were a country, its fuel usage alone would make it the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, sitting between Peru and Portugal. In 2017, the US military bought about 269,230 barrels of oil a day and emitted more than 25,000 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide by burning those fuels. The US Air Force purchased US$4.9 billion worth of fuel, and the navy US$2.8 billion, followed by the army at US$947m and the Marines at US$36m. It’s no coincidence that US military emissions tend to be overlooked in climate change studies. It’s very difficult to get consistent data from the Pentagon and across US government departments. In fact, the United States insisted on an exemption for reporting military emissions in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. This loophole was closed by the Paris Accord, but with the Trump administration due to withdraw from the accord in 2020, this gap will will return. Our study is based on data retrieved from multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to the US Defense Logistics Agency, the massive bureaucratic agency tasked with managing the US military’s supply chains, including its hydrocarbon fuel purchases and distribution. The US military has long understood that it isn’t immune from the potential consequences of climate change – recognising it as a “threat multiplier” that can exacerbate other risks. Many, though not all, military bases have been preparing for climate change impacts like sea level rise. Nor has the military ignored its own contribution to the problem. As we have previously shown, the military has invested in developing alternative energy sources like biofuels, but these comprise only a tiny fraction of spending on fuels. The American military’s climate policy remains contradictory. There have been attempts to “green” aspects of its operations by increasing renewable electricity generation on bases, but it remains the single largest institutional consumer of hydrocarbons in the world. It has also locked itself into hydrocarbon-based weapons systems for years to come, by depending on existing aircraft and warships for open-ended operations. Climate change has become a hot-button topic on the campaign trail for the 2020 presidential election. Leading Democratic candidates, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, and members of Congress like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are calling for major climate initiatives like the Green New Deal. For any of that to be effective, the US military’s carbon bootprint must be addressed in domestic policy and international climate treaties. Our study shows that action on climate change demands shuttering vast sections of the military machine. There are few activities on Earth as environmentally catastrophic as waging war. Significant reductions to the Pentagon’s budget and shrinking its capacity to wage war would cause a huge drop in demand from the biggest consumer of liquid fuels in the world. It does no good tinkering around the edges of the war machine’s environmental impact. The money spent procuring and distributing fuel across the US empire could instead be spent as a peace dividend, helping to fund a Green New Deal in whatever form it might take. There are no shortage of policy priorities that could use a funding bump. Any of these options would be better than fuelling one of the largest military forces in history.

The 2010 Olympics, held in the largest city ever to host a Winter Games, have not gone completely according to plan.



Before the games even began, organizers lamented how Washington, D.C., was getting a surfeit of snow that would have helped certain venues. Then, a luger lost his life to a track that was apparently both the fastest in the world and the one with the least padding. Then the fourth arm that was to hold the Olympic cauldron failed during the opening ceremonies. Finally, as I personally observed, ice conditions detracted from several promising speed skating events.



Apart from these real concerns, however, political activists and their media enablers remind us of how drugs, commercialism and the threat of terrorism have spoiled the world’s preeminent athletic event. Columnists lament the passing of a purer age, when doctors trained to run four‐​minute miles in their spare time, when competition was its own reward and a medal brought national glory rather than celebrity endorsement contracts. These Cassandras habitually predict the demise of the Olympics as modern society wreaks havoc on the sacrosanct traditions of the ancients.



But this prediction is based on bad information; politicians’ beliefs that the games should promote a kinder, gentler, unified world reflect romanticized history. Since the end of the Cold War, the Olympics have thrown off the corrosive chains of ideological battle to revert to the values of the original Games, among which were the dominance of the personal over the national, the economic over the political, and the athletic over larger concerns of the state.



The standard view of the Greek Olympics as a halcyon festival bringing amateur sportsmen together in the name of peace and brotherhood is a remnant of 19th‐​century Romanticism, which was institutionalized by aristocrats like modern games founder Pierre de Coubertin. Adolf Hitler, who staged the 1936 Berlin Games as a testament to the German people — and invented the torch relay in the first place — was taken in by a similar Olympic vision of nationalism via physical perfection.



The ancient reality could not have been further from these modern misconceptions, however, as Greek armies routinely violated the Olympic truce, and battle sometimes took place in the Olympic sanctuary itself. Individualism and athletic prowess were valued much more than mere participation, and wealth superceded ideology.



Pindar, the lyric poet whose victory odes tell us much of what we know about the early Olympians, wrote at the behest and patronage of wealthy athletes, who sought personal glory rather than the vindication of their city‐​state and its political system. And the great champion Alcibiades used his prestige to gain fame and riches, often at the expense of his “national interest.”



Further, the ancient heroes were Panhellenic — Athenian kids cheered for a Spartan Lindsay Vonn — and the victors’ olive wreaths were intrinsically worth about as much as the medals doled out in Vancouver.



The modern games, as they developed during the Cold War to allow politics to overshadow sports, broke with their predecessors. Mexico City hosted the 1968 Olympics amid the tumult of student uprising around the globe. Black Power made its presence felt on the victory podium with a barefoot gloved‐​fist protest. Subsequent Olympiads reflected the expansion and retrenchment of communism, along with guerilla warfare and counter‐​revolution in Latin America.



The Games of 1972 succumbed to the most dastardly terrorism ever visited upon the Olympics, with Palestinian jihadists’ murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in Munich. The 1976 Montreal event, which left a trail of debt that Quebec taxpayers only recently paid off — and for which British Columbia taxpayers now brace themselves — saw the first of a series of boycotts, this time by 30 African countries protesting apartheid.



As the Soviet Union and its vassal states succeeded in using the games as a showcase for ideological superiority, and the Western world lay mired in stagflation and cynicism, the Olympics lost their ancient bearings.



Though nobody knew it at the time, the 1988 Seoul Olympics were a watershed. These games followed the tit‐​for‐​tat superpower boycotts in Moscow and Los Angeles and were the first to be free from major political turmoil since Tokyo in 1964. More importantly, they represented the last Olympiad of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall falling the next year, followed by the dissolution of the Evil Empire, German reunification, and the New World Order of globalization.



The 20th century took us through almost continual political upheaval — not least within the Olympics — with most of it defined by the bipolar Cold War mentality and the specter of nuclear Armageddon. With that edifice of pretension eroded, the games were free to become athletic spectacles again.



Under today’s conditions of globalization — cultural homogenization, economic interdependence, decline of the nation‐​state even with respect to our enemies in war — international athletic competition assumes an ever‐​more parallel course to that of world society at large. As with all sporting events, the Olympics of the past two decades have become exponentially more entertainment‐​oriented. Even the proliferation of crass commercialism is a positive step because it returns the Olympics to the role they fulfill best: providing a forum for the finest athletes in the world to compete for fame and riches, while showing the rest of us a good time.



The Olympics now bring us the absolute best, without regard to color, creed, contract, or the Iron Curtain. The nature of the Olympic “movement,” meanwhile, has returned to the entertainment, ritual, and indeed athletic value of the original games. Gone is the sham of amateurism, as athletes are once more individuals, not tools of the state.



Tradition meet meritocracy; Coubertin meet Milton Friedman. Counter the conventional punditry, the symbiotic relationship between sports and society has thankfully returned to its original, proper status under the ancient Greeks.



Returning to 2010, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge was correct to quip ironically that his leadership group should have urged something other than the “greenest Games” (perhaps by avoiding temperate climates like Vancouver — or 2014’s Sochi, Russia?). It is of course tempting for these unaccountable IOC grandees to hitch their star to the ~~global warming~~ climate change fad, but that doesn’t mean they should be immune from criticism for using a glorious athletic competition for peddling utopian myths.

The angry Left has been calling for President Obama to fire Jeffrey Immelt from his position as head of the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. I think that would be a good idea, but for different reasons.   
  
Sen. Russ Feingold, Moveon.Org, and the regular scribes at the _Huffington Post_ see Immelt, the chairman and CEO of General Electric, as unfit to advise the president because GE invests some of its resources abroad and, despite worldwide profits of $14.2 billion, paid no taxes in 2010. No illegalities are alleged, mind you; GE — like every other U.S. multinational — responds to incentives, including those resulting from tax policy and regulations concocted in Washington.   
  
But there are more substantive reasons for why Immelt is unfit to advise the president. In particular, GE is a major player in several industries that President Obama has been promoting as part of his administration’s cocksure embrace of industrial policy. With over $100 billion in direct subsidies and tax credits already devoted to ""green technology,"" President Obama is convinced that America's economic future depends on the ability of U.S. firms to compete and succeed in the solar panel, wind harnessing, battery, and other energy storage technologies. Concerning those industries, the president said: ""Countries like China are moving even faster... I'm not going to settle for a situation where the United States comes in second place or third place or fourth place in what will be the most important economic engine of the future.""   
  
Well, just yesterday GE announced plans to open the largest solar panel production facility in the United States, which nicely complements its role as the largest U.S. producer of wind turbines (and one of the largest in the world). The 2011 _Economic Report of the President_ describes the taxpayer largesse devoted to subsidizing these green industries: 



[T]he Recovery Act directed over $90 billion in public investment and tax incentives to increasing renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, weatherizing homes, and boosting R&D for new technologies. Looking forward, the President has proposed a Federal Clean Energy Standard to double the share of electricity produced by clean sources to 80 percent by 2035, a substantial commitment to cleaner transportation infrastructure, and has increased investments in energy efficiency and clean energy R&D.



And Box 6.2 on page 129 of the _2011 ERP_ conveniently breaks out those subsidies by specific industry, most of which are spaces in which GE competes.   




Tim Carney gave his impressions of this budding relationship between GE and the Obama administration in the _DC Examiner_ last July: 



First, there’s the policy overlap: Obama wants cap-and-trade, GE wants cap-and-trade. Obama subsidizes embryonic stem-cell research, GE launches an embryonic stem-cell business. Obama calls for rail subsidies, GE hires Linda Daschle [wife of former South Dakota Senator and Obama confidante Tom Dachle] as a rail lobbyist. Obama gives a speeeh, GE employee Chris Matthews feels a thrill up his leg. I could go on.



And Carney does go on in a December 2009 _Examiner_ piece: 



Look at any major Obama policy initiative — healthcare reform, climate-change regulation, embryonic stem-cell research, infrastructure stimulus, electrical transmission smart-grids — and you'll find GE has set up shop, angling for a way to pocket government handouts, gain business through mandates, or profit from government regulation.



One month after President Obama proposed subsidizing high-speed rail because, in his words, ""everybody stands to benefit,"" the head of GE’s Transportation division proclaimed, ""GE has the know-how and the manufacturing base to develop the next generation of high-speed passenger locomotives. We are ready to partner with the federal government and Amtrak to make high-speed rail a reality.""   
  
About the optics of these related events, Carney writes: ""This was typical — an Obama policy pronouncement in close conjunction with a GE business initiative. It happens across all sectors of the economy and in all corners of GE's sprawling enterprise."" And he goes on to list other examples.   
  
Jeff Immelt should step down as head of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness because there is simply no avoiding a conflict of interest. Even if he recommends courses of action to the president that _don't_ advance GE's bottom line, it's hard to see how that wouldn't be an abrogation of his fiduciary responsibility to GE's shareholders.   
  
But more troubling is that Immelt and the president appear to be two peas in a pod when it comes to faith in government-directed industrial policy. Immelt admires the German model of industrial policy because the Germans believe in ""government and business working as a pack."" He admires China's ""incredible unanimity of purpose from top to bottom."" And days after Obama's inauguration, Immelt wrote to shareholders: 



[W]e are going through more than a cycle. The global economy, and capitalism, will be ""reset"" in several important ways. The interaction between government and business will change forever. In a reset economy, the government will be a regulator; and also an industry policy champion, a financier, and a key partner.



Citizens of a country that owes so much of its unmatched economic success to innovation and entrepreneurship and an absence of heavy-handed top-down mandates should be wary of the changes the presdient and Mr. Immelt are fostering.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Bernd Lucke, head of Germany’s AfD party, (Germany’s version of Britain’s UKIP), was interviewed by the National Anti Energy-Feed-In Act Movement (NAEB) and asked about his new party’s position on the Energiewende (transformation to renewable energy) and on climate science.

AfD head Bernd Lucke, right, calling for an exit from euro and scale-back of subsidies for alternative energies. Calls CO2 science disputed. Photo source: www.alternativefuer.de/.
The AfD party has been expressing doubts about climate science, and as a result has been viciously attacked by green and leftist thugs. To the greens and to leftists, the AfD represents a serious threat to the German climate movement, a movement that has been psychologically and emotionally bullied onto the public.
The entire interview appears at the site of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE). What follows are the pertinent excerpts.
NAEB: In Germany there are more than 200 citizens’ initiatives against wind parks in their neighborhoods, in nature reserves and in forests. Do you support these initiatives?
Lucke: These initiatives are there so that wind generators are not set up in natural parks or forests, and so that the distance between the wind generators and and residential areas are at least 10 times the maximum blade height. Those are sensible targets that merit support.

NAEB: So you want to scale back the construction of wind power, solar power and biofuel power. This will lead to job losses. Can we afford that?
Lucke: We have to look at the entire picture. By making the price of electricity more expensive, we are threatening to cause lots of job losses in the manufacturing sector. Because of the high costs of electricity, many companies are no longer working economically. They are moving their production facilities to less expensive foreign countries. The energy-intensive basic material industry employs about 2 million people. Currently many of the energy-intensive companies are exempt from the price-driving feed-in charges, but the unpredictable position of the German government and the latest demands by the Socialists are causing companies to worry that a cost explosion is imminent.
NAEB: Must we continue to further push the energy policy in order to rescue the world climate?
Lucke: You’re talking about the impact of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels on the global climate. How great this effect is, is scientifically disputed. It is possibly less than we thought. Of course it is necessary to be careful and to act responsibly.
NAEB: Back to electricity prices. Which dangers do you see coming from the constantly rising electricity prices in Germany?
Lucke: Germany’s energy policy is becoming increasingly unsocial. More or less every household has to pay the same price for electricity, no matter what the income is. The so-called Feed-In charges, which are responsible for the price increase, is like a tax that every household more or less has to pay equally. This is posing a danger for the social balance. Already today the Feed-In charges are causing a loss in buying power of 20 billion euros, by which low income earners are disproportionately impacted. That’s going to get worse if the electricity prices continue rising as planned.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving read the latest on the Greenpeace-30 activists detained by Russian authorities last month, I sense that they probably will be spending a few more years in prison than what some us thought just a couple of days earlier, just after it was announced that piracy charges would be dropped and that the activists would be facing the lesser charges of hooliganism.
The lesser charge was seen as a ray of hope. But that seems to be fading away.
Since then, the tones coming out of Russia have once again become notably harsher, with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov commenting. The German edition of Ria Novosti writes:
The arrested Greenpeace activists from the Arctic Sunrise vessel knew what they were getting themselves into. Now we simply have to wait for the court’s decision, so says Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
‘This action was planned. All those involved very well knew who and what they would photograph,’ said Lavrov.”
Obviously Lavrov thinks they are guilty of serious offences. These remarks by Lavrov weren’t reported in the English version of Ria Novosti.

The Russian media also points out that the Greenpeace activists also have other charges to worry about, in addition to the serious charge of hooliganism. The English language Ria Novosti writes:
Russian investigators earlier said some of the detained activists could face additional charges, including ‘assault on an official on duty.’
Russia seized the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and its multinational crew after several activists tried to scale an offshore oil rig belonging to Russia’s state-run gas giant Gazprom on September 18.”
Unfortunately, sympathy for the Greenpeace environmental activists is also running low in Russia. Ria Novosti writes:
Only 20 percent of Russians believe that the Greenpeace protest was actually in defense of the environment, whereas 42 percent think it was part of a conspiracy to take away Russia’s valuable natural resources, according to a survey released Monday by respected state-run pollster VTsIOM.”
Greenpeace management obviously had completely miscalculated in sending the activists out to protest in the Russian Arctic. When you take on Russia, you take on the whole system: judicial, political, and even the state-run pollsters. It’s awfully clear who is going to lose this one. The activists won’t be coming back anytime soon.

Prince Harry cut a sad and lonely figure walking behind his mother’s coffin in 1997.



Since then, he has served in Afghanistan, partied long and hard, worn a Nazi shirt, fallen in love a few times, and finally, married an American mixed-race actress and been congratulated for his diversity on his choice of bride. This young royal couple was set to blow away the cobwebs from the Royal Family… or so we were told at the time.



We’ve heard it all before though.



It is strange the way that Americans and the Royals never seem to mix well. While it is too early to say that this marriage is a disaster for the Royal Family, Harry is fast losing the enormous popularity and sympathy that he once enjoyed, and rightly or wrongly, his new wife is being blamed for that.



I don’t blame Meghan. Sure, she behaves like the princess she thinks she has become, but that is not entirely her fault. Harry needed to make sure she understood her role as part of the Royal Family, and clearly, he hasn’t had the heart – or the guts – to sit her down and tell her a few home truths.



He should have explained to her that, as a Royal, your life is never your own. Sure, they enjoy wealth and enormous privilege, but it all comes at a price. The public expects a piece of you, and the constant attention from members of the great unwashed is a price they have to pay for the life of luxury and respect that they enjoy.



After all, we all thought Meghan would cope well with the attention, unlike Harry’s former girlfriends, Chelsea Davy and Cressida Bonas, who apparently struggled with the constant media scrutiny.



Meghan, however, insists on having her cake and eating it, demanding privacy when it suits her and courting attention when she feels like it.



But keeping the details of Diana’s grandson’s birth private, including not announcing who the godparents are, is definitely not the way to endear oneself to the British public and it did not go unnoticed that the Queen did not attend Archie’s christening, citing a clash of engagements.



These events could have been rearranged. Everyone knows that. The Queen was sending a message that has neither been received or understood.



Since then, the Duchess (now known as ‘Duchess Difficult’) has snubbed President Trump on his UK visit, demanded that no one photograph her at Wimbledon because she was there in a ‘private’ capacity (on centre court attending a televised match), and issued decrees to neighbours at their home near Windsor not to approach them, not to ask to see Archie and not to pat their dogs.



You can just imagine how this is going down with the British people, who recently paid 2 million pounds for the renovations at Frogmore Cottage to be completed, can’t you?



Harry should know better. While we can understand his loathing of the media, after the way they hounded his mother, there are ways of reaching a happy medium, and issuing decrees to the public about keeping their distance is not the way to do it. The Cambridges manage to steer a path between privacy and public duty, and William and Harry had much the same upbringing.



The announcement this week that the Sussex’s are going to have no more than 2 children came as a bit of a relief because it is high handed and arrogant to treat the British public with such disdain on the birth of a royal baby.



However, this is why I have turned completely off Harry, probably for good.



Dozens of Hollywood A-listers, pop stars and royalty including Leonardo Di Caprio, Katy Perry and Prince Harry raise awareness of global warming by flying to Sicily in 114 private jets to attend a [Google Camp](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/07/31/irony-alert-global-elites-take-to-the-sea-skies-for-more-climate-talks/) on the theme of climate change. Did they think – what? – that we wouldn’t notice the irony here? 



There is an expectation that the Royals do not act extravagantly, as they are mostly funded by the British people, and can be severely criticised for spending taxpayers money unwisely. This is an act of arrogance and hypocrisy by our former favourite Royal.



Prince Harry confides that he is only going to have [two children](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/07/31/prince-harry-people-dont-understand-their-unconscious-bias/) by his current wife – ex- _Suits_ actress and _Vogue_ editor Meghan Markle – because any more would apparently be bad for the planet. (This is the same Meghan Markle – aka the Duchess of Sussex – who flew home by [private jet](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/meghan-markle-flies-home-by-private-jet-after-new-york-baby-shower-a4072641.html) earlier this year after travelling to New York for a baby shower) 



There is nothing like the hypocrisy of the left and the mega-rich.



And apparently, Harry turned up barefoot. What? Are shoes bad for the environment now?



It is clear that Harry has forgotten, and that Meghan never knew, that the purpose of the Royal Family is to serve its people. The British will support the Royals, so long as they see a benefit in having them around. After all, think of all the tourist dollars that could go into the post-Brexit coffers from guided tours of Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Balmoral, to mention just a few royal residences.



Unfortunately, this is all going to end badly. The Queen is going to have to intervene at some point and tell Harry and Meghan to pull their rather swollen heads in, or the Royals risk facing the wrath of the British people. This may well end in some form of exile for the Sussex family, as they take their demands for privacy and self-indulgence to unprecedented levels.



It’s funny though. Didn’t something like this happen the last time a royal married an American? History really does repeat, doesn’t it?

"**A party of 200 people at a halls of residence was broken up by police.**
The gathering in the courtyard outside St Peter's Court, Radford, which houses University of Nottingham students, stopped after midnight.
Nottinghamshire Police said officers were unable to arrest anyone as the crowd dispersed when they arrived, but they were still investigating.
It was one of a number of parties the force broke up overnight, prompting a plea to follow the rules.
Students across England are being tested next week as part of the government's plan to allow them to return home between 3 and 9 December.
Shortly after 21:00 GMT officers handed out five Â£200 fines after responding to reports of a party in a field in Gonalston.
They said they were still trying to find the organiser and a driver who crashed into a police car as they fled the scene.
At about 22:30 officers were called to a flat in Pilcher Gate, in the city centre, where they gave Â£200 fines to 21 people.
Shortly after 23:30 two people were arrested in Valley Road, Carlton, on suspicion of assaulting a police officer who had been at the scene of another illegal gathering.
Just after midnight officers broke up a ""large party"" in St Ann's and issued the organiser with a summons to appear in court.
Det Supt Andrew Gowan said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun.
""However, the current national restrictions are in place to protect the wider public from harm and we will keep enforcing them for as long as we need to.
""It is deeply disappointing that so many needed such an expensive reminder that the rules apply equally to everyone.
""We understand that this is a difficult time but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring the restrictions in such large numbers.""

The Greens conference at the weekend may have been mostly done behind closed doors, but snippets came out, including James Shaw calling Simon Bridges a **“climate change denier”.**



We all know Bridges is no denier, but his attitude towards climate change is somewhat more benign than that of the Green party.



Nevertheless, the Greens have announced a few things that will pave the way to reducing global warming… and it seems that, in New Zealand, we think that we can reduce the increase in global temperatures all by ourselves. Our Zero Carbon Bill requires New Zealand to go for the Paris Accord target of 1.5 degrees of warming, instead of the 2 degrees that most countries have adopted.



Nobody seems to have told Jacinda or James Shaw that our adopting the harsher Paris target will make absolutely no difference to global emissions, but the effect it will have on our economy could be devastating. 



So while it has been announced that the government vehicle fleet will be all-electric by 2026 and the infamous 1 billion trees will be planted by 2028, we all know that this will make little or no difference to global emissions. It is paying lip service really.



“Climate change is an urgent issue requiring an urgent response, to ensure a stable climate for future generations of New Zealanders,” Shaw said.



“Our Government is committed to a just and rapid transition to a low emissions economy, because it’s vital that we play our part looking after our planet.”



But if it is all so urgent, why wait until 2026 to replace the government fleet of vehicles? Why not save the planet and do it now? And why can’t we get Shane’s nephs off the couch to plant all those trees sooner?



(Please note the sarcasm level is high here… just in case you thought I was serious.) 



Work was “well under way” on fixing the Emissions Trading Scheme and establishing an independent Climate Change Commission,” Shaw said.



It was also working to reduce the price of electric cars.



The Government also wanted to be moving towards a goal of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2035.



By 2050, it wanted socially inclusive and compact cities, clean and clever energy generation and smart, sustainable farming practices using low emissions technologies.



  
All good stuff, James, but you are going to have to build several more dams for all this new electricity to be generated.



Oh, wait… isn’t it usually the Greens who object to new dams being built?



Speaking of those ‘smart, sustainable farming practices’, it is agriculture that is really going to be feeling the brunt of the Zero Carbon Bill, and agriculture is, of course, the backbone of our economy.



While all industries are expected to meet their emissions targets, agriculture has only 11 years to meet the first of its targets, unlike most other industry sectors that have until 2050. This robs agriculture of the time it will need to make technological advances, such as the production of genetically modified grasses that will reduce methane emissions from farm animals.



Don’t mention GM to the Greens either, as they are ideologically opposed to even thinking about the subject, even though it is the way forward to reducing methane emissions for agriculture.



That leads me to think that James Shaw’s idea of ‘smart, sustainable farming practices’ really only includes the growing of kale and mung beans, as anything else would be considered ecologically damaging one way or another.



Make no mistake though. A country like New Zealand, which is so reliant on agriculture for so much of its gross domestic product, is going to be badly affected by the assault on farmers, even though the effect on global emissions of each of these measures will be negligible.



If even the UK, which produces about 4% of global emissions, can do little to reduce temperatures on its own, we know for sure that we have no chance. Leading by example is not going to make China or India fall into line, no matter how much Jacinda wants it to be so.



That is not stopping this government, driven by ideology and not much else, from forcing farmers to adopt extreme emissions reductions which will not only not save the planet but will probably drive many of them off the land.



Be careful what you wish for, James Shaw. Agriculture provides a significant amount of tax revenue, which will never be replaced by the sale of mung beans. What are you going to do when that runs dry?

"Detailed century-old observations of penguin behaviour, including sexual activity so depraved and shocking it was recorded in Greek alphabet code, have been acquired by the Natural History Museum. Curators at the museum announced the purchase of original manuscript notebooks made by the explorer George Murray Levick, part of Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated Terra Nova expedition to the Antarctic in 1910-13.  As well as insights in to the unstoppable sex lives of penguins, they shine light on a remarkable story of survival and endurance with Levick forced to live in a cramped ice cave for seven months after he was unable to re-embark on the Terra Nova in February 1912. Douglas Russell, a senior curator of birds at the Natural History Museum, said the handwritten notes were a unique account of huge historical and zoological research interest. Together the notes represent the first major observations of an entire breeding season of an Adélie penguin colony. They are an exciting and important acquisition, Russell said. “Material such as this is often unavailable to researchers and now, for the first time, modern science has the opportunity to study Levick’s first-hand account and revisit his conclusions. “The importance of original manuscripts cannot be underestimated as they add crucial contextual and scientific data to our existing collections.” Levick was a young surgeon on Scott’s Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole and was entrusted with documenting the area’s natural history. “He is a hugely positive soul,” said Russell. “He is a nice chap. “He becomes completely obsessed with the Adélie penguin colony. One of the greatest joys in reading the notebooks is that, when the first birds arrive, you can tell the mounting excitement that he has. It is palpable in the pages … it blows his mind.” Levick was shocked by elements of penguin behaviour, documenting the excesses of young males, or “hooligan cocks”, in Greek alphabet code. These include necrophilia, sexual abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour. But that’s penguins for you. “The thing with penguins is that sperm is cheap,” said Russell. “They have one over-riding aim which is to fertilise and bring on the next generation … the birds will pretty much have sex with anything.” The notebooks are particularly important because the area Levick was studying, Ridley Beach on Cape Adare, is still home to around 335,000 Adélie penguins, the largest colony in the world. But, scientists predict, not for much longer. “As we see rising sea levels, it is highly likely that the entire colony will move. Part of the value here is that this is an account of an area that will one day be lost, it will all be reclaimed by the sea. “As a scientist, Levick was decades ahead of his time and now, more than 100 years later, his words still have much to tell us,” said Russell. The survival of the notebooks is all the more remarkable because of what Levick and five others endured after their time on Cape Adare when they were unable, after the death of Scott, to re-embark on the Terra Nova. Effectively marooned, they were forced to make an ice cave where they lived for seven months surviving on blubber and birds they had killed. After living in “utterly horrendous” conditions, Levick then walked 200 miles back to home camp. “His ability to weather this storm is extraordinary,” said Russell. “I do think there is a massive parallel for us all in that whatever we think of as isolation, we are nowhere near what Levick went through. Maybe it gives us the ability to look at things in context.” The announcement was made to coincide with world penguin day. The museum plans to make the notebooks physically and digitally available for future research, outreach and education Andrea Hart, head of special collections at the museum, said: “The Levick notebooks are a vital addition to our existing collection and the scientific observations held in original manuscripts such as these remain as relevant and important today as when they were first created. “We’re delighted that Levick’s work can now be accessed by academics, researchers and the public, more than a century after his seminal trip to Antarctica.”"

"Satellite images of the earth provide a striking picture of our planet during the hours of darkness. From space, the world at night appears as an intricate mass of tiny points of light, clustered into constellations of villages, towns and cities and linked by a spider-web of road networks. But can this be considered a form of pollution? What harm can light do to us or the environment? It was astronomers who first put forward the argument that excess light could be viewed as a form of pollution, obscuring our view of the night sky – observatories must be located far from the glow of city lights. But a growing body of evidence suggests that artificial light may have more profound effects on the environment than simply polluting our view of the stars. For nearly four billion years, life on earth has evolved under natural cycles of light – night and day, the phases of the moon and lengthening and shortening of days through the seasons. These cycles are hard-wired into the behaviour and physiology of animals and plants. They use the varying duration of daylight over the year as a cue to trigger seasonal events such as the breaking of buds for leaves and flowers in the spring, or mating and reproduction. The internal biological clocks that regulate 24-hour cycles of production of the hormone melatonin in humans and other animals, are constantly recalibrated by alternating periods of light and darkness. Melatonin plays a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles, chemically causing drowsiness when it’s time to sleep and lowering body temperatures when we’re out for the count. The division of time between day and night regulates periods of activity and rest in animals – when to hunt or forage and when to sleep. And faint natural light sources help nocturnal animals to orientate and navigate. Recent research has shown, for example, that dung beetles use the faint trace of the Milky Way to find their way.  The effects of introducing artificial light into these complex relationships can be profound, affecting the whole gamut of species. A few examples: we now know that urban light at night can advance egg laying in blue tits and bring forward the development of reproductive organs in blackbirds.  Light pollution can disrupt the annual migration of salmon, restrict the nightly movements of bats and increase mortality in young shearwaters and turtles. It can also change the foraging behaviour of wading birds  and cause deciduous trees to produce leaves earlier in the spring and retain them later in the autumn. Street lighting changes affect the structure of natural food chains. One study on grass verges under street lights found significantly higher numbers of predatory invertebrates including ground beetles and spiders, as well as scavengers, such as ants and woodlice than in unlit patches. We are only beginning to understand how these impacts may have deeper, long term consequences for nature conservation, biodiversity and the health of our ecosystems. The simplest methods for reducing light pollution – like switching off or removing unnecessary outdoor lighting and only installing new lighting where there is a demonstrated need – have the added benefits of saving money and reducing carbon emissions. A suite of other ways to reduce the environmental impact of light, from the technologically advanced to low-tech, exist and could help to make progress. The main barrier to making these reductions is lack of awareness that artificial light can be a form of pollution. Also, it is assumed that a brighter, whiter night-time environment is always safer, aesthetically pleasing and more desirable – this shouldn’t be taken as a given, and the evidence backing up these claims is often contested. Preserving, where possible, darkness at night can help reverse some of the ill-effects that the explosion of light pollution in recent years is having on the environment. Plus, we’d all benefit from seeing more of the night sky’s natural beauty."

Now that health care is done (for the time being), expect global warming to be high on the Obama administration’s “to do” list. But cap‐​and‐​trade legislation and its alternative, a direct tax on carbon‐​based fuels, can’t be passed via “reconciliation” and are far short of the needed 60 Senate votes.



As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is itching to step in and dictate how and how much we can drive, fly, consume, or make. This the agency made clear in its “endangerment finding,” a necessary precursor to regulation, released last December.



Expect the administration to use 2010 global‐​temperature data as backup for the EPA’s regulatory power grab. Global temperatures shot upward around the beginning of this year thanks to El Niño, a warming of the tropical Pacific that takes place every few years. The average global temperature has a reasonable chance of beating the last high, set back in 1998 (also an El Niño year).



Meanwhile, a number of studies point to sources other than greenhouse gases as explanations for the modest warming trend of the late 20th century. This could doom the EPA’s finding. But do not expect it to go quietly.



The EPA did no scientific research of its own to buttress its endangerment finding, relying on the 2007 report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a similar “Synthesis Report” from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program as the basis for its conclusions. According to these reports:



Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid–20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [greenhouse gas] concentrations.



“Most” means “more than one‐​half,” and the IPCC says “very likely” means a probability of between 90 and 99 percent. This claim may have constituted the “settled” science of climate change in 2007, but things have become greatly unsettled since then.



The rise in global surface temperatures as measured by the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (yes, the “Climategate” folks) is 0.70 degrees Celsius since 1950, or a little over a tenth of a degree per decade. But the most recent refereed science literature argues otherwise.



Soon after the IPCC report, David Thompson and several others (including Climategate’s Phil Jones) published a paper in _Nature_ showing a cold bias in measurement of sea‐​surface temperatures from the early 1940s through the mid 1960s. Accounting for this drops the rise in temperature to 0.55 degrees Celsius.



At the time of the IPCC report, Canada’s Ross McKitrick and I published a paper in the _Journal of Geophysics_ showing that there was a clear and systematic “non‐​climatic” warming — from changes in land use and problems with station maintenance — in temperatures measured at weather stations. The bias isn’t all that much when measured globally, but it subtracts another .08 degrees Celsius, leaving 0.47 degrees Celsius.



Earlier this year, Susan Solomon of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published a bombshell in _Science_ in which she argued that the lack of recent warming was likely due to fluctuations in water vapor way up in the stratosphere — changes that bear no obvious relationship to greenhouse‐​gas emissions. Given the limited stratospheric data that we have going back to 1980, her finding reduces the remaining trend to 0.41 degrees Celsius.



In 2008, V. Ramanathan of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography summarized the scientific literature on the emissions of black carbon (aka “soot”) and concluded this was responsible for about 25 percent of global warming. Carbon particles are _not_ greenhouse gases. This drops the supposedly greenhouse‐​gas‐​caused warming to .31 degrees Celsius — 44 percent of the original 0.70.



Note that it’s not even necessary to bring in variations in the sun in order to ascribe more than half of the warming to non‐​greenhouse changes.



So, where are the studies refuting these findings? They don’t exist. The EPA is wrong. The IPCC was wrong, too, that it is “very likely” that “most” of the warming since 1950 is from greenhouse‐​gas changes. The EPA has lost the scientific linchpin of its proposal to regulate our lives.



While the president will surely brandish the El Niño–driven warmth of 2010 as the reason for the EPA to regulate where the Senate can no longer act, the EPA needs to accept that the “settled” science of global warming has shifted tectonically since the last IPCC report.

"**With a number of potential vaccines for Covid-19 now imminent, there are increasing concerns that misinformation online could turn some people against being immunized.**
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the world's not only fighting the pandemic, but also what it calls an ""infodemic"" - where an overload of information, some of it false, makes it difficult for people to make decisions about their health.
And it's trying to answer people's concerns about the vaccines - as well as helping people evaluate the information they see on social media.
Nina, who is 21 and lives in London with her 82-year-old grandmother, is one of those who has concerns,
She says she has ""mixed feelings"" about Covid vaccines.
Nina, who is a freelance producer, isn't sure yet if she'll be vaccinated in the future. But she thinks the amount of information around makes it harder to understand the science behind the vaccines.
""Obviously like everyone I want this virus to go away as quickly as possible,"" she says.
""But at the same time, I'm not sure how much I trust the vaccine yet, because it's happened so quickly.""
And her view is partly coloured by what she sees on social media, although she also says she seeks out information from ""traditional"" news sources.
""There are quite a lot of opinions flying around on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. I think people are very easily influenced by that,"" she says.
Oscar Hodgson, a trainee solicitor who is taking part in a coronavirus vaccine trial at Imperial College London, says: ""It's often very difficult with the amount of information that we are being bombarded with to make sense of what you should be doing.""
But he adds: ""I think a vaccine is one of the only ways out of the situation if we want to get away from endless lockdowns and curfews.""
Researchers have moved at record speed to develop vaccines, less than a year in to this pandemic,
The WHO is monitoring data from more than 200 vaccine trials.
""There are now several types of vaccine in the pipeline based on different technologies,"" says Dr Sylvie Briand, the WHO's director of pandemic and epidemic diseases.
They are going through the same safety tests as vaccines already used all around the world.
""It's very expensive to do these phase three (human) trials. But many countries have come together to pay for it,"" Dr Briand says. ""When you have enough funds the process can go much faster.""
There are three key reasons it's been possible to develop coronavirus vaccines so quickly:
Part of the problem, is that information about this pandemic has been coming out in dribs and drabs, as scientists make new discoveries about the virus and how best to manage it.
This, researchers say, has created space for misinformation to thrive.
""People are looking for information, and they're confronted with this confusing mix of some credible information, and then a lot of other very questioning, undermining or outright wrong information."" says Prof Heidi Larson who runs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
She has been studying vaccine confidence around the world for more than two decades.
While vaccine hesitancy has always been an issue, she is very concerned about the impact misinformation appears to be having on people's intention to take coronavirus vaccines.
Her team carried out a recent study looking at vaccine confidence in the UK and US.
Of 4,000 people in the UK. 54% said they definitely would be vaccinated. But after they were shown inaccurate claims about vaccine safety that figure fell by over six percentage points
And people on lower incomes and from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were most likely to reject a Covid vaccine.
**How to identify inaccurate information online:**
SOURCE: WHO
""We've had an incredibly hopeful month with some of the new vaccine news,"" Prof Larson says.
""But we still don't have any proven vaccines. So we need to manage the hope.
""And one of the big anxieties is safety. So we can talk about the safety processes and the fact that those tried and tested processes are being followed carefully, with shortcuts in other parts of the long development process.""
Prof Larson, along with the WHO and governments around the world, is working with some of the big tech companies to try and combat misinformation.
Facebook - which owns Instagram and WhatsApp - says it removes information that could lead to ""immediate harm"", including false claims about cures for Covid-19.
It also says it's banned ads that discourage people from getting vaccines, and reduced the number of people who see vaccine hoaxes.
But, it's still pretty easy to come across misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines online, and to share those posts.
""We need to focus on building resilience, and filling that space"" said Prof Larson.
""You can't just take away pieces of misinformation without providing some alternative."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been a cold 2013 so far in Central and Western Europe. Last weekend snow fell in Austria, Germany, and the Czech Republic.

Global warming in France in June! Photo credit: Nicolas Guionnet, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Europeans are wondering whatever happened to global warming. Climate institutes, who just years ago predicted warm, snow-less winters, have turned 180° and are now insisting that the Little Ice Age-like conditions that have gripped Europe over the last 5 years are actually signs of global warming after all! Fortunately, very few people believe them.
Not only has snow become more frequent in the winter, but now ski slopes in the French Pyrenees are reporting that they will be open for (snow) skiing in June – the first time in history the French Local here reports.
A combination of a icy winter and a chilly spring has meant that for the first time ever in the month of June, skiers will have the option of heading to the pistes in the French Pyrenees, French TV TF1 reported on Wednesday.”

Remember how super-computer climate models predicted snow being rare and would end much of the European ski industry? Precisely the opposite is happening (my emphasis):
The Pyrenees witnessed heavy snow falls throughout the winter that led to regular avalanche alerts being put in place and at point in the ski season stations had to close because there was too much snow.”
This is hilarious. A climate scientist just couldn’t be made to look more foolish. Well, take that back. They are making themselves look even more foolish: Now they are claiming that all the cold and snow is global warming!
The Local ends but offering a small ray of hope to once warm and sunny France and Spain: “…there is hope the sun might make an appearance in France in July and August.”

"**Rita Ora says she's ""deeply sorry"" for breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday.**
The singer says she attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday.
""Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,"" she wrote in a statement.
It's reported up to 30 people were at the party, although she describes the event as a ""small gathering"".
She says it was a ""spur of the moment"" decision.
London's Metropolitan Police confirmed officers went to the Casa Cruz restaurant after a report about a potential breach of Covid lockdown regulations.
""I'm deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk,"" she posted.
""This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement.""
Current lockdown regulations in England mean you can only meet one other person outside.
Pubs and restaurants are currently closed (although they can serve non-alcoholic takeaways) and you shouldn't be with people from outside your house or support bubbles indoors.
Police have the power to break up groups larger than six and those who ignore officers could be fined Â£100, doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200.
So far, the singer has not been fined.
Kensington and Chelsea Council, which is responsible for issuing Covid fines against businesses in the area, says it is still investigating what happened at Casa Cruz.
The singer's not the first high-profile public figure to admit breaching lockdown. In October, Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham apologised ""for the naivety shown"" in attending a party for his 23rd birthday.
In May, Manchester City's Kyle Walker wrote to the club's supporters after breaching coronavirus restrictions.

The Arabunna people live in the area around Lake Eyre in Southern Australia. It is a hot, hostile desert region, which is no surprise, because … well … it’s in Australia. Here’s the general area where they live:
Figure 1. Lake Eyre region in South Australia. Yellow line show the area from 25°-30°S, 135°-140°E
A new report from the University of Everybody-Panic is a study of the horrendous future faced by these poor folks:
The first stage of University of Adelaide research released today shows that South Australia’s Arabunna country, which includes Lake Eyre in the far north, is likely to get both drier and hotter in decades to come.
“Temperatures could increase up to four degrees Celsius in Arabunna country in the next century, threatening the survival of many plants and animals,” says the author of the report, Dr John Tibby from the University of Adelaide’s Discipline of Geography, Environment and Population. SOURCE: PhysOrg
Yes, temperatures “could” increase … and I could win the lottery, but I’m not quitting my day job just yet. Meanwhile, back in the real world, what’s been happening in the Lake Eyre region in the last thirty years? Figure 2 shows the satellite-derived temperature trends for the lower troposphere in the area around Lake Eyre, from both the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Services (RSS).

Figure 2. Satellite temperatures for the lower troposphere in the Lake Eyre Region of Southern Australia. Photo shows the approach to Lake Eyre. Temperatures are the average of the region outlined in yellow in Figure 1. All data from KNMI
So … here’s the deal. We have no evidence that the temperatures are rising in the Lake Eyre region. There has been little change in the area temperatures since the satellite records began. Despite that, University of Adelaide professors are selling their fantasies of a terrifying future to the Arabunna, the aboriginal people who live in the area.
Meanwhile, the temperatures in the region are currently lower than they have been in the entire satellite record …
The professors seem to find nothing wrong with scaring the aboriginal people who have lived there for generations. And where do their projections of a 5°C temperature rise originate? Well, as usual, it’s models all the way down, and even the modelers say that their models are useless at the regional level … but despite that, these professors from the University of East Wankerton or wherever it is are more than happy to use these useless models to terrify the local folks.
I find this kind of crying wolf reprehensible, particularly when it is aimed at indigenous people, but hey, that’s just me.

We’ve known for some time that the eco-minded tend to think that humans are a bad thing. For example, there’s the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement:

That’s no joke, it is a real organization. What follows is something I thought was just a  clever April Fools Joke, but sadly turns out to be only too real. So real in fact, it may be powerful enough to buzzkill all the effects of a Barry White album.


No, it isn’t an April fools joke. The website and the product is real, which you can see here.
They even have a distributor network, and unsurprisingly, the land of fruits and nuts is ground zero.

The caption for the polar bear wrapper reads:
POLAR BEAR 
An international icon of global warming, the polar bear is going extinct as the Arctic sea ice melts beneath its feet because of the greenhouse gas emissions of 7 billion people — especially those in high-consumption nations like the United States. The bear was put on the U.S. endangered species list in 2008.
Some of the other wrappers are hilarious here’s another:
DWARF SEAHORSE 
This inch-tall, curly-tailed fish occurs only in shallow seagrass areas in the Gulf of Mexico, along the Atlantic Coast of Florida and in the Caribbean. Unfortunately, as the Gulf gets more crowded and industrialized, this seahorse faces more threats to its existence. Widespread loss of seagrass habitat due to pollution, boat damage and global war.
Maybe we could get Josh to come up with some condom wrapper art for the climate skeptic movement.
I’m thinking of some slogans like:

Party like its 1999 (before GISS adjustments).
Hot times ahead – NOT!
My head just exploded! Romm bam, thank you ma’am!
The heat is missing, and it’s a travesty!
Use before hiding the decline

Discretion, please, in comments – Anthony

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhy is CO2 Rising – Part 2
By Ed Caryl
How much biosphere has been destroyed? Deforestation is a large loss to the biosphere. From Wikipedia:
Global deforestation[92] sharply accelerated around 1852.[93][94] It has been estimated that about half of the Earth’s mature tropical forests—between 7.5 million and 8 million km2 (2.9 million to 3 million sq. mi.) of the original 15 million to 16 million km2 (5.8 million to 6.2 million sq. mi.) that until 1947 covered the planet[95]—have now been destroyed [2][96].”

 
In the 24 years from 1988 to 2012, Brazil alone destroyed 400,000 square kilometers of Amazon rainforest, though that estimate may be low. The good news is that this forest loss has now subsided from over 26,000 sq. kilometers in 2004, to a mere 5000 or so sq. kilometers last year. The forest burners have now moved to Indonesia to make room for oil palms for “green” energy.
The estimate is that 500 million metric tonnes of carbon each year are released into the atmosphere from the Amazon alone from slash fires and decomposition of slash piles. (Slash: The leftover stumps, limbs, and other waste from forest clearing, including selective logging waste.) The Amazon is half of the tropical rain forest. Each hectare of intact Amazonian rain forest contains 190 metric tonnes of carbon, so that 500 million tonnes represents 26,300 square kilometers of forest, the amount destroyed in 2004, so the figures match.


<!--

//-->




500 million tonnes represents about half the tropical rain forest destroyed, so the total tropical forest annual destruction may be 1 gigatonne of carbon. Russia destroys about as much temperate forest as Brazil does tropical forest, and Russia represents about half the temperate forest destroyed per year. The total is the 2 gigatonnes of carbon each year that is mentioned on the NOAA chart as “land use changes”.
The problem with destroying forest to convert the area to some other use, is that forest soils, whether tropical or temperate, are very poor. Amazonian rain forest soils, when cleared, typically can grow a crop for a year or two, if the burned vegetation ash is returned to the ground. when the forest is removed erosion can wash away the thin topsoil, further depleting fertility. Then the best use of the ground is as cattle pasture, but then the soil turns into a hard, compacted laterite clay surface that cannot be plowed. Reversion to forest is very slow if it happens at all. After 25 years, the average carbon content of soil and above surface vegetation is about 26 metric tonnes per hectare, about 14% of the original carbon. Details here. A tropical forest destroyed is destroyed for a very long time.
The problem with this subject is that there is little accurate data on how much forest is being destroyed per year. The overall uncertainty is a factor of two. Is the contribution to annual carbon emissions 10% or 20% of the total? Oh, and who is doing the cutting? The mafia (or similar), pirates, organized crime. Now think about oil palms, government subsidies…
In the long term, forest destruction has two impacts on the biosphere: It emits a large fraction of the total carbon emitted, and that area destroyed no longer contributes very much to carbon sequestration.

I return to the Wikipedia quote above. If half the primary forest on earth has been lost, then the 120 gigatonnes carbon on that diagram above is changing over time. If that 120 gigatonnes of carbon returning to vegetation has been shrinking by two percent per year, that would account for all the increase in carbon dioxide in the last 50 years. The good news is that it is possible to turn that situation around very quickly with improved forest management, law enforcement, and replanting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust how radical has the environmental movement become in Germany?
Well, to give you an idea, Germany’s Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environment Agency), or UBA, which is Germany’s version of the EPA, recently issued a 122-page pamphlet that fiercely defended the alarmists predictions of catastrophic global warming, and used harsh tactics to pillory skeptic US and German journalists and scientists. Read background here and here.

This 123-page pamphlet released by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) was written by authors who “have made themselves religious warriors” says German flagship business magazine WirtschaftsWoche. 
But since then, this form of raw, brute state intimidation has been met with harsh reactions from parts of the media, from the right, centre and left.
The latest harsh reaction comes from leading German business and financial magazine WirtschaftsWoche. The article concludes that the UBA has lost its objectivity and have become overzealous.
“Authors have made themselves religious warriors”
The winter and spring of 2013 have been unusually cold; the last 5 winters have been colder than normal, and so it is only natural that people are wondering if the global warming apocalypse is real after all. WirtschaftsWoche writes (my emphasis):
The Federal Environment Agency (UBA) and its President Jochen Flasbarth would like to prevent that question from leading to any doubt. […] In a targeted manner the UBA-authors are insinuating that skeptics, among them science journalists Michael Miersch of ‘Focus’ and Dirk Maxeiner, are either clueless or cozy with the fossil fuel industry. […]

The approach reveals that the issue is now being discussed ideologically instead of scientifically. Instead of being objective, the UBA authors have made themselves religious warriors.”
Another term for religious warrior could be “crusader”, or “jihadist” as in green jihadist. Whatever you choose, infidels like Maxeiner and Miersch are no longer to be tolerated in Germany under Angela Merkel, Peter Altmaier and Jochen Flasbarth. Maxeiner and Miersch, like the US and German scientists listed in the pamphlet, are today official targets of German state persecution.
Wirtschaftswoche also agrees that apparently the climate issue is indeed far from being settled after all, and openly wonders how the German state could think otherwise.
Much within the complex climate subject is still insufficiently understood by the scientists. Admitting that would enhance credibility. But instead of doing that, the UBA pamphlet suggests there is already certainty.The number of studies that are distancing themselves from the original IPCC horror scenarios are piling up.”
TAZ blogger: UBA “has lost every justification for existence”
Not only have major centre-right and centre-left media outlets blasted the UBA’s heavy-handed, one-sided tactics, but so has even a blogger from the very leftist TAZ daily. TAZ blogger Detlef Guertler posted at his site:
‘I understand this pamphlet to be an application to dissolve the Federal Environment Agency’, I wrote yesterday. And: ‘It’s frightening that the Federal Environment Agency has taken over the deplorable habit of Rahmstorfian black lists. Sinister effort.’ A federal agency that denounces single journalists as heretics of the ‘state of knowledge of climate science’ … has lost every justification for existence.”
Guertler feels so strongly about the UBA’s renegade tactics that he confessed agreeing with Henryk Broder’s characterization of the UBA as the Bundesklimakammer (Federal Climate Chamber).

Share this...FacebookTwitterGood news!
This is about one of the most damning pieces on the European climate movement I’ve read all year, and that from Germany’s equivalent of the Washington Post. An atmosphere of resignation is truly sweeping through Germany’s climate movement. Flagship media are waking up.
We’re winning!
“Failed tricking their way past democracy”
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) has written a blistering criticism of Hans Schellnhuber’s WBGU and climate activists’ efforts to impose a green authoritarian society over the rest of the world. They overshot and missed the curve. The FAZ introduction reads:
The rescue of the planet gets cancelled. The climate advisory council to the government played high stakes poker. And lost. They failed at tricking their way past democracy.”
In the eyes of one Germany’s leading flagship national dailies, the renowned FAZ, the attempted green coup led by a small group of elitist scientists and a mass of activists has come to grinding halt.
Germany and Europe again escape a (soft) tyranny – at least for the time being.
Background – the Potsdam doomsday factory
German professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber is the director of Germany’s infamously alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which includes alarmist climate radicals like Stefan Rahmstorf, Anders Levermann, and economist Ottmar Edenhofer. For years Schellnhuber’s institute has busily and relentlessly crafted data showing alarming climate change and putting out doomsday scenarios in an attempt to get spooked policymakers to stampede into enacting radical climate policy.
Schellnhuber is also the director of the WBGU, the German Advisory Council on Global Change. The Council is made up of nine “renowned scientists”. Their primary task: to advise policymakers in Germany and worldwide on how society should proceed in the face of dangerous climate change.
Master-plan for transforming global society
Three years ago the WBGU authored and released a 446-page “Master Plan” for “The Great Transformation of Global Society” designed to put global society on the fast-track to “sustainability” and an almost carbon-free society by 2050. In it the council even called for policies to water down democracy. One journalist once summarized: The WBGU is in favor of democracy, but only so long as the people make the right decisions.
The master-plan called for a so-called future council, made up of prophet-like wise men, who would have the power to veto democratic decisions it felt were not in the best interest of future generations.
“Climate protection as moral as abolishing slavery”
The FAZ writes that one of the fundamental aims of the WBGU was changing Germany’s constitutional law: climate protection was to become an official state priority and that going green was “as morally imperative as the abolition of slavery“. More importantly, the “transformation to a climate-protective society would have to happen very rapidly“. Dissenters would have to be stigmatized and marginalized, and so denied real participation.
Though highly controversial, the WBGU never backed down from their radical proposal, always insisting that the fate of the planet was in imminent peril, that there could be neither compromise nor delay, that time was of the essence, and the science was unanimous. The WBGU even called it a test for democracy, claiming that if society failed to act, it would tell us that democracy was no longer capable of functioning in the face of crisis.
“Failed to trick their way past democracy”
Since the release of the WGBU’s master-plan in 2011, most of the world has not heeded the council’s recommendations and CO2 emissions continue their rapid rise unabated. To the council members, democracy appears overwhelmed and no longer able to cope with the crisis of climate change. The FAZ asks: “Has democracy failed the test to check if it’s adequate for the future?” The FAZ answers:
Not at all. It appears much more so that the attempt by some climate-political advisors to the government to trick their way past democracy has failed.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




It’s truly encouraging that a major daily like the FAZ has come to realize this. We see that society once again indeed has narrowly escaped another tyranny.
“German climate movement is frustrated”
On the reaction by the WBGU scientists, the FAZ writes: “those who wanted to fire up the climate revolution are frustrated. And with them, the mainstream of the German climate movement.”
Germany gets a new heretic
The FAZ also writes how a new climate-policy heretic has entered the German climate policy scene, Dr. Oliver Geden. Geden, a warmist and a climate policy advisor to the German government, has been sharply critical of the WBGU misusing urgency to justify any means. He’s become the latest persona non grata. The FAZ writes:
By using time pressure, everything can be justified: billions in expenditures, gigantic conferences – and tampering with democracy. The good cause justifies the means.”
The FAZ describes how a green regime of the sort advocated by the WBGU would of course never force green living onto the citizenry by enacting authoritarian laws, but rather it would impose the green regime psychologically using campaigns that would teach citizens what good behavior is, e.g. vegetarianism, and marginalize dissenting behavior. In a nutshell, it would keep making the lives of dissenters miserable until they learned to choose correctly.
However, the FAZ shows this is a lot easier said than done, citing the German Green Party’s recent national election campaign where they demanded one “Veggie Day” a week be imposed in Germany. That issue backfired big time for the greens, who on election day lost hundreds of thousands of votes and ended up in the single digits. A recent poll showed that 61% of the public rejected a “Veggie Day”.
But the WBGU was not at all impressed by the public’s rejection. The FAZ writes that one WBGU scientist brushed the rejection aside, claiming the question should not have been posed in the first place and that cafeterias should just implement Veggie Day without even asking. “Just do it, and don’t vote on it,” the FAZ quips.
Climate policy has been “a giant failure”
For warmist think-tank member and government advisor Oliver Geden, the WBGU scientists have gone too far. FAZ:
He and other scientists feel many climate advisors have abused their role for years: Scientists acted like politicians who applied pressure and exercised power, and did not act like scientists who show solution paths.”
The FAZ quotes Geden regarding the policy approach taken by the WBGU:
The whole thing has been a giant failure.”
According to the FAZ, Geden constantly receives e-mails from agitated scientists who write that it’s “terrible to even express criticism” or that it’s the wrong time for criticism, “We’re close to a breakthrough!”
Mood of resignation taking hold in the green movement
At the end of the article the FAZ describes a mood of resignation that is sweeping across Europe’s climate movement. The FAZ concludes:
This year the nine scientists of the WBGU published a new book about the protection of the world’s oceans within the scope of the Great Transformation. In a mutual committee of the federal Ministries for Environment and Research, where they unveiled their results, there was not a single federal minister present, only state secretaries.”
Looks like the WBGU’s days have come and gone. Now is a good time to ask them: How does it feel not to be listened to?

The recent Cowtan and Way paper attempting to fill gaps in the Arctic surface temperature records by in-filling with satellite data has triggered many reactions in the blogosphere. Cowtan and Way claimed that the coverage gaps in the surface data resulted in a cooling bias that they attempted to correct with satellite derived data. Others have pointed out many failings in this paper, but have failed to note the biggest failing of all:
HUGE warming adjustment bias
The authors managed to identify a coverage bias without noting a HUGE warming adjustment bias in the surface temperatures. It is difficult to believe that they did not notice this as they were comparing the HADCRUT4 data to the satellite data. This failure totally falsifies their findings.
Here is a comparison of the GISS data for land and ocean for the region north of 60° latitude (very similar to HADCRUT4 data, but more accessible), compared to the RSS Satellite land and ocean data for the same latitudes.

Figure 1 is a plot of GISSTemp land and ocean temperatures and RSS TLT land and ocean data for latitudes north of 60°.
Others have pointed out that GISS data, and indeed all the surface temperature data bases, suffer from “homogenization” and “correction”, cooling the past and warming the present. There has been much less criticism of the satellite data because those measurements are derived in a completely different way. The surface temperature data from GISS, HADCRUT, and GHCN suffer from the same problem, a limited number of polar measurement stations (they all use the same ones). Because these stations are in very cold climates, they all suffer from varying degrees of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects – with Arctic stations being located located near buildings, air strips, etc. The satellites suffer much less from this problem because the polar regions are so thinly populated.
Note that in Figure 1 GISSTemp is warming about 75% faster than the satellite measurements. The divergence was small in the 1980’s, mostly confined to warm years, with less difference in cold years. But in the last decade, the difference has widened to more than a degree. Figure 2 is the bias in the GISS annual temperature data relative to the satellite data.

Figure 2 is the difference between the GISS data and the RSS data in Figure 1.
So why didn’t Cowtan and Way notice this warming bias? Rhetorical question – they didn’t want to!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago Switzerland’s flagship daily the NZZ also commented on the Otto et al paper, which indicates CO2 climate sensitivity was over-estimated and that the worst-case scenarios very likely aren’t going to take place.

Otto et al is just more hard evidence showing earlier models completely miss the barn. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.
What we are noticing from the NZZ article is that overall alarmism in Europe is diminishing, fast, even in the media. The title of the NZZ piece is: “Climate is reacting less sensitive to CO2 than thought“.
Recall that some alarmist scientists are still desperately insisting the climate catastrophe is coming, and that it’s just going to take a little longer to get here – like during our great-granchildren’s lifetime. But journalists in Europe are slowly waking up to all the wolf-crying. The cryers of wolf are looking more and more like the town fools. The more people walk away and stop listening to them, the shriller they get.
The report starts by explaining to readers what is meant by CO2 sensitivity, and then tells us the study’s new results:

In a new study on climate sensitivity, the authors ended up with comparably lower values: Their estimated central value is near 2°C of warming, a third less than the UN report.¹ However, the uncertainty is also large in the new study.”
The NZZ also tells readers that the Otto et al study is not just some isolated paper that is bucking a consensus of high CO2 sensitivity, but is “the latest in a number of papers” showing that the prognoses of global warming have been exaggerated. The NZZ quotes climate scientist Andreas Schmittner von der Oregon State University, who said that “most studies of last years have shown a somewhat lesser climate sensitivity“.
What’s more, the NZZ looks at the Transient Climate Response (TCR), which indicates how much the air will warm up by the time CO2 doubles. Here the NZZ writes that the authors project a short term climate reaction of 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels. “That’s 0.5°C warming from today“. The NZZ writes:
Several other recent studies had indicated an over-estimation. With the latest study, this finding is further solidified.”
Another point that the NZZ brings up is that the new study was not able to reduce uncertainty.
Looking at the above figure, one thing is certain: the observations so far show that all the models have been exaggerating and that even Otto et al’s newest estimation is likely to be an exaggeration itself.

From NCAR/UCAR, they’re still trying to stamp out solar influence as a potential cause of the Little Ice Age. One of the things I wonder about is that during low sunspot activity, does the reduced solar-magnetic influence have any effect on Earth’s plate tectoncs and vulcanism? Does a reduced solar-magnetic influence prompt more volcanism? We may get the answer to this question in the coming years as the Ap solar-geomagnetic activity index is at an all-time low in the records.

Study may answer longstanding questions about Little Ice Age
January 30, 2012

BOULDER — A new international study may answer contentious questions about the onset and persistence of Earth’s Little Ice Age, a period of widespread cooling that lasted for hundreds of years until the late 19th century.
Gifford Miller collects vegetation samples on Baffin Island. (Photo courtesy University of Colorado Boulder.)
The study, led by the University of Colorado Boulder with co-authors at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and other organizations, suggests that an unusual, 50-year-long episode of four massive tropical volcanic eruptions triggered the Little Ice Age between 1275 and 1300 A.D. The persistence of cold summers following the eruptions is best explained by a subsequent expansion of sea ice and a related weakening of Atlantic currents, according to computer simulations conducted for the study.
The study, which used analyses of patterns of dead vegetation, ice and sediment core data, and powerful computer climate models, provides new evidence in a longstanding scientific debate over the onset of the Little Ice Age. Scientists have theorized that the Little Ice Age was caused by decreased summer solar radiation, erupting volcanoes that cooled the planet by ejecting sulfates and other aerosol particles that reflected sunlight back into space, or a combination of the two. 
“This is the first time anyone has clearly identified the specific onset of the cold times marking the start of the Little Ice Age,” says lead author Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado Boulder. “We also have provided an understandable climate feedback system that explains how this cold period could be sustained for a long period of time. If the climate system is hit again and again by cold conditions over a relatively short period—in this case, from volcanic eruptions—there appears to be a cumulative cooling effect.”
“Our simulations showed that the volcanic eruptions may have had a profound cooling effect,” says NCAR scientist Bette Otto-Bliesner, a co-author of the study. “The eruptions could have triggered a chain reaction, affecting sea ice and ocean currents in a way that lowered temperatures for centuries.”
The study appears this week in Geophysical Research Letters. The research team includes co-authors from the University of Iceland, the University of California Irvine, and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, NCAR’s sponsor, and the Icelandic Science Foundation.
Far-flung regions of ice
Scientific estimates regarding the onset of the Little Ice Age range from the 13th century to the 16th century, but there is little consensus, Miller says. Although the cooling temperatures may have affected places as far away as South America and China, they were particularly evident in northern Europe. Advancing glaciers in mountain valleys destroyed towns, and paintings from the period depict people ice-skating on the Thames River in London and canals in the Netherlands, places that were ice-free before and after the Little Ice Age.
“The dominant way scientists have defined the Little Ice Age is by the expansion of big valley glaciers in the Alps and in Norway,” says Miller, a fellow at CU’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. “But the time in which European glaciers advanced far enough to demolish villages would have been long after the onset of the cold period.”
Miller and his colleagues radiocarbon-dated roughly 150 samples of dead plant material with roots intact, collected from beneath receding margins of ice caps on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. They found a large cluster of “kill dates” between 1275 and 1300 A.D., indicating the plants had been frozen and engulfed by ice during a relatively sudden event.
The team saw a second spike in plant kill dates at about 1450 A.D., indicating the quick onset of a second major cooling event.
To broaden the study, the researchers analyzed sediment cores from a glacial lake linked to the 367-square-mile Langjökull ice cap in the central highlands of Iceland that reaches nearly a mile high. The annual layers in the cores—which can be reliably dated by using tephra deposits from known historic volcanic eruptions on Iceland going back more than 1,000 years—suddenly became thicker in the late 13th century and again in the 15th century due to increased erosion caused by the expansion of the ice cap as the climate cooled.
“That showed us the signal we got from Baffin Island was not just a local signal, it was a North Atlantic signal,” Miller says. “This gave us a great deal more confidence that there was a major perturbation to the Northern Hemisphere climate near the end of the 13th century.”
The team used the Community Climate System Model, which was developed by scientists at NCAR and the Department of Energy with colleagues at other organizations, to test the effects of volcanic cooling on Arctic sea ice extent and mass. The model, which simulated various sea ice conditions from about 1150 to 1700 A.D., showed several large, closely spaced eruptions could have cooled the Northern Hemisphere enough to trigger the expansion of Arctic sea ice.
The model showed that sustained cooling from volcanoes would have sent some of the expanding Arctic sea ice down along the eastern coast of Greenland until it eventually melted in the North Atlantic. Since sea ice contains almost no salt, when it melted the surface water became less dense, preventing it from mixing with deeper North Atlantic water. This weakened heat transport back to the Arctic and created a self-sustaining feedback on the sea ice long after the effects of the volcanic aerosols subsided, according to the simulations.
The researchers set solar radiation at a constant level in the climate models. The simulations indicated that the Little Ice Age likely would have occurred without decreased summer solar radiation at the time, Miller says.

Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures over the past 8000 years have been paced by the slow decrease in summer insolation resulting from the precession of the equinoxes. However, the causes of superposed century-scale cold summer anomalies, of which the Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most extreme, remain debated, largely because the natural forcings are either weak or, in the case of volcanism, short lived. Here we present precisely dated records of ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a substantial intensification 1430-1455 AD. Intervals of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past millennium. A transient climate model simulation shows that explosive volcanism produces abrupt summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed. Our results suggest that the onset of the LIA can be linked to an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global sulfate loading >60 Tg. The persistence of cold summers is best explained by consequent sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer insolation minimum; large changes in solar irradiance are not required.

Is Scott Morrison handing out half a billion dollars in “go-away” money? Or buying Pacific loyalty?



Of course, it would impolite to tell the blunt truth these days. Instead, it’s being diplomatically described as “climate change funding”.



Scott Morrison will announce $500 million in climate change ­funding when he meets regional leaders in Tuvalu this week, in a bid to rescue his Pacific “step-up” from mounting anger over Australia’s domestic emissions policies.



The funding will be used to protect communities and infrastructure from rising seas and wor­sening storms, help nations ­recover after natural disasters and ensure local health services are better equipped to respond to changing needs.



Of course, it definitely **won’t** be used to buy any [fleets of luxury cars](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/first-maseratis-now-bentleys-for-apec-in-papua-new-guinea) for elites flying in for regional junkets.



The Prime Minister, who ­arrives in Tuvalu tomorrow for the Pacific Islands Forum, is facing a growing backlash from Pacific ­nations over emissions, with Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama yesterday branding climate change an “existential threat” to island nations and urging a rapid end to Australia’s reliance on coal.



His comments followed those of Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga on Sunday, who warned Mr Morrison’s standing among Pacific leaders was on the line over the climate change issue. But Mr Morrison said Australia was working to address its own emissions and would work with Pacific nations to help them cope with the impacts of global warming.



Australia’s emissions are nine-tenths of sod-all. We could completely cease all emissions tomorrow and it won’t make a jot of difference to the global climate, let alone sea levels. If Pacific nations were **really** worried about such things, they should be bullying China, India and the US. But they know perfectly well what the answer from the really big emitters will be. Far easier to morally blackmail Australia.



After all, it’s not like we’re not already throwing away money, hand over fist, on delusional green scams.



“The fact Australia leads the world in per capita investment in clean energy, we have the world’s most successful green bank in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and that we’re on track to have around a quarter of our electricity needs met by renewables by 2020, all underscores the work underway to reduce our global emissions.”



But, more than anything, this is really about the realities of geopolitics rather than catastrophist fantasies about climate change.



The Pacific “step-up” is one of the Prime Minister’s key priorities amid rising Chinese influence in the region and calls from the US for Australia to play a “great power leadership role” in its strategic backyard.



In other words, Australia is trying to buy Pacific nations’ loyalties before the Chinese do. While it’s a sensible strategy for Australia, it’s also a nice little earner for the Pacific: all they have to do is sit back and watch the big guys throw money at them.

"The last few surviving Asiatic cheetahs live in Iran, where they stalk the hyper-arid landscape, where temperatures swing from -30°C to 50°C. This is the only place in the world a cheetah, most of which live in Africa, will experience snow. Iran is home to the last known population of Asiatic cheetah, a creature which once roamed across vast ranges of west and south Asian countries, from the Middle East to India. Today, the cheetahs are known only from around 15 reserves in Iran, all officially protected by the country’s government. Together with genetic distinctiveness from their African cousins, the Asiatic cheetahs are smaller and more slightly built. Iranian biologists were surprised to learn that the Asiatic cheetahs are mainly found in mountainous regions – a very different proposition from the view expected from wildlife documentaries in which cheetahs pursue sprinting gazelles across open plains.  Camera traps are reliable tools to try to gauge the population of these spotted cats, whose markings are individually unique. However, this technology has been rarely applied to cheetahs across their global range due to the paucity of individuals and their elusive nature. Due to political sanctions, the necessary equipment is not easily available in Iran, and this has prevented a thorough assessment of the species in the past.  Thanks to various donors and partners, including Panthera and Dutch NGO Stichting SPOTS, a monitoring program was recently launched that would fill the gaps in our knowledge about the cheetah that is essential for its protection. Even so the results were surprising, revealing only 40 to 70 cheetahs across the country – smaller even than previous estimates of up to 100. Listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, the Asiatic cheetah is among the rarest cats in the world at subspecies level, after the Amur leopard.  Around 125 game guards protect the cheetah’s range in Iran as Cheetah Guardians, thanks to tremendous efforts of the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP), the Iranian Department of the Environment (DoE), and UNDP in Iran, which tried to double the number of guards employed by the DoE during the past decade. Equipped with 4WD vehicles and motorbikes, each guard is responsible for protecting around 640km2 of the landscape, an indication that more forces are needed. In order to safeguard the cheetahs, the DoE established more reserves while existing reserves received more resources. In the Iran’s northeast Miandasht Wildlife Refuge has been a key site for the cheetahs after a threefold boom in prey species. As a result, the cheetahs have established a breeding population there, vital to help re-colonise other reserves. As is the case for many wildlife species, the cheetah was little known among the public ten years ago. But with the animals’ plight appealing to the media it has garnered considerable coverage, leaving the public in no doubt about the state of the cheetah’s decline. With united effort from government and NGOs, this year the cheetah even became the first species to appear emblazoned on the Iranian national football team’s jersey during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. So as a symbol of the nation’s wildlife, the public awareness and support the cheetah receives is an important step to ensure its long-term survival. But it is not enough. It is vital to build an expert opinion on what to do about the species’ critically small population, rising mortality from human causes, such as traffic collisions, and falling birth rates.  While further research is needed, we know that Asiatic cheetahs have much lower genetic diversity than African cheetahs, but we are still hopeful that better connectivity between the various reserves to allow cheetahs to intermingle could maintain a basic level of gene flow between small cheetah populations.  We need the authorities to confront and defeat plans for property development and infrastructure such as roads, mines and railways within the main cheetah reserves. For example, a road to be constructed through Bafq Protected Area in central Iran was a major concern, but the DoE managed to stop construction and propose an alternative route. Cheetahs are known to kill small livestock, and claims of cheetahs killing young camel, sheep, and goat are rife among shepherds. Recent cases in different parts of the country have raised concerns that cheetahs could be killed by protective herders. At least five have been known to be killed by herders since 2010, twice the number killed in the previous decade. To try to prevent this, the Iranian Department of Environment and CACP established a programme to compensate for cheetah predation for five years. On August 31 1994 a cheetah was rescued from dying of thirst in central Iran. Named Marita, for nearly ten years she was the only evidence of the existence of cheetahs outside Africa. In 2007, the Iranian Cheetah Society (ICS) designated August 31 as National Cheetah Day, an annual event to draw people’s attention to conservation issues in Iran. The cheetah is lucky to have a day bearing its name, but to survive they will need much more than luck."
"Climate breakdown, mass extinctions, and extreme inequality threaten the earth’s rich tapestry of life and leave our own fate increasingly uncertain. At a time of such social, political and ecological upheaval, it’s natural to dream of a utopian world in which these problems are no more – in fact, people have been doing it for centuries.  Such visions are often dismissed as nothing more than pointless flights of fancy, yearnings for impossibly perfect societies. But these assumptions are largely incorrect. Utopianism is the lifeblood of social change, and has already inspired countless individuals and movements to change the world for the better. Utopia is not, as its Greek etymological roots suggest, a “no-place”. The name may derive from Thomas More’s classic 16th-century fictional work, Utopia, but it is not confined to literature depicting distant or fantastical ideal worlds. Utopianism is in fact a philosophy that encompasses a variety of ways of thinking about or attempting to create a better society. It begins with the seemingly simple yet powerful declaration that the present is inadequate and that things can be otherwise. Present in communities, social movements, and political discourse, it critiques society and creatively projects futures free of the strangleholds of the time. Put simply, it embodies a longstanding human impulse towards self-improvement. Utopianism is manifest in countless historical examples of those that have dared to challenge the status quo and assert that things can – and indeed, must – change. Take Martin Luther-King’s dream of a world free of racial segregation for example, or the strivings of the suffragettes for gender equality. Now, our relationship with the natural world is humanity’s defining challenge – and utopian ideas have shifted to meet it. “Ecotopian” aspirations are already in full view in community networks attempting to create more conscious ways of living such as the Transition Network, social movements such as Extinction Rebellion, and bold policy proposals such as the USA’s Green New Deal. What’s more, many of the ideas put forth by these projects were long since imagined in prominent ecotopian literary works. In the ideal worlds sketched in Ernst Callenbach’s Ecotopia and Kim Stanley Robinson’s Pacific Edge for example, resources are renewably sourced and communally owned. Healthcare, education, and meaningful employment are available to all. Extreme wealth disparities have been eradicated through income caps and minimum earnings schemes. These ideas are reflected in many aspects of the Green New Deal, which aims to transition the USA towards communal ownership of energy systems and a 100% renewable energy system by 2030, as well as enshrine into law rights to single-payer healthcare, guaranteed work at a living wage, affordable housing, and free university education. It’s not clear whether Alexandro Ocasio-Cortez, the leading figurehead for the grand policy package, was directly inspired by these works. But judging from the way she has been promoting the Green New Deal, she certainly sees the value in painting visions of utopia. For example, her viral video, titled “A Message from the Future”, creatively imagines a more socially and ecologically resilient society just a few decades on from now – and, crucially, helps us to believe that it is possible.  As a decentralised global movement that gives its members autonomy and demands politics in which citizens lead, Extinction Rebellion also echoes ideals from ecotopian novels. In Ecotopia and many other similar works, most aspects of life are decentralised, from small-scale agriculture to neighborhood-specific healthcare. In Pacific Edge, the direct brand of politics Extinction Rebellion advocates is central to social and ecological wellbeing. Extinction Rebellion urges efforts of wartime proportion to decarbonise by 2025 – a utopian target that has been met with scepticism in some quarters.  But whether or not it is achievable, such a demand has been crucial in highlighting that what is presently deemed politically possible is not sufficient to stop catastrophic climate breakdown.  Their radical visions have shifted the climate and ecological crises to the forefront of the political agenda. And, crucially, they have switched millions on to the idea that fundamental transformations in the way we organise and power our societies are possible. To some, the serious political proposals outlined by Extinction Rebellion and in the Green New Deal might seem as unrealistic as the literary works that imagine their realisation. But living examples of ecotopian imagination can already be found in the world we live in. Thousands of intentional communities across the globe are already creating spaces with social and ecological justice at their heart. Many of these eco-communities have been directly inspired by the communities imagined in ecotopian novels. For example, hundreds of eco-villages in the Baltic region were set up according to the concept laid out in Vladimir Megre’s The Ringing Cedars of Russia. Some movements, such as the Transition Network – whose co-founder describes himself as a “vision harvester” – are even working to transform existing settlements across the world, with great success. As just one example among initiatives in nearly 1,000 towns and cities, Transition Marlborough’s Bee Roadzz project in south-west England has drawn together local residents, businesses and organisations to link habitats and combat the rapid decline of bees and other pollinators.  In shattering the perceived rigidity of the present, utopianism paves the way for change. Perfect worlds may not be realisable or even desirable, but that doesn’t mean we should shy away from imagining and striving for a better future. Societies without extreme inequality and environmental degradation are surely within the bounds of possibility. Whether in the form of a creative novel, a social movement, or a political proposal, dreaming can help us get there. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest news on the sea-ice trapped MV Akademik Shokalskiy global warming research vessel comes from Radio Australia:
An Australian icebreaker has abandoned its attempt to rescue a Russian-flagged ship stuck in sea ice in Antarctica due to adverse weather conditions. […]
‘There could be further attempts if the master feels the weather conditions are OK to do that attempt, to get further into the ice fields.’
According to reports, the Australian ice breaker never got closer than 10 nautical miles to the global warming research vessel, and is now back out in open water 18 miles away, waiting for the weather to improve.
‘It’s blowing an absolute blizzard here, there’s a total white-out, there’s snow blowing everywhere and it’s damn cold outside,’ said expedition member John Black in his latest video message.”
Black also adds:
Expedition spokesman Alvin Stone says the group is not worried about spending New Year’s Eve on the ice.”

Of course not. They have lots of diesel fuel to keep the trapped vessel powered and warm. And who cares if the rescue efforts drag on and on. The taxpayers will simply foot the bill run up by all the foolishness.
The South China Morning Post here writes that a rescue by helicopter was also called off due to bad weather, snow and high winds.
Three hours ago, expedition leader Dr. Chris “Baghdad Al” Turney tweeted as he stood surrounded by miles of thick ice, “It’s so warm, it’s actually raining!” Everyone is just having a marvelous time, he assures.
See all the passengers bathing on deck in the warm sun?

"Denial never dies; it just goes quiet and waits. Today, after years of irrelevance, the climate science deniers are triumphant. Long after their last, desperate claims had collapsed, when they had traction only on “alt-right” conspiracy sites, a hero of the left turns up and gives them more than they could have dreamed of. Planet of the Humans, whose executive producer and chief promoter is Michael Moore, now has more than 6 million views on YouTube. The film does not deny climate science. But it promotes the discredited myths that deniers have used for years to justify their position. It claims that environmentalism is a self-seeking scam, doing immense harm to the living world while enriching a group of con artists. This has long been the most effective means by which denial – most of which has been funded by the fossil fuel industry – has been spread. Everyone hates a scammer. And yes, there are scammers. There are real issues and real conflicts to be explored in seeking to prevent the collapse of our life support systems. But they are handled so clumsily and incoherently by this film that watching it is like seeing someone start a drunken brawl over a spilled pint, then lamping his friends when they try to restrain him. It stumbles so blindly into toxic issues that Moore, former champion of the underdog, unwittingly aligns himself with white supremacists and the extreme right. Occasionally, the film lands a punch on the right nose. It is right to attack the burning of trees to make electricity. But when the film’s presenter and director, Jeff Gibbs, claims, “I found only one environmental leader willing to reject biomass and biofuels”, he can’t have been looking very far. Some people have been speaking out against them ever since they became a serious proposition (since 2004 in my case). Almost every environmental leader I know opposes the burning of fresh materials to generate power. There are also some genuine and difficult problems with renewable energy, particularly the mining of the necessary materials. But the film’s attacks on solar and wind power rely on a series of blatant falsehoods. It claims that, in producing electricity from renewables, “You use more fossil fuels to do this than you’re getting benefit from it. You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels in the first place”. This is flat wrong. On average, a solar panel generates 26 units of solar energy for every unit of fossil energy required to build and install it. For wind turbines the ratio is 44 to one. Planet of the Humans also claims that you can’t reduce fossil fuel use through renewable energy: coal is instead being replaced by gas. Well, in the third quarter of 2019, renewables in the UK generated more electricity than coal, oil and gas plants put together. As a result of the switch to renewables in this country, the amount of fossil fuel used for power generation has halved since 2010. By 2025, the government forecasts, roughly half our electricity will come from renewables, while gas burning will drop by a further 40%. To hammer home its point, the film shows footage of a “large terminal to import natural gas from the United States” that “Germany just built”. Germany has no such terminal. The footage was shot in Turkey. There is also a real story to be told about the co-option and capture of some environmental groups by the industries they should hold to account. A remarkable number of large conservation organisations take money from fossil fuel companies. This is a disgrace. But rather than pinning the blame where it lies, Planet of the Humans concentrates its attacks on Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, who takes no money from any of his campaigning work. It’s an almost comic exercise in misdirection, but unfortunately it has horrible, real-world consequences, as McKibben now faces even more threats and attacks than he confronted before. But this is by no means the worst of it. The film offers only one concrete solution to our predicament: the most toxic of all possible answers. “We really have got to start dealing with the issue of population … without seeing some sort of major die-off in population, there’s no turning back.” Yes, population growth does contribute to the pressures on the natural world. But while the global population is rising by 1% a year, consumption, until the pandemic, was rising at a steady 3%. High consumption is concentrated in countries where population growth is low. Where population growth is highest, consumption tends to be extremely low. Almost all the growth in numbers is in poor countries largely inhabited by black and brown people. When wealthy people, such as Moore and Gibbs, point to this issue without the necessary caveats, they are saying, in effect, “it’s not Us consuming, it’s Them breeding.” It’s not hard to see why the far right loves this film. Population is where you go when you haven’t thought your argument through. Population is where you go when you don’t have the guts to face the structural, systemic causes of our predicament: inequality, oligarchic power, capitalism. Population is where you go when you want to kick down. We have been here many times before. Dozens of films have spread falsehoods about environmental activists and ripped into green technologies, while letting fossil fuels off the hook. But never before have these attacks come from a famous campaigner for social justice, rubbing our faces in the dirt. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Planting almost a billion hectares of trees worldwide is the “biggest and cheapest tool” for tackling climate change, according to a new study. The researchers claimed that reforestation could remove 205 gigatonnes of carbon from the atmosphere – equivalent to about 20 years’ worth of the world’s current emissions. This has criticised as an exaggeration. It could actually be dangerous.  While the paper itself included no costings, the researchers suggested a best-case estimate of just US$300 billion to plant trees on 0.9 billion hectares. That’s just 40 US cents per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO₂) removed. More detailed studies on the costs of carbon removal through reforestation put the figure closer to US$20-50 per tonne – and even this may be optimistic at such large scales.

      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Our research suggests that the promises implied in such studies could actually set back meaningful action on climate change. This is because of what we call “mitigation deterrence” – promises of cheap and easy CO₂ removal in future make it less likely that time and money will be invested in reducing emissions now. Why would anyone expect governments or the finance sector to invest in renewable energy, or mass transit like high-speed rail, at costs of tens or hundreds of dollars a tonne if they – and shareholders and voters – are told that huge amounts of CO₂ can be absorbed from the atmosphere for a few dollars a tonne by planting trees? Why should anyone expect energy companies and airlines to reduce their emissions if they anticipate being able to pay to plant trees to offset everything they emit, for the paltry price of less than 50 cents a tonne. If studies like this suggest removing carbon is cheap and easy, the price of emitting carbon for businesses – in emissions trading schemes – will remain very low, rather than rising to the levels needed to trigger more challenging, yet urgently needed, forms of emission reduction. The promises of cheap and powerful tech fixes help to sideline thorny issues of politics, economics and culture. But when promises that look great in models and spreadsheets meet the real world, failure is often more likely. This has been seen before in the expectations around carbon capture and storage.  Despite promises of its future potential in the early 2000s, commercial development of the technology has scarcely progressed in the last decade. That’s despite many modelled pathways for limiting global warming still assuming – increasingly optimistically – that it will be deployed at a large scale in coming decades.

      George Monbiot Q + A – How rejuvenating nature could help fight climate change


 This model of tackling climate change goes hand in hand with another tool – pricing carbon emissions. This potentially allows companies to go on emitting by paying someone else to cut emissions or remove CO₂ elsewhere – an approach called climate offsetting. But offsetting makes exaggerated promises of carbon removal even more risky.  Tree planting financed through offset markets would guarantee the polluter could continue emitting carbon, but the market couldn’t guarantee removals to match those emissions. Trees might be planted and subsequently lost to wildfire or logging, or never planted at all.  Trusting in trees to remove carbon in future is particularly dangerous because trees are slow to grow and how much carbon they absorb is hard to measure. They’re also less likely to be able to do this as the climate warms. In many regions of the world but particularly in the tropics, growth rates are predicted to fall as the climate warms and devastating wildfires become more frequent. Relying on trees to absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere in the future also appears misleadingly cheap because of the effects of economic discounting. Economists discount the current value of costs or benefits more deeply, the further in the future they occur. Models which determine the cheapest mix of policies available all use some form of discounting. When researchers add carbon removal options like tree planting to these models, they tend to generate pathways for slowing temperature rise which reduce the role of short term action and replace it with imaginary removals late in the century.  This is because discounting over 30 to 60 years makes the removal options look incredibly cheap in today’s prices. Priming models to focus on minimising cost causes them to maximise the use of discounted future removals and reduce the use of more expensive near term emissions reduction.  I am not arguing against reforestation, nor for a purely technological response to climate change. Trees can help for many reasons – reducing flooding, shading and cooling communities, and providing habitat for biodiversity. Incentives for reforestation are important, and so are incentives for removing carbon. But we shouldn’t make trees or technology carry the whole burden of tackling climate change. That demands moving beyond technical questions, to deliver immediate political action to cut emissions, and to begin to transform economies and societies. This article was amended on July 13 2019 to clarify the proposed costs of carbon removal by reforestation."

The left claim that the science is settled when it comes to climate change. Well, a case can be made that the research on guns is pretty much settled too, which is why a gun register and background checks won’t work for Ardern’s government.



The changes to the Arms Act proposed by the government are essentially toughening up vetting: in other words, background checks. Background checks don’t work. The problem overseas lies in **enforcement** , which is the same problem that we already have here in New Zealand.



Basically, the police are really hopeless at enforcement.



The research clearly shows that our existing system for licensing is actually best practice, and shouldn’t be messed with.



  
“One possible explanation for why gun licensing works better than background checks: It’s a more straightforward system.  
“It’s far easier as a seller to say, ’Okay, I need to see your permit,’” Crifasi suggested. “And there’s accountability. If my gun is recovered in the hands of someone else, and I’m in a state with licensing, and that person doesn’t have a license, it’s easier to hold me accountable. I can’t say, ‘Oh, sure, I asked for a license,’ because they don’t have a license.“

Spare a thought for Prince Harry. By all accounts he is finding it difficult to get out of bed in the mornings, due to “eco‐​anxiety.” The _Sun_ reports from Botswana that he believes “everything is good in the world except for us humans.” He’s not the only one struggling. At the UN recently, Greta Thunberg was visibly shaken as she denounced the people who had stolen her dreams of a cooler world with “fairytales of eternal economic growth.”



In case it wasn’t clear before, more radical parts of the “green movement” hold a consistent preconception: that human beings and our innate desire for betterment are _the problem_ where environmental issues are concerned. We are destroying the planet, devouring its finite resources through selfish fertility and consumption decisions, while pumping greenhouse gases into its atmosphere. “A plague on the earth,” is how David Attenborough once kindly described us.



The high priest of this worldview was Paul Ehrlich, who coined the oft‐​repeated assertion that “you can’t go on growing forever on a finite planet.” Prince Charles agrees. Earth simply can’t sustain us if more and more people aspire to Western consumption levels, he says. To save the planet therefore requires curbing population growth, rowing back substantially on consumption (so‐​called degrowth), or both. Little surprise then that contemporary climate change “solutions” from radical environmentalists include economically destructive, rapid carbon mitigation (“Bring on the recession!” as George Monbiot once said) or curbing global population growth.



Yet there’s a big problem here: Ehrlich and Prince Charles’ analysis was and is wrong. Population growth doesn’t “use up” the earth’s finite resources and economic growth possibilities are not finite. That’s because technologies and human ideas are not fixed. Resource constraint worriers ignore that humans adapt, dream up efficiencies, and change behaviours. As countries become much richer, they become better placed, and more willing to, care for the environment. Even on climate change, a classic “externality” problem, it is the same innovative spirit that drives economic progress that will deliver any transition or adaptation to a lower carbon economy and warmer world.



Consider the evidence. If growth in population or consumption were simply about running down scarce resources, we’d expect commodity prices to continuously rise with population or economic growth. Yet from 1980 to 2017, when the world’s population shot up by nearly 70 per cent, prices of a basket of 50 important commodities actually fell by an average of 36 per cent (or 65 per cent, if instead you consider the reduction in time an average human had to work to purchase them).



Population and consumption growth might put pressure on resource availability for any given level of technology or set of demands. But human innovation means, over time, we devise _better_ ideas and forms of technology to access or convert those resources, or shift to other alternatives when prices rise. In the race between the human brain and resource scarcity, we are winning. As my colleague Marian Tupy has said: “the Earth’s atoms may be fixed, but the possible combinations of those atoms are infinite.”



As counterintuitive as it sounds, that same innovation means economic growth doesn’t necessitate more and more resource use either. Greens think of growth as about consuming “stuff.” And for good reason: during and after the industrial revolution, GDP growth really did go hand in hand with energy use growth. But in a service and high productivity world, production and value clearly arises from doing more with less too. The iPhone in your pocket has replaced a clock, diaries, calendars, letters, calculators, photo albums, large telephones, trips to the bank, compasses, a contact book, and much else. Think of all the resources saved! No wonder Ronald Reagan once said “there are no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits to the human capacity for intelligence, imagination and wonder.”



Again, the distinction between a static and dynamic world is crucial when considering the environmental impact of this. As Tim Harford explains, if we were all suddenly a fair bit poorer, we’d probably substitute a hat and coat for heating in our homes. But this doesn’t mean that if our incomes trebled over the next five decades, we’d crank up the heating and boil ourselves in our homes. In fact, as we’ve got richer over the last quarter of a century, total energy use per person has actually been falling in countries such as the US and UK, even beyond that accounted for by offshoring of manufacturing.



This is one good example of how economic growth helps shift us up the hierarchy of needs. As advanced countries have solved problems of food, warmth, and shelter, people can afford to worry more about the natural world around them more broadly too. Recent global growth has gone hand‐​in‐​hand with the forested area of the planet increasing since 1982 and a continuous fall in fertility, in part because wealthier people want to invest more in the “quality” of their children.



In this light, Prince Harry and Greta’s eco‐​anxiety is a clear sign of privilege. Neither is having to scramble to illegally chop trees for money to survive, overhunt wild animals as a source of a nutritious diet, or spend half their adult lives pregnant to ensure at least a couple of their kids survive. Many around the world aren’t so lucky, or comfortable enough to put the environment first. A UN poll of 10 million people around the globe showed far more worry about their educational opportunities or whether their kids are starving or dying from disease.



Once you understand this: what growth is, how it is driven by human innovation, and what consequences it has, you see how futile and damaging an “anti‐​human” approach to global climate change would be. Drastic mitigation would condemn much of humanity to poorer lives, making us worse environmental stewards in other regards and facing much worse consequences of any warming that occurs. Authoritarian population controls would backfire too, reducing the potential market and payoffs for innovators developing climate change remedies in everything from electric cars to solar panels.



No, the only sustainable, credible route to reducing carbon emissions and adapting to warming will come precisely from the sorts of innovation driving the “fairytales” Thunberg bemoans. Acknowledging this does not preclude modest, economically reasonable policies, such as R&D investments, or even a degree of carbon pricing, to speed up and incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship on low carbon climate solutions. What it does rule out is drastically rowing back on our activities, freedoms, or desires for children.



If Prince Harry is to regain his morning sprightliness, he’ll have to find more faith in economic growth and innovation to the challenges that face us. Human ingenuity, far from being a burden, is the world’s most important resource.

"**There are no plans to introduce a ""vaccine passport"" to give people access to places such as pubs and restaurants once a coronavirus jab becomes available, says Michael Gove.**
The Cabinet Office minister told the BBC: ""That's not the plan.""
His comments come after the vaccine minister suggested businesses could bar those who have not had a jab.
The vaccine rollout in the UK is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval.
Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the vaccine in England.
Asked on Monday whether people who get the Covid-19 jab will receive some kind of ""immunity passport"" to show they have been vaccinated, Mr Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology.
""And, of course, a way of people being able to inform their GP that they have been vaccinated.
""But, also, I think you'll probably find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system - as they have done with the (test and trace) app.
""I think that in many ways, the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers who'll say, 'Look, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated'.
""But, also, we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible.""
However, asked about the possibility of vaccine passports, Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves, that's not the plan.""
""What we want to do is to make sure that we can get vaccines effectively rolled out.""
He added that individual businesses would ""of course"" have the ""capacity to make decisions about who they will admit and why"".
""But the most important thing that we should be doing at this stage is concentrating on making sure the vaccine is rolled out.""
If a Covid vaccine becomes available, the NHS will keep a log of who has received it. That will be to make sure people are given the right number of doses and to allow any monitoring and follow-up.
But asking individuals to carry proof of vaccination would be for a different reason - to cut the risk of transmitting Covid to others.
Some countries already require immunisation certificates for diseases such as polio or yellow fever to prevent global spread.
The difficulty with proposing the same for Covid-19 is we don't yet know if immunisation stops someone being contagious.
The vaccine trials so far show that jabs are very good at preventing illness, but more studies are needed to determine if they will also prevent a person from ""shedding and spreading"" the virus.
That's why it's premature to talk about vaccine passports to give people access to pubs and clubs, let alone other countries.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press conference on Monday: ""For a long time now we've been looking at the questions that minister Zahawi was talking about and the question of what's the impact on the individual in terms of what they can do.""
But he added that the government did ""not plan to mandate the vaccine"".
Many businesses have previously touted the idea of so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a hospitality venue by showing proof that they were not infectious.
The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said that the idea of storing vaccination records in the NHS Test and Trace app is controversial with privacy experts warning that using the app to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory.
He adds: ""Complex decisions would be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus."""
"As if there was any doubt, the UN’s latest report on climate change makes clear this is one of the most pressing issues of our times. And as we witness Extinction Rebellion stirring the pot of protest in the UK, that movement is connected to the geopolitical experience of other countries in important ways. This is certainly the case where Mexico is concerned, a country that has been rightly held up as a major leader on climate change in the developing world, while putting the US government to shame over its own inaction. The Paris Agreement is a crucial UN-led international arrangement that intensifies global climate decarbonisation and adaptation measures, yet the Trump administration has indicated its intention to pull out. Mexico has taken direct inspiration from the UK’s Climate Change Act, which requires a 34% reduction in national greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (measured at 1990 emissions levels). In early June the UK government pledged a new commitment of “net zero” by 2050. Seeking to follow the UK, Mexico put its own equivalent General Law on Climate Change in place in 2012 with advice and support from British experts. The UK is now recognised as the pioneer of this type of framework approach to climate change in the developed world, with Mexico as the equivalent torchbearer in the developing world. But things are running far from smoothly in Mexico at present. The country’s recent election of “strongman” president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has significantly hampered the General Law’s implementation. Since taking office in December 2018, the leftist populist has swung his attention and sympathies towards Mexico’s powerful fossil fuel lobby, supported in turn by other powerful lobbies including cement and steel. Planning to restore the national oil company Pemex to its glory days after the previous administration opened it up to the private sector, Obrador said recently: “We are going to rescue this industry that is so important for the country’s development.” As one of the country’s biggest employers, this has gone down well with many Mexicans. But this also means the future stability of Mexico’s celebrated low-carbon transition has been cast into serious doubt. Admittedly, the General Law was rocked and buffeted by heavy political winds since its first inception under the presidency of Felipe Calderón. Calderón’s six-year term, which ended in November 2012, was far from smooth, given the damaging impact of economic recession and disquiet around his alleged suppression of the press. But the Calderón administration did succeed in elevating climate change to a position of serious importance on the Mexican policy agenda, bolstered by substantial support from the UK. Just as the General Law was bedding in, Calderón was replaced by President Enrique Peña Nieto. Beset by accusations of corruption, Nieto’s administration displayed scant regard for climate concerns, and was able to leverage one of the General Law’s great deficiencies to create a culture of climate inertia – a gaping chasm between the law itself and its implementation. In other words, the law was prescribed but the specific policies needed to achieve lower carbon emissions were not.  Enter the recently elected President Obrador, who is presently extending this troubling gap between law and action. The Mexican government has long had an I-say-you-do tendency that emanates from the presidential office downward – a tradition strengthened by this recent election. Mexican presidential administrations run for six-year terms (they are non-renewable), and the current president is only getting warmed up. Of course, in terms of broader UK/Mexico dynamics, things are far from perfect on the UK side. For starters, the UK government has now agreed to up its 2050 reduction target for emissions to net zero, but this could prove difficult to achieve in practice, and some pressure groups including Extinction Rebellion are pushing for a net zero economy by 2025. Admittedly, Mexico’s General Law lacks stringent UK-style reduction targets altogether, instead rolling some soft aspirational targets into an annex to the legal text. But Mexico is a poorer developing country that is not historically responsible for emissions release to the same extent that the highly industrialised developed world is. And so, in spite of some flaws, the Mexican scheme does set a positive example to the wider world. A growing number of countries are taking inspiration from the serious commitment Mexico and the UK have made to climate issues by scrambling to put their own version of these climate change acts in place. Added to this, a few months before Obrador took office, in July 2018, an amendment beefed up the Mexican framework slightly to bring it into line with requirements under the international Paris Agreement. So there is still much to feel optimistic about. It is to be hoped that the Obrador administration recognises that valuing and acting on Mexico’s important, pioneering framework begins at home. This will allow the flow of international green finance to Mexico from the UK and other major state funders to continue. If not, the UK will be looking elsewhere for a developing nation to support it in its commitment to fighting climate change."
"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

"When we agree to send our young men and women to war, we expect the reasons why to be made clear. At least some of us will want to subject that explanation to scrutiny at the time, and often even more so with hindsight. That’s why having access to historical documents is an important democratic right. The US sent hundreds of thousands of troops into the disastrous eight-year war in Iraq, propelled by Iraq’s supposed breaches of agreements under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and guided by rules negotiated at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  The IAEA, founded in 1957, was set up to champion the peaceful use of nuclear science (“atoms for peace”). The NPT, established in 1968, was intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the nuclear states of the US, USSR, UK, France and China by regulating the movement of uranium and other nuclear material and equipment across national borders. Not only has it failed to do so – Israel, India and Pakistan have acquired nuclear weapons since – but in Iraq we had an example of IAEA rules, and the inspectors that ensure they are followed, being used to justify conventional wars. While this was evident in Iraq, the same game of nuclear brinkmanship is being played out now through negotiations dragged out over several decades between the political leadership of Iran and the IAEA’s various member nations. Yet, for all the IAEA’s demands of openness, peering into the organisation’s workings and history is like trying to prise open an impossibly stubborn black box. Why is it so difficult for researchers to obtain useful documentation from the IAEA archives? Perhaps there are reasons to remain opaque about ongoing discussions.  However, if our elected officials are pushing Iran (or any country) on their nuclear programs, it is our responsibility to take a hard look at the history of the negotiations. That means reading through the detailed discussions at the IAEA, not just about Iran or Iraq, but about the whole nuclear industry. What technologies were originally considered dangerous, when the first nations signed on to the NPT? What attitudes about national sovereignty and commercial development prevailed then? What concerns about an imperial, European- and US-dominated nuclear world were vented in these early discussions? This history is key to making informed contemporary decisions about fairness, good faith, promises made, and promises kept. Fortunately some of this documentation is available, scattered in national archives and private collections throughout the world. But you won’t find it at the IAEA in Vienna. At a recent academic conference on the origins of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a fellow panelist surprised me by noting how frustrated she’d felt in reading my pre-circulated paper. I braced for a withering critique but instead was complimented on how, while she’d searched in vain at the IAEA archives for even basic negotiating documents on nuclear safeguards, my paper cited meetings of the IAEA Board of Governors. I had found them in the UK National Archives, as at IAEA they are still under wraps. I have spent many years triangulating Cold War stories between the archives of governments, international agencies, personal papers, and independent bodies. Sometimes what is considered sensitive in one country can be found in perfectly open, long-declassified documents in another. Why does the IAEA continue to guard secrets from decades past? The IAEA claims it is obliged to withhold documents until all of the countries mentioned in them agree to declassification. In practice, this guarantees permanent secrecy. I understood my colleague’s frustration, as I have also met a blank wall working in the IAEA archives. Years ago I discovered a trove of documents about Ronald Silow, a scientist who had, after working at a joint FAO-IAEA unit on agricultural applications of atomic energy, penned memos denouncing what he saw as the agency’s unethical behaviour.  I found the documents in Rome, at the archives of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. But when I looked into Silow’s story in the official history of the IAEA, I found only obscure references to him, his name unmentioned. When I searched the IAEA archives, the trail led nowhere: no documents related to his case were available. One document listing employees simply showed his name, crossed out. The IAEA is different from other agencies in the United Nations system. Unlike the agencies devoted to food and agriculture, global health, or to science, education, and culture, the IAEA’s remit is to promote a single set of technologies – but its remit also hands it the position of both chief salesman and chief arbiter of controversies about peaceful and military uses. It is a hammer in search of nails, but is uncomfortable with historical facts about the quality of its workmanship. The agency has a long way to go to demonstrate it understands the need for transparency. The standards it has set since the 1960s are at the cornerstone of today’s major controversies, leading to years of deadly war and leaving countries riven by internal strife. Differences of interpretation of them make the positions of the US and Iran appear irreconcilable. We are in the ridiculous position of asking experts at the IAEA for guidance that may or may not lead to more young men and women being placed in harm’s way, simply to prevent dangerous material from falling in the wrong hands. The IAEA owes us access to its history."

This year Auckland Transport says it will build over 9K of cycleways in Auckland. But that’s not good enough for Simon Wilson who whines about it in a newspaper.



Auckland Transport has “courageously” adopted the Vision Zero road safety plan, targeting 65 per cent reduction in deaths and serious injuries by 2030 and zero by 2050. But why is there no extra money for cycleways?  
  
Unusual scenes in the Auckland Transport boardroom this week. It was quite full, with the board members around one end of the large table, executives around the other, and a large group of staff, from AT, and the council and the police, sitting behind them.  
  
Andrew Bell, “implementation manager for safe systems” at AT, the team leader for most of those staffers, made a speech.   
  
“Tihei mauri ora,” he began, before going on to praise the board for adopting “more than just a document”. He was talking about the Vision Zero Strategy & Action Plan, a major, multi-agency initiative to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries (DSIs) on our roads.  
  
The targets are very bold: to reduce the current historic highs by 20 per cent by 2021, 65 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050. From more than 700 DSIs a year to 250 in 10 years, and to zero in 30 years.  
  
[…]Bell talked a little about the work his team had done. “We’ve talked to people who’ve lost loved ones,” he said. “We have a lot of hope. This plan requires leadership and courage. Thank you.” And they all got up and sang “Tatira mai nga iwi”.



You couldn’t make this up. Can you imagine the board of a major company getting up and all singing Kumbaya My Lord?



[…]Acting chair Wayne Donnelly beamed with pride. He said he’d been involved in safety for a long time. “Finally, we’re moving away from being a car-dominated city,” he said. “Safety is about people in vehicles and outside them.” That’s certainly true: 47 per cent of the sharp rise in DSIs in the past five years has involved people not in a vehicle.  




Translation: AT wants Aucklanders to stop driving cars.



[…]They’re excited. Sherritt told me the day before about the $700 million AT has committed to the project over the current 10-year period. Last year, $45m was allocated to safety. This year it’s $75m. Next year it will be $104m.  
  
While high-risk intersections are targeted, so are dangerous rural roads. Speeds will be lowered, although the board has extended to October 31 the deadline for the final proposals on exactly where and by how much.  
  
Already, though, lower speeds are being trialled in Te Atat&umacr and Papakura. There’s been a bit of blowback: some trucks make a lot of noise going over the raised tables at pedestrian crossings, and there are drivers who don’t believe they should have to slow down as much as the tables force them too.



Raised tables at pedestrian crossings also slow down emergency vehicles like ambulances. In other words they prevent lives from being saved.



[…]It’s all good stuff. Or is it? I asked the AT boss, Shane Ellison, what this would mean for bike lanes. He thought about it.  
  
“This doesn’t of itself trigger greater investment,” he said.  
  
What? Why not?  
  
[…]All those extra dollars and no more funding for cycleways? Nothing added to the work plan? Are you kidding?  
  
[…]Ellison said, “We’ve done better than we thought we would this year, too. We thought we’d do 7.65, I think it is, but it’s going to be 9.65. We’re overperforming.”  
  
Those numbers are kilometres. Auckland Transport is “overperforming” in its delivery of cycle lanes by adding less than 10 kilometres a year to the network.  
  
[…]The problem is fear, of angering motorists and their cheerleaders. They really need to get over that.



The fear is losing their jobs for not doing their job, ie improving transport for everyone including people who drive cars.



[…]In the AT strategy to mode-shift people away from single-occupancy vehicles, cycling is supposed to be important. Cycling helps with congestion, public health, community building and, for heaven’s sake, climate change.  
  
But in the budget and plans to support AT’s bold new focus on safety, it’s been forgotten. This is the city that once had the courage to build the pink pathway: Te Ara I Whiti. Where’s that courage now?



So there you have it. AT wants to “mode-shift” people out of cars. And in the name of safety too.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPowerful autumn storm St. Jude (dubbed Christian in Germany) swept across England and the North Sea Sunday and Monday, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Especially hard hit were England, Northern France, Holland and the North German coast.
The storm claimed 14 lives in Europe.
Particularly hard hit was the north German port city of Hamburg, which saw wind gusts of up to 120 km/hr. That in itself is not an unusual event for the city, as North Sea storms of this magnitude occur about every 5 or 10 years. What was unusual and devastating, however, was how the city waited until the storm was raging over the city at peak fury before issuing any storm warning at all. Hamburg is governed by a coalition of socialists and environmental greens.
Meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetternet.de here writes that even though Storm Christian had been forecast for days, Hamburg city officials remained deeply asleep and did not wake up to issue any storm warning until 2:26 pm Monday afternoon. By that time the storm was already raging at its peak and the city had plunged into chaos. See wind speed chart below.

Wind speed measured at a weather station near Hamburg. Green curve – wind gusts. Blue curve – wind speed. Source: wetter24.de/html
How Hamburg officials failed to issue a storm warning is a mystery and shows that the city’s early warning system was nothing less than a debacle.
It’s not like the storm came without ample warning. A day earlier England was being battered by the storm. Hours before hitting Germany, western neighbor Holland had seen record wind speeds and France had saw widespread power outages. Jung at wetternet.de writes:
In England it was the most powerful storm in over 10 years. At the coast of Holland it was even the most violent hurricane ever observed in an October month. On the Dutch islands wind gusts of 152 km/hr were recorded. In France more than 75,000 homes lost power.”

Moreover, wetternet.de had already warned of a developing storm last week on Wednesday, read here.
Now a day later, some German meteorologists are scratching their heads over the inaction and are lashing out at the ineptitude of Hamburg officials. Jung writes that the inaction was “amazing and unacceptable“:
It wasn’t until 2:26 pm that a storm warning was issued for the Hansa City (Hamburg). At that point the storm was already going at full blast. At 2:25 pm the fire department had already declared a state of emergency.
The storm could be seen coming already days earlier. At the latest on Monday morning, when the damage and wind speeds in England and France were already known, should a storm warning have been issued in order to warn the public, police, fire and rescue services. Why a storm warning was issued only when Hamburg found itself in the middle of chaos is completely incomprehensible. […] Even stranger: The storm warning issued at 2:26 was for the time period of 3:30 pm to 8 p.m.”
According to Jung at wetternet.de, the storm produced wind gusts of close to 200 km/hr. at the North Sea islands. At Helgoland gusts of 190 km/h were measured – a record value for the island!
Yesterday afternoon as I was driving I noticed toppled trees, small branches littering the streets everywhere, and truckers struggling to keep their rigs under control. I remember thinking it was quite a fall storm, and wondered why the media was being low key about it. Now I know the answer: incompetent officials!
Ironically, these socialist and green party officials are the very ones who like to go on TV and tell viewers how terrible it is when cities like New Orleans and New York are hit by hurricanes and how US officials are too incompetent to cope with storms.
Well, after witnessing Hamburg yesterday, US officials who handled Sandy look like first class experts by comparison.
Expect the hapless Hamburg officials to react by blaming “climate change” for the storm’s “unexpected intensity”.

 **Introduction**



It is galling to hear administration officials characterize the auto bailouts as “successful.” The word should be off‐​limits when describing this unfortunate chapter in U.S. economic history. At most, bailout proponents and apologists might respectfully argue — and still be wrong, however — that the bailouts were necessary evils undertaken to avert greater calamity.



But calling the bailouts “successful” is to whitewash the diversion of funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program by two administrations for purposes unauthorized by Congress; the looting and redistribution of claims against GM’s and Chrysler’s assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners; the use of questionable tactics to bully stakeholders into accepting terms to facilitate politically desirable outcomes; the unprecedented encroachment by the executive branch into the finest details of the bankruptcy process to orchestrate what bankruptcy law experts describe as “Sham” sales of Old Chrysler to New Chrysler and Old GM to New GM; the costs of denying Ford and the other more deserving automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the United Autoworkers, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against similar market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about the direction of policy under the current administration that pervades the business environment to this very day.



In addition to the above, there is the fact that taxpayers are still short tens of billions of dollars on account of the GM bailout without serious prospects for ever being made whole. Thus, acceptance of the administration’s pronouncement of auto bailout success demands profound gullibility or willful ignorance. Sure, GM has experienced recent profits and Chrysler has repaid much of its debt to the Treasury. But if proper judgment is to be passed, then all of the bailout’s costs and benefits must be considered. Otherwise, calling the bailout a success is like applauding the recovery of a drunken driver after an accident, while ignoring the condition of the family he severely maimed.



This testimony provides a more comprehensive assessment of the costs and lasting implications of the GM bailout than the administration has been willing to undertake publicly.



 **Crisis Mongering**



On November 5, 2008, the Center for Automotive Research, a Detroit‐​based consulting firm, released the results of a study warning that as many as three million jobs were at stake in the automotive sector unless the U.S. government acted with dispatch to ensure the continued operation of all of the Big Three automakers.1 Detroit’s media blitz was underway. It was timed to remind then‐​President‐​Elect Obama, as he contemplated his victory the morning after, of the contribution to his success by certain constituencies now seeking assistance themselves. The CAR report’s projection of three million lost jobs was predicated on the fantastical worst‐​case scenario that if one of the Big Three were to go out of business and liquidate, numerous firms in the auto supply chain would go under as well, bringing down the remaining two Detroit auto producers, then the foreign nameplate U.S. producers and the rest of the parts supply chain. The job loss projections animating the national discussion were based on an assumption of a total loss of all automobile and auto parts production and sales jobs nationwide. Importantly, the report gave no consideration to the more realistic scenario that one or two of the Detroit automakers might seek Chapter 11 protection to reorganize.



The subsequent public relations effort to make the case for federal assistance was pitched in a crisis atmosphere with an air of certainty that the only real alternative to massive federal assistance was liquidation and contagion. The crisis‐​mongering was reminiscent of former‐​Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s insistence six weeks earlier that there was no time for Congress to think, only time for it to act on a financial sector bailout (i.e., TARP), lest the economy face financial ruin.



About the economic situation at that time, incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste … [t]his crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.“2



The mainstream media obliged the script, elevating the automobile industry “crisis” to the top of the news cycle for the next month, and helping to characterize the debate in the simplistic, polarizing dichotomy of “Main Street versus Wall Street.” The notion that some financial institutions took risks, lost big, and were rescued by Washington became the prevailing argument for bailing out the auto companies, and the specific facts about viability and worthiness were all but totally ignored.



But public opinion quickly changed when the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Chrysler laid waste to months of public relations planning and millions of dollars spent trying to cultivate a winning message when they each arrived in Washington, tin cups in hand, aboard their own corporate jets. That fateful episode turned the media against Detroit and reminded Americans — or at least opened their minds to the prospect — that the automakers were in dire straits because of bad decisions made in the past and helped convince many that a shake out, instead of a bailout, was the proper course of action.



A few weeks later, on the same day that the CEOs returned to Washington, attempting to show contrition by making the trip from Detroit in their companies’ most eco‐​friendly cars, a new automobile assembly plant opened for business in Greensburg, Indiana. Although the hearing on Capitol Hill received far more media coverage, the unveiling of Honda’s newest facility in the American heartland spoke volumes about the true state of the U.S. car industry — and provided another example of why the bailout was misguided. The U.S. auto industry was not at risk. Two companies were suffering the consequences of years of incompetence and inefficiency exacerbated by persistent overcapacity and a deep recession. Normal bankruptcies for the two automakers were viable options, but certain stakeholders didn’t like their prospects under those circumstances.



Today, when President Obama contends that his administration saved the auto industry, he evokes memories of those CAR projections of 2–3 million job losses in the absence of government intervention. Without those inflated figures concocted during a time of “crisis,” the 225,000 jobs lost in the auto sector since November 2008 seem quite mild — even worthy of praise.3



 **That Which is Seen**



While bailout enthusiasts hail GM’s first‐​quarter earnings as proof that the administration saved the auto industry, President Obama should know better than to gloat. No such feat was accomplished and the imperative of extricating the government from GM’s operations has yet to be achieved.



With profits of $3.2 billion, the first quarter of 2011 was GM’s best performance in ten years and its fifth‐​consecutive profitable quarter. That’s good for GM, and predictably those earnings have been hailed by some as a validation of government intervention. _The Washington Post_ ’s E.J. Dionne asserted: “Far too little attention has been paid to the success of the government’s rescue of the Detroit‐​based auto companies, and almost no attention has been paid to how completely and utterly wrong opponents of the bailout were when they insisted it was doomed to failure.”



Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm tweeted: “To all of you in the strangle‐​government crowd, who said the bailout would never work — I’m just sayin.”



Dionne and Granholm have created a straw man, contending that bailout critics thought that the government couldn’t resuscitate GM. But the most thoughtful criticism of the bailout was not predicated on the notion that GM couldn’t be saved by the government marshaling the vast resources at its disposal. That opposition was borne of concern that that the government would do just that, and in the process impose many more costs and inflict greater damage. And that’s what it did.



But Dionne and Granholm, like others before them, stand slack‐​jawed, in awe, ready and willing to buy the Brooklyn Bridge, donning blinders and viewing just a narrow sliver of the world, oblivious to the fact that related events have been transpiring in the other 359 degrees that surround him. They are the perfect Bastiat foils, incapable of discerning the costs that are not immediately apparent.4



But only the most gullible observers would accept GM’s profits as an appropriate measure of the wisdom of the auto bailout. Those profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed over $50 billion to the task of rescuing a single company. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten, and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a cyclical U.S. recovery and structural global expansion in auto demand — only the most incompetent operation could fail to make big profits. To that point, it’s worth noting that more than half of GM’s reported profit — $1.8 billion of $3.2 billion — is attributable to the one‐​time sales of shares in Ally Financial and Delphi, which says nothing about whether GM can make and sell automobiles profitably going forward.



In the process of “rescuing” GM, the government opened a Pandora’s Box. Any legitimate verdict on the efficacy of the intervention must account for the costs of mitigating the problems that escaped the box.



 **That Which is Not Seen**



 _Spoils of Competition Denied — Market Process Short‐​Circuited_



The intervention on GM’s behalf denied the spoils of competition — the market share, sales revenues, profits, and productive assets — to Ford, Honda, Hyundai, and all of the other automakers that made better products, made better operational decisions, were more efficient, or were more responsive to consumer demands than GM, thereby short‐​circuiting a feedback loop that is essential to the healthy functioning of competitive market economies.



Corporate bailouts are clearly unfair to taxpayers, but they are also unfair to the successful firms in the industry, who are implicitly taxed and burdened when their competition is subsidized. In a properly functioning market economy, the better firms — the ones that are more innovative, more efficient, and more popular among consumers — gain market share or increase profits, while the lesser firms contract. This process ensures that limited resources are used most productively.



It has been suggested that I view GM’s fate as a matter of national indifference. That’s correct, because I have not made the mistake of conflating GM’s condition with that of the U.S. auto industry. Whether or not there are so‐​called “national interests” in ensuring the existence of a healthy domestic auto industry (and I’m not convinced there are), health comes through an evolutionary process in which the companies that have made the right decisions survive and grow, and those that have made bad decisions contract and sometimes even disappear.



It is not only fair, but efficient and wise that the market rewards companies that make better products at better prices with higher profits and larger market shares, while the companies that make undesirable products at high cost lose profits and market share.



There is still enormous overcapacity in the U.S. auto industry, reconciliation of which the bailout of GM (and Chrsyler) has deferred at great cost to the other firms and their workers.



 _Weakening of the Rule of Law_



Although legislation to provide funding for an auto bailout passed in the House of Representatives in December 2008, the bill did not garner enough support in the Senate, where it died. Prospects for any form of taxpayer bailout seemed remote and the proper course of action for GM and Chrysler, reorganization under Chapter 11, appeared imminent. An interventionist bullet, seemingly, had been dodged.



But then, just days after then‐​Secretary Paulson claimed to have no authority to use TARP funds to support the auto companies, President Bush announced that he would authorize bridge loans from the TARP of $17.4 billion to GM and Chrysler. That opened the door to further mischief and, ultimately, another $60 billion was diverted from TARP by the Obama administration for unauthorized purposes related to the auto bailout.



Likewise, the Obama administration treated the GM (and Chrysler) bankruptcy as a Section 363 sale, which are known among bankruptcy lawyers as “Sham” sales. These 363 sales are intended to sell assets out of bankruptcy from one company to another, but are not intended as vehicles to facilitate entire corporate restructurings. In a reorganization process, all creditors are given the right to vote on the proposed plan, as well as the opportunity to offer competing reorganization plans. A 363 asset sale has no such requirements, and is being used increasingly by companies seeking to avert paying legitimate claims to creditors.



That the U.S. executive branch would pretend that the restructuring of GM was nothing more than an asset sale and deny creditors the right to vote or to offer competing bids wreaks of crony capitalism.



Though it is a difficult cost to quantify, executive branch overreach — to put it mildly — is a threat to the U.S. system of checks and balances and an affront to the rule of law.



 _Executive Encroachment into Bankruptcy Process_



General Motors was a perfectly viable company that could have been restructured through normal bankruptcy proceedings. The big question was whether GM could have received financing to operate during bankrupt, given the problems in credit markets in 2008 and 2009. Instead of commandeering the bankruptcy process as a condition of providing debtor in possession financing, the Obama administration could have provided the funds and allowed an apolitical, independent bankruptcy process to take place. But the administration’s rationale for a hand‐​on approach was that it wanted to ensure that taxpayers weren’t just throwing good money after bad, chasing empty promises made by executives with credibility problems. Yet, even with the administration’s plans for GM’s post‐​bankruptcy ownership thrust upon the company without allowance for consideration of competing plans, taxpayers will lose between $10–20 billion (without considering the $12 to $14 billion costs of the unorthodox tax breaks granted GM by the administration).



The administration’s willingness to insulate important political allies, like the UAW, from the consequences of their decisions, to shift possession of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners, and to deny “deficiency” claims to creditors who were short‐​changed, will make it more difficult for companies in politically important industries to borrow from private sources when they are in trouble, thereby increasing their reliance on the government purse.



The government’s willingness to intervene in the auto market under false pretenses to pick winners and losers is a significant cause of the regime uncertainty that has pervaded the U.S. economy, deterred business investment and job creation, and slowed the economic recovery ever since.



 **Outstanding Financial Costs**



As Washington has been embroiled in a discussion about national finances that features figures in the trillions of dollars, one might be tempted to marginalize as paltry the sum still owed taxpayers from the GM bailout. That figure is estimated to be about $27 billion, which accounts for the $50 billion outlay minus approximately $23 billion raised at GM’s IPO last November. But that is a very conservative figure considering that it excludes: $12-$14 billion in unorthodox tax breaks granted to GM in bankruptucy; $17 billion in funds committed from the TARP to GM’s former financial arm GMAC (which was supported to facilitate GM sales); GM’s portion of the $25 billion Energy Department slush fund to underwrite research and development in green auto technology; and the $7,500 tax credit granted for every new purchase of a Chevy Volt. There may be other subsidies, as well.



With respect to GM, taxpayers are on the line for much more than is commonly discussed.



The administration wants to put maximum distance between the episode of GM’s nationalization and the 2012 campaign season, which is nearly upon us. In that regard, the administration would like to sell the Treasury’s remaining 500 million shares as soon as possible. But the administration would also like to “make the taxpayers whole.” The problem for the president on that score is that the stock price — even with all of the happy news about the auto industry turnaround — isn’t cooperating. As of this morning, GM stock is hovering just under $30 per share. If all of the 500 million remaining publicly‐​owned shares could be sold at that price, the Treasury would net $15 billion. Add that to the $23 billion raised from the initial public offering last November, and the “direct” public loss on GM is about $12 billion — calculated as a $50 billion outlay minus a $38 billion return. (And not considering all of the extra costs identified above.)



To net $50 billion, those 500 million public shares must be sold at an average price of just over $53 — a virtual impossibility anytime soon. Why? The most significant factor suppressing the stock value is the market’s knowledge that the largest single holder of GM stock wants to unload about 500 million shares in the short term. That fact will continue to trump any positive news about GM and its profit potential, not that such news should be expected.



Projections about gasoline prices vary, but as long as prices at the pump remain in the $4 range, GM is going to suffer. Among major automakers, GM is most exposed to the downside of high gasoline prices. Despite all of the subsidies and all of the hoopla over the Chevy Volt (only 1,700 units have been sold through April 2011) and the Chevy Cruse (now subject to a steering column recall that won’t help repair negative quality perceptions), GM does not have much of a competitive presence in the small car market. Though GM held the largest overall U.S. market share in 2010, it had the smallest share (8.4%) of the small car market, which is where the demand will be if high gas prices persist. GM will certainly have to do better in that segment once the federally mandated average fleet fuel efficiency standard rises to 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016.



Reaping what it sowed, the administration finds itself in an unenviable position. It can entirely divest of GM in the short term at what would likely be a $10-to-$20 billion taxpayer loss (the stock price will drop if 500 million shares are put up for sale in short period) and face the ire of an increasingly cost‐ and budget‐​conscious electorate. Or the administration can hold onto the stock, hoping against hope that GM experiences economic fortunes good enough to more than compensate for the stock price‐​suppressing effect of the market’s knowledge of an imminent massive sales, while contending with accusations of market meddling and industrial policy.



The longer the administration retains shares in GM, it will be tempted to meddle to achieve politically desirable results.



 **Redefining Success**



Or, the administration can do what it is going to do: first, lower expectations that the taxpayer will ever recover $50 billion. Here’s a recent statement by Tim Geithner: “We’re going to lose money in the auto industry … We didn’t do these things to maximize return. We did them to save jobs. The biggest impact of these programs was in the millions of jobs saved.” That’s a safe counterfactual, since it can never be tested or proved. (There are 225,000 fewer jobs in the auto industry as of April 2011 than there were in November 2008, when the bailout process began.)



Second, the administration will argue that the Obama administration is only on the hook for $40 billion (the first $10 billion having coming from Bush). In a post‐​IPO, November 2010 statement revealing of a man less concerned with nation’s finances than his own political prospects, President Obama asserted: “American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than _my administration_ invested in GM, and that’s a good thing.” (My emphasis).



 **Lasting Implications**



The lasting implications of the bailout will depend on whether or not Americans ultimately accept the narrative that the bailout was a success. If it is considered a success, the threshold for interventions will have been lowered and Americans will have the opportunity to judge similar bailouts in the future. If it is considered a failure — as it should be — the lasting implications will be less destructive because the threshold that tempts interventionists will be higher. On that score, contrary to what the administration would have the public believe, gauging the “success” of the GM bailout requires consideration of more than just the ratio of finances recouped over financial outlays.



There are numerous other costs that don’t factor into that equation.



If the bailout is considered a success, some of the likely lasting implications will include the following:



 **Conclusion**



The objection to the auto bailout was not that the federal government wouldn’t be able to marshal adequate resources to help GM. The most serious concerns were about the consequences of that intervention — the undermining of the rule of law, the property confiscations, the politically driven decisions and the distortion of market signals.



Any verdict on the auto bailouts must take into account, among other things, the illegal diversion of TARP funds, the forced transfer of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners and their union; the higher‐​risk premiums consequently built into U.S. corporate debt; the costs of denying Ford and the other more worthy automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the autoworkers’ union, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about policy that pervades the business environment to this day.



GM’s recent profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed more than $50 billion to the task of rescuing those companies and the United Auto Workers. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a recovery in U.S. auto demand — only the most incompetent operations could fail to make profits.



But taxpayers are still short at least $10 billion to $20 billion (depending on the price that the government’s 500 million shares of GM will fetch), and there is still significant overcapacity in the auto industry.



The administration should divest as soon as possible, without regard to the stock price. Keeping the government’s tentacles around a large firm in an important industry will keep the door open wider to industrial policy and will deter market‐​driven decision‐​making throughout the industry, possibly keeping the brakes on the recovery. Yes, there will be a significant loss to taxpayers. But the right lesson to learn from this chapter in history is that government interventions carry real economic costs — only some of which are readily measurable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is more reaction to AR5 SPM – from two German experts.
First I asked geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning by e-mail for his impression of the IPCC’s summary. Lüning has published over 20 peer-reviewed papers in the field of geology and is the co-author of the IPCC critical book “The Neglected Sun“.
Photo Lüning: www.kaltesonne.de/
He summarizes: “Once you boil down the science, there no case left for alarm.” He continues:
When I read the reports in the mainstream media, I was shocked that some of the key findings were not properly reported: unexpected warming stop during the last 15 years not explainable by current models, the Medieval Warm Period in at least parts of the world was as warm as today. This should have been reported. Instead they wrote that the sea level threat increased, which is not really true. There has been no acceleration of sea level in the past few decades and a large European Research Consortium has recently ruled out the most scary sea level prognoses (European Research Consortium dismisses extreme sea level rise prognoses). The East Antarctic Ice Cap and Arctic sea ice trend actually is growing, drought and storm occurrences are well within the limits of natural variability. Current Greenland temperatures are on the level of the 1930s. Forget the models, the real data show that there is no cause for any alarm.”
Lüning also left a reader comment at NoTricksZone. One part of his comment is worth mentioning again (my emphasis):
We argue mostly with historical and geological data which clearly show that natural climate factors always played a key role in pre-industrial times, hence also today. Interestingly, we have not found any hard evidence for CO2 having been a climate driver in the past. Therefore we say that half the warming of the last 150 years could be man-made at most. This is a maximum value. It could also be that CO2 has not been involved at all or only marginally in the warming we have seen.”
Also veteran meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt at donnerwetter.de had some criticism for the IPCC.

Some excerpts of what he wrote:
The warming stop of the last 15 years gets explained by the oceans absorbing heat more strongly. This stop in warming is hardly treated critically in the report, and thus the prognoses for the next years are everything but certain. …
Concerning the impacts of climate change, the uncertainties are very high. For example the prognoses for Europe can all be questionable because the margin of error is so large. ….
The global community must act, but how? This is precisely the crux of the problem. From climate science we tend to see ideological suggestions where economic growth is viewed negatively. But here strong growth could help the planet to develop technologies and ideas against climate change. The idea coming from many economic philosophers that man has to be steered away from outer targets of prosperity and towards an inner target of self-fulfillment may be well intentioned, but it is hardly accepted by a broader audience, and not all by poor countries.
The best solution is probably a gradual, soft transition to an energy base that focusses on CO2 avoidance globally over the next 50 to 100 years.”
To be fair. Dr. Brandt thinks that rising CO2 emissions do pose risks that cannot be ignored, and that it is a good idea to get away from fossil fuels.

Today’s face of the day is **National MP Matt King** who caused Green party and MSM heads to explode when he posted the following on his Facebook page:



Some words ( not all ) of wisdom taken from NZCPR website.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



To suffer, not prosper; to despair, not dream.



I would start with energy.



I’d cut off much of New Zealand’s supply of cheap, abundant energy. I couldn’t take it by force. So, I’d make New Zealanders feel guilty for using the energy that heats their homes, fuels their cars, runs their businesses, and powers their economy.



I’d make cheap energy expensive, so that expensive energy would seem cheap.



I would all-but-outlaw New Zealand’s abundant sources of oil, gas and coal – making it necessary to import it from overseas.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I’d use our schools to teach one generation of children that our factories and cars and cows are causing runaway Global Warming, and I’d muster a straight face so I could teach the next generation that their parents are to blame for killing the planet.



And when it’s cold outside, I’d call it Climate Change instead.



I’d imply that New Zealand’s cities and factories could run on hydro, wind and solar power, without a fossil fuel backup for when the rain doesn’t fall, the wind doesn’t blow, and the sun doesn’t shine.



I’d teach children how to ignore the hypocrisy of condemning logging, mining and farming — while having roofs over their heads, heat in their homes and food on their tables.



I would ridicule as “deniers” those who question the climate scaremongering of politicians, and when they remind people about the laws of nature – that climate change is natural and mankind’s impact is minimal – I’d enlist a sympathetic media to drown them out.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail…**



I would create countless new regulations and seldom cancel old ones. They would be so complicated that only bureaucrats, lawyers and lobbyists could understand them. That way small businesses with big ideas wouldn’t stand a chance.



I would never teach children that the free market is the only force in human history to uplift the poor, establish the middle class and create lasting prosperity.



Instead, I’d demonise wealth creators, property owners, and prosperity itself, so they will not miss what they will never have.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I would empower bureaucrats to bully Kiwis out of their dreams and their property rights by imposing such strict and costly regulations that it’d be almost impossible for farmers to farm, miners to mine, loggers to log, and builders to build.



And because I don’t believe in free markets, I’d invent false ones. I’d devise fictitious products – like carbon credits – and trade them in imaginary markets. I’d convince people that this would create jobs and be good for the economy, but I would never say where the new jobs will be found.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



For every concern, I’d invent a crisis; and for every crisis, I’d invent a cause; like shutting down entire industries and killing tens of thousands of jobs in the name of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and saving the planet. And when everyone learned the stunning irony that imported oil and gas and coal would create more emissions than home-grown products, it would already be decades too late.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I’d make it easier to stop commerce than start it – easier to kill jobs than create them – more fashionable to resent success than to seek it.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I would transform the environmental agenda from a document of conservation to an economic suicide pact. I would concede entire industries like farming and mining and exploration to our economic rivals by imposing regulations that cost billions. I would celebrate those who preach environmental austerity in public while indulging lavish lifestyles in private.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I’d convince New Zealanders that capitalism is harmful, and that socialism and more regulation is the answer.



I would prey on the goodness and decency of ordinary New Zealanders.



I would only need to convince them … that all of this is for the greater good.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail, I suppose I wouldn’t change a thing.**



Roll on election 2020.

"The electric car trend is still to take off in the UK, with drivers largely put off by up-front costs, according to a survey by the Department for Transport. A measly 5% of respondents were thinking about buying an electric car or van, and only a fifth of them were considering doing so in the near future. Just 0.3% already owned an electric vehicle meaning that, at best, there are a little over one in 20 people who have any interest at all in owning an electric car. In contrast, 14% had contemplated buying a car or van but decided against it, while the most damning statistic is that over half, 56%, had not even thought about the possibility of going electric. There are areas where electric vehicles have established themselves as part of everyday life. There are few more British sights than the electric milk float going about its door-to-door deliveries at the crack of dawn. There are also many successful industrial applications of electric vehicles, such as fork lift trucks or pallet moving vehicles. The reason these applications have had traction is that there is an identifiable niche that the electric powered vehicle option fulfils better than conventional engines. The milk delivery benefits from a quiet electric engine which doesn’t wake up the snoozing masses. Similarly, regulations and health and safety concerns makes electric engines a better choice than petrol and diesel in factories. But for the general public, electric vehicles seem irrelevant. Up to three quarters of the electric cars and vans on the road in the UK are run by businesses and local authorities in fleets, where they can play a major role in meeting emissions targets and improving operating costs. Despite this, electric vehicle sales are often claimed as “record breaking” and at an “all-time-highs” in Britain. Unsurprising, since they are coming from such a low base. Indeed, the latest figures show a spectacular increase of some 121% on pure electric car sales from this time last year, with almost 2,000 such vehicles purchased in 2014. But that figure looks weak in comparison with the 1.1m cars sold overall this year – it is in fact just 0.2% of the overall market. Buyers in other European markets are more positive towards electric cars. In Denmark and the Netherlands, electric vehicles make up 5% of all cars, rising to 20% in Norway where there are more than 35,000 electric vehicles on the road amongst a population of less than 5m. Success in a market like Norway can be attributed less to environmental consciousness than it can well-advised economics: it’s possible to save up to £1,000 a year running an electric vehicle.  They also get a number of benefits including VAT exemption, free car tax, parking and road tolls, as well as various employment tax benefits. In addition, conventional cars (with internal combustion engines) are subject to numerous heavy taxes, including a road use tax and a CO2 tax that makes Norwegian petrol the most expensive in the world.  Of course, electric cars also receive government incentives in the UK – most notably the purchase cost reduction of up to £5,000 (£8,000 for vans). But even with this the electric options are still notably more expensive than internal combustion engine equivalents. The subsidy also seems to affect second-hand car value, which depreciates markedly.  There is also free car tax, which saves you up to £470 a year, and exemption from the London congestion charge of £9 a day, though these incentives are also available to many low emission diesel models, and some low emission petrol vehicles too – of course, hybrid electrics are included too. This rewards system is less favourable in comparison to that in Norway, where the total incentives on offer will amount to roughly half the price of the car.  But it is the running costs in the UK that will save the buyer the most, with a difference of £200 a year to power an electric such as the Nissan Leaf versus £1,300 for a similar sized petrol model. However, despite the impressive value here, many will be put off by the high purchase costs. The Department for Transport survey highlights how emphasising running cost savings could improve the public attitude. A massive 85% of respondents saw cost as the most important factor to consider when buying a car. At the same time, a third were put off electric vehicles because of the cost – second only to battery issues around so called range anxiety and doubts over present technology, which can be overcome with education, experience and improving infrastructure. Overall, reducing cost was the most popular means to encourage electric vehicle sales, in line with a US survey in one of the most successful electric vehicle markets in the world, California, where 37% of owners were driven by economic not environmental concerns. There are other means to get the benefit from electric vehicles such as car sharing and car clubs, options which have the potential to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper. But we appear wedded to a consumer capitalist car system whereby private ownership is all-important. While commentators may believe we are at a tipping point, significant market penetration of electric cars is still some time away unless these cars and vans become (and are widely seen as) more affordable for ordinary people."
"The experience of visiting a zoo is about to change dramatically. The Next Generation Zoo concept is based on how animals use space in the wild, giving them more freedom and better using the resources available to most zoos. Take Philadelphia Zoo, for example. It is a small, city-based institution, which like many zoos has suffered from the lack of space or opportunity to expand. In the past, this has meant animals were restricted to limiting enclosures. But new walkways between enclosures are allowing monkeys and now tigers greater freedom of movement. The way animals use space in the wild is actually quite similar to the way  we humans use space. Wildlife biologists call the space a wild animal uses its home range or its territory. I have travelled to all seven continents and even to the North Pole, so my home range is the whole planet. But because I only really use a few areas with a high frequency, such as my home, work and relatives’ houses, these areas probably account for 95% of my space use. The rest is travelling between the three main areas I use or sporadic visits to exotic places. Many animal species in the wild do a similar thing: they have a few places they like to sleep, some drinking points, social gathering space, toilet areas and places they go to find food. Thus, while a wild monkey might have a home range of 12 hectares Brazilian rainforest, in reality it only uses one hectare distributed across a few points of its home range. Field biologists call this its “core area”. What this tells us is that animals (rather like humans) spend a lot of time commuting from frequently used place to frequently used place. While people might complain about the need to commute, this is more related to crowded public transport than the actual travelling. May is National Walking Month and if it were practical most people would find walking a more rewarding experience than mechanised transport. If our species was designed to do one thing well, by evolution, it is walking – something our ancestors had to do to fulfil their survival needs. Not to mention it helps with many diseases including obesity. Next Generation Zoos have embraced this concept by creating raceways that allow animals to walk around the zoo. The Philadelphia Zoo has hundreds of metres of mesh tubes, which monkeys can walk along and substantial raceways that tigers can track along. These are not roads to nowhere – some of them may end in viewing points and others in a different enclosure.   So, rather like a train-line, these raceways can connect animal enclosures together, expanding the areas open to species for exploration and exercise. As well as giving them more space, animals get more freedom to use different spaces for different activities, such as sleeping or foraging much as they would in the wild. So while due to planning or other restrictions a zoo may not be able to construct a huge tiger enclosure this does not matter as you can connect many small enclosures together. It can also allow social species to choose with whom they are going to hang out. This is the idea behind Philadelphia Zoo’s 360° concept, designed by Jon Coe. Taking the concept of train-line system of raceways further by including nodes, which are essentially junction boxes, a zoo can start to rotate animals between enclosures. For example, an enclosure that is escape-proof for a bear will also keep in a big cat. Thus, depending on the number of enclosures in the zoo a species could have access to tens of different enclosures during a year by being rotated through them. Once the herbivores have been rotated elsewhere, predators could be given access to their enclosures, which would be a very stimulating experience for them. The map of a zoo would start to look like the London Underground with the animals having vast arrays of opportunities to choose where they are going. It is likely that many animals will enjoy the journey of travelling around the zoo above the public, experiencing new sights and sounds. Feeding stations, toys and viewing points can be included in the raceways making them more interesting to the animals. In terms of animal welfare, this system will allow animals to use the zoo environment more as they would use their habitat in the wild. They will no longer need to stare at the same old four walls for the rest of their life. Instead, they will have the opportunity to travel and go to different places. This will be beneficial for both mental and physical wellbeing. Zoo animals, just like their human visitors, are becoming overweight. I have seen zoo-housed crocodiles with potbellies, something we never see in the wild, and this issue can be best addressed by promoting physical activity. For the visitor, these changes should make zoos more dynamic institutions and less like museums. Because animals are on the move, it’ll be necessary to seek out the ones you want to see, making the experience much more like the wild. This will make animal viewing a more rewarding experience. The thrill of seeing a wild animal is in part the hunt. While the cost of implementing this kind of system is not cheap, it will be considerably cheaper than building new exhibits. I for one think it will encourage zoos to renovate enclosures rather than constructing news ones or building many, potentially smaller, simpler spaces that animals need, such as a sleeping space, a watering hole or just a place to admire the view over a lake. I think the orang-utans and their friends are going to like these changes."

One must be careful not to express hurty feelings in today’s snowflake world. At least that is what Alan Jones is finding out. He’s been told by his employer that if he makes any more remarks along the lines of suggesting Scott Morrison should shove a sock down Jacinda Ardern’s throat he’ll have his contract terminated. 



What shouldn’t be overlooked in this is the small matter of a nervous man at a bank terminating a lucrative advertising contract with the station. I wonder what was uppermost in Macquarie Media Chairman Russell Tate’s mind when hauling Jones over the coals? Mr Tate should bear in mind that Alan Jones is number one in the news talk ratings and without ratings, he’ll find it’s not just the nervous man at the bank terminating his advertising.



What also shouldn’t be overlooked is the rather larger matter of free speech. Alan Jones is employed as a talkback host to broadcast his opinions on matters he feels will be of interest to his listeners. They may not necessarily reflect the views of the organisation that employs him but that should not be his concern. His job is to get ratings to attract advertising so the company can make a profit and make little Mr Tate look good.



Scott Morrison said the comments were “disappointing” and “way out of line”. “I have two daughters so you can expect that’s how I would personally feel about it”. What is that supposed to mean? Does he mean that the comments are okay if directed at a man but not acceptable if at a woman? What sort of lily-livered world are we living in? In high profile positions, whether held by male or female, what comes with the territory is the same. I find Mr Morrison’s comments disappointing.



Jaqueline Maley writing in the Sydney Morning Herald said Ardern’s crime was to “lecture” Australia about climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum. She writes that the extent of what she said was that Australia “has to answer to the Pacific” on its climate policy, which is an outrage precisely because it’s stating the obvious, and who does she think she is to do that. Jaqueline, who describes herself as a columnist and senior journalist, is obviously not bright enough to realise that therein lies the crime which is one of hypocrisy.



Alan has to be mindful of what he says but Jacinda can go freely slagging off Australia for treating coal mining, a major contributor to their economy, the same way as we treat agriculture for exactly the same reason. Why is no one saying that we must answer to the Pacific in the same way? This is precisely why Alan Jones, quite rightly, suggested Scott Morrison should (metaphorically) shove a sock down her throat. 



Australia shouldn’t have to wear blatant hypocrisy from an utter lightweight and a complete clown. I notice those comments haven’t been disputed in the ensuing fiasco so we must assume that we can take them to be an accurate and honest description of the person concerned.



According to Alex Carey of news.com.au a slew of companies, namely four, have deserted Alan’s programme. One of the companies, Koala said “climate change is real, violence against women starts with words and the bloke has had too many chances”. Give me strength! I ask you, who are the pussies running that outfit? They don’t sound very Aussie to me.

"The UK’s climate change targets are world-leading. Yet there is no clear plan in place to achieve them. That is the stark message of a new progress report from the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. The Committee is forthright in its criticism of government. On its report card, assessing progress against 25 policies needed to meet carbon targets, there is just one green tick. But, beyond asking for the prime minister to set up a “climate cabinet”, the Committee has much less to say about how government – at both national and local level – should be reconfigured to make climate action a priority. The stark truth is that no one is in charge. Under the UK’s Climate Change Act, there is a statutory requirement on the government as a whole to meet targets. This leaves the prime minister with ultimate authority, but no clarity about which department should do what. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) oversees progress, but other departments have no carbon targets or responsibilities, and BEIS cannot tell them what to do. Neither are there targets or responsibilities for local areas. The Committee on Climate Change can offer advice, but the route between this advice and policy delivery is, to put it politely, unclear. This results in some serious contradictions. Transport results in a quarter of the UK’s emissions, yet the Department for Transport’s strategic plan, published just last month, fails to mention climate action as a key driver. There is the odd reference to “clean growth” and “sustainability”, but also support for airport expansion and many new roads. The only policy that unequivocally contributes to the effort is the pledge to phase out diesel and petrol cars by 2040, which most commentators, including the CCC, have said is too little, too late. Meanwhile, the Treasury and BEIS work together to maximise oil and gas extraction from the North Sea. When questioned by MPs, they dismissed the idea that this is incompatible with climate targets. The energy regulator, Ofgem, has a duty to protect consumers, but again, no clear carbon target or responsibility. As a result, many of its day-to-day decisions, like the recent review of charging arrangements for electricity networks, work against the transition to zero-carbon. Examples like this abound across government and its agencies. At local level, the picture is no clearer. Local authorities have no statutory responsibility, and no specific resources, for climate action. Many have now shouldered responsibility by declaring a “climate emergency”, but when it comes to action they have limited control over policies and budgets, and little room for manoeuvre. As part of the IGov project at the University of Exeter, I have been helping to develop proposals for an institutional framework which would enable coordinated climate strategy, to implement the transition to zero-carbon. We advocate allocating carbon targets to each government department.  We also propose a sister organisation to the Committee on Climate Change, which we are calling the “Energy Transformation Commission”. This body would implement the transformation process set by government, through a process of brokering, coordination, consensus-building and engagement. The ETC would take advice from the Committee on Climate Change and the National Infrastructure Commission, and works with all government departments. It would be a focal point for crucial decisions that need cross-government coordination, like the transition to electric vehicles, and decarbonisation of home heating – two areas where the CCC says policies are lagging behind. At local level, we advocate devolving climate governance to local authorities. This should take the form of a new statutory duty on local authorities, requiring them to produce a transformation plan, which includes setting and meeting devolved carbon budgets. Central government should give local authorities the freedom and funding to enable this process, letting them coordinate across energy, planning, transport and economic development. Being clearer about climate responsibilities across government would provide the vital link between statutory targets and the policies to achieve them. It would make the policymaking process more transparent and less open to lobbying by those who stand to lose from decisive policy. Our research on the UK energy sector has shown that big energy companies, rather than the emerging innovators, have a disproportionate influence over governance decisions. Opening up climate strategy to public debate would also strengthen the government’s hand: research shows that people want to see climate action, but are currently cut out of decisions. The recent decision by six parliamentary select committees to hold a citizens’ assembly on climate change is an encouraging step toward climate democracy. It’s only been a month since the UK legislated for net-zero. Over the coming months, crucial decisions about implementation will be needed. There is nothing more critical than deciding who is in charge.

The other day I noted that the budget cuts agreed to last week contained lots of familiar faces. Many of the agencies and programs getting a trim were also cut in 1995 in a rescissions package put together by Gingrich Republicans. In the fifteen intervening years, federal spending exploded across the board, which means that an occasional trim job doesn’t accomplish much if the goal is to limit government.   
  
  
The reason why is that if the scope of government activities isn’t curtailed, the cuts will be short‐​lived. As long as the agencies and their programs remain, special interests won’t stop agitating Congress to continue, or more likely, increase, funding.   
  
  
A recent article in _The Hill_ reports that lobbyists are already hard at work: 



Groups that advocate for everything from more foreign aid to bolstering the nation’s transportation system saw several of their favorite government programs suffer deep spending cuts in the fiscal year 2011 budget deal.   
  
  
With millions of dollars now axed from what they consider key federal initiatives, groups are planning to redouble their efforts and lobby to restore as much funding as possible in next year’s budget.



(Note to reporter: A lot of adjectives could be used to describe the spending cuts. “Deep” is not one of them.)   
  
  
A fellow who lobbies for foreign aid argues that cutting it won’t balance the budget and that “We need to be planting the seeds for future economic prosperity around the world.” It’s true that even _eliminating_ foreign aid wouldn’t balance the budget, but every little bit helps. But what’s striking is his arrogant pronouncement that “we” (taxpayers) need to be forced by the federal government to send our money abroad for the causes he fancies.   
  
  
A lobbyist with the National League of Cities is relieved that the GOP didn’t get the small cut in local handouts that were originally proposed, but is nonetheless concerned about the “anti‐​spending climate in Washington”: 



‘We’re talking about staff layoffs at the city level. Cities are also going to have completely reorganize their budgets mid‐​year and prioritize some things out.’   
  
  
‘In this environment, the numbers from fiscal year 2011 might be the new baseline but our message isn’t going to change,’ Wallace said. ‘We’re focusing on those local programs that create jobs and spur economic growth.’



Cities prioritizing spending? Heaven forbid. Suck more money out of the private sector in order to save bureaucratic deadweight in local government? That doesn’t sound like a recipe for economic growth to me. (See here for more on the problems with federal subsidies to state and local governments.)   
  
  
Then there are the transportation lobbyists. These folks would probably argue that a giant escalator to nowhere would be a wise use of taxpayer money: 



Dean’s group is lamenting spending cuts made to the high‐​speed rail program, transit security grants as well as funding for “fixed guideway” projects, which include commuter trains, cable cars and ferryboats among other public transit systems.



For the fans of _The Simpsons_ who didn’t catch the escalator reference, see this link for my feelings on government‐​funded rail projects. (Fans and non‐​fans should check out these essays on urban transit subsidies and high‐​speed rail.)   
  
  
In Washington, it’s the squeaky wheel that gets greased. Lobbyists for government programs exist to make sure that Congress hears their wheel squeaking. Yes, the deck is stacked against those who are forced to foot the bill, but if taxpayers want federal agencies and their programs to get more than a trimming every fifteen years or so, now is the time to make a lot more noise.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German national weather service (Deutsche Wetterdienst – DWD) writes in its latest press release on how 2013 is shaping up climate-wise in Germany. No warming anywhere!
In fact, the recent trend looks like a strong cooling.
Already regions in the German lowlands have seen frost this fall – which is early. For 2013 so far the DWD writes:
The mean temperature for the first 9 months of 2013 (January to September) in Germany was 9.5°C. That corresponds to the mean for the 1961-1990 reference period, 9.4°C. But it was significantly below the mean of the warmer comparison period of 1981 – 2010, 10.2°C.”
So far Germany’s 2013 is running 0.7°C below the 1981 – 2010 reference period. The DWD lists the top 9 warmest years in Germany since 1880: 






2000
9,9


2001
9,9


2002
9,7


2003
9,6


2004
9,6


2005
9,6


2006
9,5


2007
9,5


2008
9,5



Table source: DWD.
By sheer coincidence the warmest year was 2000 with each subsequent year getting progressively cooler. 2013 is not anywhere near the top, which means that it is one of the coldest this century. I guess the warmist DWD chose the tabular format because the trend is not obvious to the reader’s eye. Hiding inconvenient trends is very much in vogue nowadays. Since 1880, the mean temperature for Germany is 8.2°C, the DWD says.
Glaciers in Swiss Alps gain in mass
There are more signs that things are cooling down globally, in stark contradiction to what the IPCC scientists insist.

Hajo Smit of climategate.nl writes about a report appearing at the Swiss Schweiz am Sonntag. The article is titled: “The First Glaciers Are Growing Again” with the introduction: “2013 was a good summer for the Swiss Alps. The glaciers lost the least amount of ice in 10 years.”
The report quotes glaciologist Matthias Huss:
‘This is the least ice melt I’ve seen in a long time. It appears that they even slightly gained in mass,’ says glaciologist Matthias Huss of the University of Freiburg. This positive development can be traced back to the snowy and long winter. ‘And even though July and August were very hot, the thick snow cover protected the ice.'”
I have to remind readers that it’s not only Swiss Alps glaciers who are ignoring the IPCC, but so are the Himalayan glaciers.
Flashback: last year Die kalte Sonne site posted a story titled “Surprise: Himalayan Glaciers Have Not Lost Any ICE In The Last 10 Years!“. Die kalte Sonne writes:
Using GRACE satellite measurements, a team of researchers from the University of Boulder and the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR in Colorado (USA) were able to document that the glaciers in the Himalayas and surrounding mountains. … The IPCC warned in its last report of 2007 that all Himalayan glaciers would melt away by the year 2035.
And if the IPCC were not credible enough, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research director Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber said that the Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035 was “very easy to calculate“. So it has to be true!
Later of course this assertion was exposed as purely preposterous. The original publication of the Himalayan glacier melt stop is in Nature: Jacob et al. 2012 .

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
A reader who posts under the name “tokyoboy” sent a link to a very interesting sea level record from the Japanese Meteorological Agency. It covers the period 1906–2010, and when I first saw it I thought they’d made some mistake.
So I got their data, and plotted it up. I also got the satellite records for the area. Finally, I got records of one of the sites that the Japanese used, but I obtained it from the PSMSL records. All of them agree very well, so I am forced to assume that there are no obvious errors in the Japanese records. Figure 1 shows the results:
Figure 1. Japanese sea level records. Two records marked “Japan” are from the citation above. They are averages of long-term records since 1906 (4 sites, blue line), and shorter-term records since 1960 (16 sites, red line). Satellite records (green, 1993-2010) are from the University of Colorado interactive wizard. Wajima records (purple, 1930-2010) are from the PSMSL. 
You can see why I thought there was a mistake. Sea level around Japan rose steadily from 1906 to 1950. Then it dropped for fifteen years and bounced around until 1980. Since then it has risen again, but it is about 20 mm lower than it was in 1950.

Now, I can’t find anything at all wrong with the data. The satellite record agrees with the Japanese averages, as does the PSMSL record. So we have to assume it is accurate.
But it is unlike any record I’ve seen of the global average change in sea level. That global record climbs steadily over the century.

I’m happy for suggestions and comments, as I’m in mystery over this one. It’s one of the great things about the climate, always more puzzles to solve.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now we have over 65% more Arctic sea ice area, a record high sea ice area around Antarctica, a record low tornado season, record late start start hurricane season, 15 years of no global warming, a cooling tropical Pacific and a “strongly cooling Southern Ocean”.

At Twitter Axel Bojanowski links to his Spiegel article describing a climate science that is more confused and uncertain than ever.
The above are just some examples illustrating just how embarrassingly wrong climate science has been. But hey! The PIK says Munich had a record warm Christmas day last year!
Just breaking is the study that blames a cooling tropical Pacific for the stall in global warming, and it is hitting the climate science community like a meteor. If anything, it confirms that natural climate cycles do dominate after all.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi commented: “You gotta love these guys ‘discovering’ what all of us have been saying.”
Spiegel: Hockey Stick “has lost its weight”
Reaction is now coming from Spiegel. Axel Bojanowski starts by reminding readers: “The climate has not warmed further in 15 years” despite rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The temperature hockey stick is also broken. Here Bojanowski writes that “the recent climate development means that it has lost its weight” and that 98% of the climate models had made false forecasts, citing a new study by German scientists.”
Bojanowski explains how the oceans appear to be absorbing heat and keeping the global atmospheric temperature stable, saying that most of the energy ends up in the oceans; “They absorb about 90% of the heat.” But this is not a discovery, and is something the skeptics have been saying for years. It’s actually one of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s central themes in their book THE NEGLECTED SUN, for which they were viciously attacked and ridiculed by the German science and media establishment just last year. Now we see they were right.
Recall that the strong El Nino events of the 1980s and 1990s were ominous signs of global warming as heat trapped by CO2 was warming the ocean surface. Now, suddenly when things are cooling, it’s the other way around: the oceans are cooling the atmosphere!
Bojanowski explains that although the tropical East Pacific covers only a twelfth of the Earth’s surface, the cool surface waters there have kept the global temperature from rising over the last years. Spiegel writes that leading climatologists such as Stefan Brönnimann of the University of Bern, Doug Smith of the Met Office, and Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research say that the explanation has considerable merit.
Bojanowski explains that it’s a mystery to scientists as to why the Pacific would cool in the first place. But not everyone is convinced that this is the explanation for the recent global warming stop. Kevin Trenberth for example still hasn’t found his missing heat. Spiegel writes:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The study does not explain in any way the unusual temperature development,” says Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA (NOAA). An explanation is missing as to where the heat may have gone. A team led by Trenberth recently were able to show that the deep ocean may have swallowed up a third of the global warming.”
Quadruple whammy
Bojanowski then looks at other possible explanations for the “missing heat”, writing that there may have been “changes in the Earth’s radiation budget.”
For example upper atmospheric layers have dried out over the past years. The water vapor there acts as a heat buffer. The aridity of the stratosphere has contributed to the pause in the warming, scientists report.”
Bojanoski also brings up that volcanoes or Chinese aerosols may have dimmed out the warming. The whole thing is an increasingly baffling mystery to the scientists.
On stratosphere, is Spiegel describing the 4th component of a quadruple whammy? Already we have: 1) low solar activity, 2) a negative PDO, 3) a starting negative AMO and now 4) a dried out stratosphere that lets massive amounts of heat radiate out into space. Sounds like the potent ingredients of a nasty mini ice age.
Burgeoning confusion taking over climate science
To add to the ever burgeoning climate science confusion and uncertainty, Spiegel also quotes Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz-Center for Ocean Sciences in Kiel, Germany (Latif correctly predicted that the oceans would stop the warming in 2008).
The Southern Ocean has cooled strongly over the last decades; it must have contributed to the pause in global warming.”
With all the uncertainty and surprises, you’d think the alarmists would start reconsidering their positions. But you’d be wrong. They still remain devout CO2 believers, desperately clinging to their CO2 and models. Expect them to go into total spin mode to salvage what they can. But no matter what they do, one thing is now clearer than ever: The models have been dead wrong, and the scientists are more confused than ever about the climate. They are hopelessly stumped. Spiegel writes at the end:
Also the British Met Office believes that the global warming pause, will continue for a few more years. However, the temperature buffer of the oceans is only temporary, Brönnimann believes. The greenhouse gases will unleash their warming impacts, postulates the UN climate report, which will soon be released. It’s quite possible that even an accelerated warming phase is coming.”
Now I am laughing myself to near death…not at Spiegel, but at the devout alarmists. In a nutshell: At present the alarmists are more perplexed than ever, yet they want us to believe they are totally certain about the future? The climate charlatans are now looking more and more like obstinate fools.

"As a therapist, I was drawn to the Guardian long read (Therapy Under Lockdown: ‘I’m just as terrified as my patients are’, 23 April) but it didn’t resonate with me. What’s interesting to me is that we are not all necessarily “hapless victims” with “nothing to do but cower in our homes”. Many of us value slowing down, blue skies, clean air, and newly discovered neighbours.  Some couples are facing each other more squarely and experiencing breakthroughs – some parents are enjoying more time with their children. Others struggling with understandable anxiety are valuing the support of therapy. Video sessions – for some – seem to offer greater opportunities for intimacy than face-to-face interactions. Differing experiences of lockdown may, in many cases, be circumstantial. As for whether therapy can help – perhaps, having trained more recently than Gary Greenberg, I’ve benefited from a different approach. As a hospice practitioner and bereavement counsellor, I learned the value of facing mortality and preparing for death. Furthermore, my professional training at Re-Vision was a training in uncertainty. We were profoundly aware of climate change and environmental destruction – problems we likely wouldn’t solve. We didn’t embark on our careers with the belief that we could necessarily “name our pain” and move on. We learned the art of bearing the seemingly unbearable. In answer, therefore, to Greenberg’s question “Is there a role for therapy in a pandemic?” mine is a very resounding “Yes!”Celia UrbachLondon • There has been some concern in the psychotherapy community about the way our work is depicted in Gary Greenberg’s account of moving his psychotherapy practice online in the context of the current pandemic, not least among those who work with populations of refugees, homeless people, BAME and others who are not strangers to being helpless and unsafe. Some of us have spent decades dragging psychotherapy beyond a ghetto of white, western, middle-class privilege, and into the real world of multiculturalism, social inequality and postcolonial consciousness. Presenting a pre-1960s, US, private-practice version as representative of psychotherapy in the 21st century is a somewhat less than helpful contribution.Dick BlackwellMember of the Institute of Group Analysis and of the Psychotherapy and Counselling Union"
"Many scientists believe that halting global warming at 1.5°C will require us to invent Negative Emission Technologies – machines that can suck climate warming gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air. But such technology already exists and has done for over two billion years. From the trees outside your window to the microscopic algae in the ocean, nature is working hard to absorb the atmospheric carbon that is heating our world. Rather than reinvent the wheel, some experts are calling for natural solutions to climate change. These involve restoring natural habitats – such as forests and wetlands – which would draw down CO₂ through photosynthesis and store it as living tissue in plants.  Rapidly phasing out greenhouse gas emissions is still vital, but letting nature do much of the hard work in removing the CO₂ that’s already in the atmosphere could save the time and money we’d need to develop artificial methods of capturing carbon.

      George Monbiot Q + A – How rejuvenating nature could help fight climate change


 Returning many of the world’s ecosystems to something resembling their former glory could also help solve another crisis simultaneously. In this fourth issue of the Imagine newsletter, we look at the mass extinction crisis that threatens the nearly nine million species on Earth and how radical action to prevent their extinction could also prevent ours. We asked experts to imagine how natural solutions to climate change could start at home and what a future with more of the wild in our lives might look like. In the end, it’s a case of saving two birds with one tree.  What is Imagine? Imagine is a newsletter from The Conversation that presents a vision of a world acting on climate change. Drawing on the collective wisdom of academics in fields from anthropology and zoology to technology and psychology, it investigates the many ways life on Earth could be made fairer and more fulfilling by taking radical action on climate change. You are currently reading the web version of the newsletter. Here’s the more elegant email-optimised version subscribers receive. To get Imagine delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe now.  Nearly a million species are at risk of extinction without “transformative changes” to the way societies and economies are organised in the 21st century. That’s according to a report published in May 2019 by an international team studying Earth’s biodiversity.

      'Revolutionary change' needed to stop unprecedented global extinction crisis


 Climate change drives species to extinction and exacerbates threats such as habitat loss, by destroying the habitats themselves or changing the conditions that make them hospitable to different species. But it might surprise you to learn that across vast swathes of the world, nature is already returning to places where dense habitats were once destroyed by humans. Even on your own doorstep, your local environment could be wilder than it was 100 years ago.  If you live in mainland Europe, that’s almost certainly the case.

      Rewilding: as farmland and villages are abandoned, forests, wolves and bears are returning to Europe


 More and more people around the world are abandoning rural landscapes and moving to live in cities. In their absence, the land they once used for agriculture is regenerating as shrubland and forest. These new habitats have ushered in wolves, brown bears, lynx and boar. José M. Rey Benayas, Professor of Ecology at the University of Alcalá, says: Despite 40% of the world’s land being cultivated or grazed permanently by domestic herbivores… forests returned at a rate of 2.2 million hectares per year between 2010-2015 alone. Spain, for example, has tripled its forest area since 1900 – increasing from 8% to 25% of its territory. The country gained 96,000 hectares of forest every year from 2000-2015. In the UK, forests have recovered more slowly, from 5% of the land area after World War I to 13% today. It’s been estimated that every hectare of forest that’s restored in the UK could absorb the annual emissions of 30 London buses or 90 cars every year. Restoring forest cover in the UK to just 18% of the land area could absorb a quarter of the carbon that will need to be cut in order to reach net zero emissions by 2050. 


      Read more:
      Rewilding is essential to the UK’s commitment to zero carbon emissions


 Aside from not emitting carbon in the first place, restoring forests across the world on an unprecedented scale could be our best bet for avoiding catastrophic climate change, according to a new study. Mark Maslin, a Professor of Earth System Science and Simon Lewis, a Professor of Global Change, both at University College London, explain the thinking. Negative emissions – Increasing the world’s forest land by one third – regrowing an extra billion hectares of trees over an area that’s roughly the size of the United States – could capture 205 billion tonnes of CO₂, according to the study. That’s about two thirds of man-made carbon emissions already in the atmosphere. Low disruption – The study’s authors say reforestation on this scale could actually be achieved with fairly limited disruption to our lives. Most of the land needed would be around 1.8 billion hectares in areas with low human activity, so new forests wouldn’t have to compete with land we’d need to reserve for growing food.  But there’s a catch – Even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C, the higher temperatures could reduce the area that’s suitable for forest restoration by a fifth by 2050. On its own, reforestation isn’t enough. There’s still a very urgent need to reduce emissions drastically for a reasonable chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change. As Maslin and Lewis point out, the actual sum of CO₂ that reforestation could lock away is also much smaller in other research, perhaps closer to 57 billion tonnes.

      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Reforesting the Earth will take decades, but right now, people in the UK could help bring back one of the country’s most diminished habitats in their own backyards. Since the end of World War II, Britain has lost 97% of its wild grassland – turned into farmland or dug up to build roads and homes.  What’s left is a sorry sight. The clipped lawns and neat grass verges of Britain mostly contain only one or two species of turf grass, compared to the more than 40 plant species that can thrive in a single square metre of grassland. As their native habitat has declined, British pollinating insects have vanished from a third of their range since 1980.

      Four steps to make your lawn a wildlife haven – from green desert to miniature rainforest


 Maintaining the hyper-manicured lawns that we’re used to seeing in public parks often involves petrol mowers and fertilisers which leak more carbon to the atmosphere during their production and use than the grass itself can store. If you have a lawn, you can think of it as your own patch of artificial grassland – a stunted remnant of a once vast ecosystem. But it needn’t be that way, says Adam Bates – an ecologist at Nottingham Trent University. There are four easy steps any gardener can follow to turn their lawn into a wildlife haven that locks away CO₂. 1. Cut higher Most lawn mowers have blades that are set as low to the ground as possible, ensuring that the lawn is cut to be flat and featureless, which is no good for wildlife. Bugs and small creatures need nooks and crannies to hide from predators. Spiders in particular need something to anchor their webs to. By adjusting the blade to the highest possible setting – often around 4 cm off the ground – mowing can leave taller grass with more recesses for insects to hide in. 2. Include mowing gaps Leaving longer gaps between mowing the lawn can give wildflower species the time they need to flower and provide nectar for pollinating insects to eat. By leaving a gap in spring, early flowering species like the native cowslip can bloom.  Cowslip is a plant which has been declining for decades, but the Duke of Burgundy butterfly depends on it for somewhere to lay its eggs. Leaving a mowing gap in summer can give species like cat’s-ear and fox-and-cub time to flower – both important food sources for leafcutter bees. 3. Don’t use fertilisers or herbicides You might expect herbicides to be a bad idea, but when it comes to lawns, fertilisers are only good for ensuring a luxuriant green colour – one or two grass species will soak up the extra nutrients and outcompete everything else.  To ensure a rich variety of plants can thrive in your wildflower lawn, reducing the fertility of the soil is essential. 4. Remove the clippings By collecting the cut grass after you mow you can stop more nutrients getting into the soil and reduce the lawn’s fertility with every cut.  If you’re 100% committed, you can leave strips at the sides or patches in the corners to go wild and form small wildflower meadows. Most wildflower seeds will be carried to your garden on the wind or by birds, but if you’re tired of waiting, you  can buy and spread the seeds yourself. Once you’ve seen pockets of wildflower meadow spring up on your lawn, you may not want to stop there… Pollinator species would certainly benefit from more people turning their lawns into the wild grassland habitat that’s so rare in the British landscape today. But a single square metre of grassland might only absorb about 2-5g of CO₂ over the course of a year. So how helpful is rewilding your garden for slowing climate change? Very helpful, if you add a pond, says Associate Professor of Ecology at Northumbria University, Mike Jeffries.  


      Read more:
      Ponds can absorb more carbon than woodland – here's how they can fight climate change in your garden


 A pond that’s only a square metre in size could suck as much as 247g of carbon from the air every year. Though small ponds make up a tiny proportion of the UK’s land area – about 0.0006% of it – they punch well above their weight in terms of how much carbon they can bury as sediment. By digging a pond in your garden, you’d also be inviting some truly unique wildlife. Perhaps most interesting of all according to Jeffries is the tadpole shrimp – thought to be the oldest animal in the world. Garden ponds can also draw in more familiar creatures, like frogs and toads. Half of all the UK’s ponds were lost during the 20th century, leaving many native amphibians searching for somewhere to live. As climate change threatens to dry up much of these habitats, garden ponds could provide an oasis for struggling species says Becky Thomas, a Senior Teaching Fellow in Ecology at Royal Holloway University. Frogs and toads need clean ponds in which to breed [but] the fashion of keeping our gardens meticulously neat and tidy is leaving our wildlife with nowhere to hide. Creating a pond can be a fun project – especially with children. Once put in, it will only take a matter of days before something decides to make it their home. It will usually be invertebrates and plants to begin with, but it won’t take long for it to be found by a nearby frog or toad population.

 No matter where you look, you’re likely to find a potentially useful habitat for nature that’s under threat. Professors of Conservation Ecology Brendan Wintle (University of Melbourne) and Sarah Bekessy (RMIT University) say that even very small patches can be invaluable for a particular species.  It may not look like a pristine expanse of Amazon rainforest or an African savannah, but the patch of bush at the end of the street could be one of the only places on the planet that harbour a particular species of endangered animal or plant. In Australia, our cities are home to, on average, three times as many threatened species per unit area as rural environments. This means urbanisation is one of the most destructive processes for biodiversity.

      The small patch of bush over your back fence might be key to a species’ survival


 Moving out of gardens and into the streets, how could our towns and cities be reimagined with more space for nature? Heather Alberro, a PhD Candidate in Political Ecology at Nottingham Trent University, believes that “urban greening” could make the places we live resilient to climate change and ensure a refuge for biodiversity: Cool those heat waves: a single tree can have the cooling effect of more than ten air conditioning units, all while absorbing carbon. Higher temperatures turn cities into concrete heat traps, but using air conditioning to stay cool takes a lot of electricity, adding more CO₂ to the atmosphere. By contrast, trees shade surfaces that might otherwise absorb heat and cool the air by gathering water on their leaves which evaporates in the sun. Filter air pollution: plants capture airborne particulates in the wax or cuticles of their leaves. By filling streets with trees, the air can be made safer to breathe. Increase biodiversity: rooftop gardens and forested terraces can create habitats in new places. Networks of connected habitats – such as wildflower meadows that snake along roadsides – could allow new urban ecosystems to form, populated by species that had previously been squeezed out of the concrete sprawl.

      Urban greening can save species, cool warming cities, and make us happy


 If all that sounds good to you then you’re in luck, Alberro says. Urban greening is being taken very seriously by architects, designers and politicians. You may find your neighbourhood growing wilder in the years to come. The mass greening and rewilding of our cities is no novel or abstract ideal. It is already happening in many urban spaces around the world. The mayor of Paris has ambitious plans to “green” 100 hectares of the city by 2020. London mayor Sadiq Khan hopes to make London the world’s first “National Park City” through mass tree planting and park restoration, greening more than half of the capital by 2050. If you live outside a major city then perhaps it’s your daily commute that will change first. Thanks to efforts by campaigners and local councils in the UK, roadside verges are being turned into wildflower meadows, with an eight-mile “river of flowers” now hugging a motorway in Rotherham. According to Olivia Norfolk – a Lecturer in Conservation Ecology at Anglia Ruskin University – bees and butterflies don’t seem to mind the traffic and their numbers have “increased dramatically” where regular mowing has stopped and wildflower meadows have returned on grass verges. She said: The UK road network spans over 246,000 miles – reducing mowing on the grass verges that surround them to just once a year could save money and create thriving habitats for pollinating insects that return on their own each spring.

      Roadside wildflower meadows are springing up across the UK – and they're helping wildlife in a big way


 Seeing so much colour on land that was once devoid of life can really lift the spirits. Alberro believes this may be the greatest benefit from rewilding – more human happiness. The Japanese call it Shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing” – the idea that regular immersion in nature is as good as therapy. In the future, people may not have to go too far to get their fix.

"Bioenergy and biofuels have an important role to play in lowering the use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels – a point underscored by the IPCC report which confirmed the need for further research to improve such technology. A key challenge is creating alternative transport fuels, which are currently overwhelmingly fossil-fuel dependent, and responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. Of the renewable energy alternatives such as wind, tidal and solar power, it is only non-edible biomass (broadly, any biological matter derived from plants or other organisms) that can offer a low-cost, “drop-in” sustainable transport fuel. Such a liquid biofuel with a high energy density would fit easily into the enormous global fuel distribution networks that already exist. Other renewables such as wind and solar, though well-suited to powering static homes and industry, would require significant breakthroughs in battery technology before they could compete with gasoline, diesel or liquid biofuels. With transport and emissions growing, an alternative is needed, fast. Biofuels derived from waste could replace 16%, or 37m tonnes, of oil used by road vehicles in the EU alone by 2030. But history has shown how introducing new and transformative technologies can be slow, especially when they seek to usurp the highly-embedded infrastructure of the status quo.  Each year India produces more than 200m tonnes of inedible agricultural waste such as rice and cotton stalks, unsuitable for either human consumption, animal fodder or bedding. Most is burned illegally to speed up the process of crop rotation. This releases huge quantities carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and wastes valuable hydrocarbons that could be put to use. Europe produces 900m tonnes of agricultural, forestry and food waste – all are rich in energy-filled sugars.  Which waste stream is used as a raw material feedstock for biofuels will differ from region to region, so a key challenge is to develop the technology that can process biomass with very diverse physical and chemical properties. For example, pine bark, switchgrass, corn husks, and starches. Putting this to use would bring substantial benefits to industry and the economy: instead of paying to burn and bury biomass waste, companies could sell it as the starting point of creating valuable gasoline, diesel and jet fuels. At the European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI) we are working on the engineering necessary. Solutions include thermochemical conversion, for distributed power generation such as to small farms and telecommunications towers. Thermochemical processes, such as pyrolysis, use heat (rather than burning) to force a chemical reaction. This can be dramatically accelerated and steered by the use of catalysts to lower the barriers to chemical bond breaking. At high temperatures, the chemical bonds between carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms in biomass break. The products include a solid, called biochar (like charcoal, but not derived from coal), which is used as a soil enhancer or a solid heating fuel. It also produces a liquid that can be used as a biodiesel to power combustion engines, and a small amount of biogas that can be burned to sustain the pyrolysis heat reaction, introducing a degree of self-sufficiency that reduces the overall cost of the process. Similar approaches pursued by private and state-funded businesses worldwide could deliver a double whammy of eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from burning waste and at the same time yielding high energy density fuels. British Airways has this month committed to buy 50,000 tonnes of aircraft jet fuel derived from biowaste to be manufactured at a plant in Thurrock, Essex, as part of its deal with sustainable fuel company Solena. And one of the biggest champions of biofuels is the US military, currently offering US$4 billion in loans to companies able to help commercialise and push forward the technology required. It’s important to end society’s dependence on the use of non-renewable, carbon-based fuels. But this cannot be done at the expense of food crops (using corn to create ethanol, for example) or land used for food crops, as was the case with so-called first generation biofuels. The pressure this has put on food security in some parts of the world has blackened biofuels’ reputation. But it’s crucial not to throw the baby out with the bathwater: the IPCC report urges us to explore the potential of all alternative energy sources. Newer, second generation biofuels can use non-edible plants (such as grasses) that can grow on soils that cannot sustain food crops. Better yet, careful selection and processing of waste biomass can accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels – we cannot simply write off biofuels as a credible solution to the world’s future energy needs, as it has been by some. Bioenergy solutions are more practical, economic and immediate than many alternatives. The authors of the IPCC report are absolutely right to highlight the urgent need to alter policy and investment strategies. Funding agencies, private industry and NGOs must work together to focus research and development efforts in bioenergy, and identify projects that will deliver rapid change, without compromising environmental and farming needs. The clock is ticking."

Fig. 1. Monthly global atmospheric CO2 (NOOA; green), monthly global sea surface temperature (HadSST2; blue stippled) and monthly global surface air temperature (HadCRUT3; red), since January 1980. Last month shown is December 2011.Reposted from the Hockey Schtick, as I’m out of time and on the road.- Anthony
An important new paper published today in Global and Planetary Change finds that changes in CO2 follow rather than lead global air surface temperature and that “CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2” The paper finds the “overall global temperature change sequence of events appears to be from 1) the ocean surface to 2) the land surface to 3) the lower troposphere,” in other words, the opposite of claims by global warming alarmists that CO2 in the atmosphere drives land and ocean temperatures. Instead, just as in the ice cores, CO2 levels are found to be a lagging effect ocean warming, not significantly related to man-made emissions, and not the driver of warming. Prior research has shown infrared radiation from greenhouse gases is incapable of warming the oceans, only shortwave radiation from the Sun is capable of penetrating and heating the oceans and thereby driving global surface temperatures.
The highlights of the paper are: 
► The overall global temperature change sequence of events appears to be from 1) the ocean surface to 2) the land surface to 3) the lower troposphere.
► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature.
► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature.
► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature.
► Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980.
► CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2, and changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.

Abstract
Using data series on atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temperatures we investigate the phase relation (leads/lags) between these for the period January 1980 to December 2011. Ice cores show atmospheric CO2 variations to lag behind atmospheric temperature changes on a century to millennium scale, but modern temperature is expected to lag changes in atmospheric CO2, as the atmospheric temperature increase since about 1975 generally is assumed to be caused by the modern increase in CO2. In our analysis we use eight well-known datasets; 1) globally averaged well-mixed marine boundary layer CO2 data, 2) HadCRUT3 surface air temperature data, 3) GISS surface air temperature data, 4) NCDC surface air temperature data, 5) HadSST2 sea surface data, 6) UAH lower troposphere temperature data series, 7) CDIAC data on release of anthropogene CO2, and 8) GWP data on volcanic eruptions. Annual cycles are present in all datasets except 7) and 8), and to remove the influence of these we analyze 12-month averaged data. We find a high degree of co-variation between all data series except 7) and 8), but with changes in CO2 always lagging changes in temperature. The maximum positive correlation between CO2 and temperature is found for CO2 lagging 11–12 months in relation to global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months to global surface air temperature, and about 9 months to global lower troposphere temperature. The correlation between changes in ocean temperatures and atmospheric CO2 is high, but do not explain all observed changes.

GlandÅµr Cymru, which looks after the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, said more people have been taking time out and ""discovering our waterways"".
The canal network stretches 33miles (55km) from Brecon to Newport, and was used to carry coal, lime and iron ore.
Three new lock gates will replace ones that have been there for 20 years.
It has ""never been more important"" to keep the waterways open and available, according to the director of the waterway charity, Mark Evans.
""This year we're spending almost Â£1m on our winter works programme in Wales,"" added Mr Evans.
""These vital repairs, replacements and refurbishments take on a greater significance this year as many people have discovered our waterways, exercising on the towpaths during lockdown and taking staycation hire boat holidays.
""Set against the challenges of the pandemic, and with research showing that being by the water improves wellbeing, it has never been more important to keep the waterways open and available.""
The new lock gates at a section near Llangynidr in Powys, will stand at up to 5.2m tall (17ft), each weigh as much as a small elephant and 5.4 tonnes in total.
Work began at Lock 64 with a specialist fish rescue to temporarily relocate resident tench, pike and bream in the canal.
It meant draining the the lock and a 450m (1,500ft) stretch of the canal, before the task of removing the old gates could begin, and the hand-crafted replacements made from sustainably grown green oak are installed.
Replacing lock gates is a key part of GlandÅµr Cymru's winter programme of works ""ensuring that the 200-year old canal is boat-ready and boater-friendly"".
It is hoped the work will be completed before Christmas."
"Do we have enough onshore windfarms, or do we have too many? And who decides what “too many” looks like? The Conservative Party has announced it would end subsidies for new onshore wind farms if it won the next election, and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has demonstrated an aggressive approach that has seen two thirds of planning applications for onshore wind farms rejected in the last year – 164 projects halted since January.  For example, under the ministerial power to call in a planning decision, Pickles rejected the plan proposed jointly by Wind Prospect and EDF for a six turbine, 12MW wind farm near Bridlington, Yorkshire – one of ten onshore wind farms rejected by call-in over the past year – in doing so overturning the decision of a planning inspector. Is this war on windfarms wise? Tory peer Lord Deben was reported as saying the UK had “enough” onshore wind projects, and that though they will continue to be important after 2020, “it is not a decision we need to make now”. The Committee on Climate Change which he chairs reiterated that increasing onshore wind capacity during the 2020s was likely to be the most cost-effective means for the UK to meet its carbon emissions targets. According to the committee, while there is sufficient capacity online and in the pipeline to meet 2020 targets, this relies on there being sufficient investment in other renewable technologies. Beyond 2020, there will be choices to be made on how to decarbonise Britain’s energy generation system. The most cost-effective method entails more onshore wind development through the 2020s; doing anything else faces raising costs with knock-on effects on energy prices and affordability. Clearly the actual outcome will depend a lot on politics. Trade association Renewable UK stated, rather bitterly, that it is “unfortunate that we’ve reached a point where the Conservatives are allowing UKIP to dictate Tory energy policy”, calling Tory efforts to mollify the party’s rural electoral heartlands ahead of next year’s election “ill-considered, short-term policy-making on the hoof” and likely to damage what is becoming a flagship British industry. According to the Committee on Climate Change, the most cost-effective means to hit the emissions reductions targets for 2020 is 15GW of onshore wind up and running by then, rising to 25GW by 2030 – on the basis that it is “relatively low cost”. But if not that, then what? The UK already has around 10GW of wind capacity on and offshore, which according to National Grid needs to more than double to 26GW by 2020. If onshore wind projects, the far easier and cheaper of the two, are to be slowed or even halted, the task becomes considerably more difficult.  It will be made even harder still if the government persist with its plan to halt funding for large solar farms. That’s another technology Pickles has targeted, although his rejection of one in Suffolk has been overturned by judicial review. Given policies like this, David Toke at Aberdeen University suggests that the UK will fall far short of its target for 15% energy generated from renewables by 2020 agreed with the EU.  This has all come about despite public support for onshore wind farms in the UK remaining high. In the last survey conducted by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, 70% were in favour. Public support for solar was even higher – 85%. Yet for specific projects objections are raised about intrusion and, more prosaically,in the case of wind farms, their possible impact on house prices. Another issue for wind is noise, and in particular infrasound. While audible noise even at very low levels can be annoying, which means the exact location of a wind farm is key, the claim that significant heath problems arise from ultrasound seems to have been roundly disproved.  Among critics, much is made of the problems stemming from over-reliance on wind and solar, which by their nature are intermittent, depending on the weather. However, in the case of wind, a Royal Academy of Engineering study concluded there would be no major problems integrating intermittent energy from wind into the grid until it contributed more than 20% of the national demand. Once major contributions from offshore wind and other renewables, including solar, pushed their contribution beyond 20%, new grid balancing strategies will be needed, but there are plenty of options. It’s not technology that’s the problem. While there are disagreements on the role of nuclear power, the relative merits of renewables and the subsidies they both require, all agree that onshore wind is the cheapest non-fossil fuel energy source. The question is whether nimbyish responses to the changing face of energy generation are allowed to overshadow what agreement there is."
"Perched at almost 8,500 metres on Everest, we paced back-and-forth, attempting to stave off frostbite as temperatures hovered close to -30°C and our drill batteries became too cold to work. Our ambition to install the highest automatic weather station in history looked destined for failure. We were at the end of an almost two-month expedition, led by National Geographic, to conduct a hugely ambitious scientific survey of the 8,848-metre Mount Everest. I am a climate scientist who specialises in extreme environments, and together with Baker Perry (a geographer at Appalachian State University), I was trying to install the highest weather station in the world. Weeks of sickness had plagued the expedition (from diarrhoea to full-on Influenza-A), but we had so far succeeded. Four stations were under our belt, including at Everest Basecamp (5,315 metres), and Camp II (6,464 metres) – perched high above the infamous Khumbu Icefall. The day before we had celebrated installing the highest operating weather station in the world, near Camp IV at almost 8,000 metres. Only one team of Italian scientists had deployed equipment this high before. Any celebrations, however, were short-lived. We filled the rest of that day eating, melting snow and sleeping, squeezing in about two hours of sleep before climbing out of Camp IV as midnight approached. We were determined to get our final station as close to the summit as possible, capturing the first continuous measurements of the weather in the thin air of the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. Such data increases our understanding of the climates possible on Earth. Were we going to find the strongest near-surface winds on the planet? Just how cold and oxygen deprived is it up there during a winter storm? Could a human theoretically survive these conditions? Beyond this frontier meteorology and insight into life at the extremes, the station data could help improve weather forecasts on the mountain, hopefully making Everest climbers less susceptible to deadly surprises from extreme events. Led by a superhuman Sherpa team from the nearby village of Phortse – carrying the disassembled weather station, other science equipment and the normal climbing paraphernalia – we made good progress from Camp IV, climbing faster than we had all expedition. The atmosphere, however, was tense. Above 8,000 metres there is little room for failure, and the 2019 Spring climbing season provided too many reminders of our vulnerability. Unfavourable weather concentrated a record number of climbers into just a few days for summit attempts, making parts of the mountain unusually crowded. Tragically, many more climbers than normal would never make it back down alive.

      Everest: 11 climbers dead in 16 days – how should we deal with the bodies on the mountain?


 These crowds also impacted our expedition. After around three hours of good progress towards the summit, we hit the back of a queue of climbers all clipped to the rope above. Our pace was cut by more than half. Hands and feet began to cool. The fear of frostbite grew. After hours more of shuffling, collective frustration was palpable. Our lead Sherpa (Panuru) – a charismatic veteran of 14 successful Everest summit – declared that we must reassess our options. So it was there, at Everest’s “Balcony” (8,430 metres), that we peeled off from the back of the pack and found a spot for the weather station.  Continuing any higher would have been a dangerous gamble against the odds. Ours was not a typical climbing expedition: we needed to perform hours of work on the summit and, given the slow progress, it was extremely unlikely our oxygen supplies would have lasted the round trip. Our Sherpa team leapt into action at the Balcony. They had trained with us over the past two months for this very moment. For Baker and I this represented the climax of almost eight months’ preparation. We were desperate when the drill (that was needed to help bolt the station to the rock) refused to be coaxed to life. It was only with the sustained body heat from our warmest Sherpa that the batteries eventually warmed enough for the drilling and installation to commence. The Sherpa were immense: a lifetime spent at high altitude meant they were quicker witted in the low oxygen environment, stronger, with hands more tolerant of the cold. It was thanks to their efforts that we successfully broke new ground with the installation of this weather station – nearly half a vertical kilometre higher than anything that had gone before. Now safely back at sea-level, Baker and I have been watching the near-real time, satellite-streamed weather data with interest. We have already seen winds near Camp IV equivalent to a category 2 hurricane – and this is the period normally known for its settled weather. These stations owe their severe winds to the subtropical jetstream – a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air which influences weather across large swathes of the Northern Hemisphere. Placing a weather station at such height means scientists can now monitor the jet directly and learn more about it. And the fact it is on the relatively well-trodden Mount Everest means passing climbers and Sherpas may be able to help with maintenance. If the new weather stations can survive the extreme conditions long enough, we hope that they will also give us a more complete picture of the high-altitude Himalayan climate, including how it may be changing. This is urgent because it is here that glaciers – the source of freshwater to hundreds of millions of people – are retreating, and as we improve our understanding of the climate, we increase our ability to outline the changes (and challenges) that may be ahead. There is of course much to do, with far more monitoring needed to understand the spatial diversity in climate and its rate of change across the Earth’s mountains. It is difficult and risky to install weather stations in high-altitude locations, but the stakes are now very high. As scientists we must therefore accept the challenge and continue venturing upward."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Like too many other long‐​reigning fixtures on Capitol Hill, Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) doesn’t appreciate the magnitude of the challenge to the authority he presumes to hold over America’s job and wealth creators. Or maybe he does, and frustration over that fact explains why he besmirches companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard.   
  
  
Levin presided over a Senate hearing last week devoted to examining the “loopholes and gimmicks” used by these multinational companies to avoid paying taxes – and to branding them dirty tax scofflaws. Well here’s a news flash for the senator: incentives matter.   
  
  
The byzantine U.S. tax code, which Senator Levin – over his 33‐​year tenure in the U.S. Senate (one‐​third of a century!) – no doubt had a hand or two in shaping, includes the highest corporate income tax rate among all of the world’s industrialized countries and the unusual requirement that profits earned abroad by U.S. multinationals are subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation. No other major economy does that. Who in their right minds would not expect those incentives to encourage moving production off shore and keeping profits there?   
  
  
Minimizing exposure to taxes – like avoiding an oncoming truck – is a natural reaction to tax policy. Entire software and accounting industries exist to serve that specific objective. Unless they are illegal (and that is not what Levin asserts directly), the tax minimization programs employed at Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard are legitimate responses to the tax policies implemented and foreshadowed by this and previous congresses. If Levin is concerned about diminishing federal tax collections from corporations (which, of course, reduces his power), the solution is to change the incentives – to change the convoluted artifice of backroom politics that is our present tax code.   
  
  
Combine the current tax incentive structure with stifling, redundant environmental, financial, and health and safety regulations, an out‐​of‐​control tort system that often starts with a presumption of corporate malfeasance, exploding health care costs, and costly worker’s compensation rules, and it becomes apparent why more and more businesses would consider moving operations abroad – permanently. Thanks to the progressive trends of globalization, liberalization, transportation, and communication, societies’ producers are no longer quite as captive to confiscatory or otherwise suffocating domestic policies. They have choices.   
  
  
Of course many choose to stay, and for good reason. We are fortunate to have the institutions, the rule of law, deep and diversified capital markets, excellent research universities, a highly‐​skilled workforce, cultural diversity, and a society that not only tolerates but encourages dissent, and the world’s largest consumer market – still. Success is more likely to be achieved in an environment with those advantages. They are the ingredients of our ingenuity, our innovativeness, our willingness to take risks as entrepreneurs, and our economic success. This is why companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Hewlett‐​Packard are born in the United States.   
  
  
But those advantages are eroding.   
  
  
While U.S. policymakers browbeat U.S. companies and threaten them with sanctions for “shipping jobs overseas” or “hiding profits abroad” or some other manifestation of what politicians like to call corporate greed, characterizing them as a scourge to be contained and controlled, other governments are hungry for the benefits those companies can provide their people. Some of those governments seem to recognize that the world’s wealth and jobs creators have choices about where they produce, sell, and conduct research and development. And some are acting to attract U.S. businesses with incentives that become less necessary every time a politician vents his spleen about evil corporations. Not only should our wealth creators be treated with greater respect from Washington, but we are kidding ourselves if we think our policies don’t need to keep up. As I wrote in a December 2009 Cato paper: 



Governments are competing for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative friction.



This global competition in policy is a positive development. But U.S. policymakers cannot take for granted that traditional U.S. strengths will be enough. We have to compete and earn our share with good policies. The decisions made now with respect to policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.   
  
  
Since another hearing devoted to thanking these companies for their contriubtions to the U.S. economy is unlikely, perhaps Senator Levin should at least consider the perils of chasing away these golden geese.

Burma’s agony continues. On Sunday the military dictatorship held a rigged election to cloak itself in civilian garb. The people of Burma will continue to suffer under one of the worst governments on earth.



Gen. Ne Win seized power in 1962. Nearly a half century later the country is ruled by a junta headed by Gen. Than Shwe. The military’s crimes are many. It has imposed a corrupt and brutal dictatorship; conducted a genocidal war against dissident ethnic groups; suppressed civil and political liberties; kept the country desperately poor; and enriched well‐​connected allies at public expense. The government even impeded international assistance after devastating Cyclone Nargis in 2008. 



The regime has repeatedly attempted to rebrand itself. For instance, the junta once called itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, but shifted to the State Peace and Development Council. Alas, the only peace the SPDC believes in is of the grave and the only development it supports is of junta members’ bank accounts. The generals occasionally ousted and imprisoned each other. 



In 1990 the junta foolishly held an election. Like the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and Polish Communists, who also called free ballots, the Burmese military overestimated its popular support. The Burmese people decisively rejected the regime, overwhelmingly voting for Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. So the generals voided the result, suppressed the NLD, and quarantined Suu Kyi, subjecting her to house arrest for 15 of the last 21 years.



There has been no mellowing over the years. In 2003 the regime promised a “roadmap to discipline‐​flourishing democracy,” which emphasized discipline over democracy. The SPDC ruthlessly suppressed protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007. The following year the junta stuffed ballot boxes in a referendum on its authoritarian constitution, drafted without popular input. The generals routinely harassed Suu Kyi and sentenced many of her supporters to long prison terms. The regime reached ceasefire agreements with a number of rebellious ethnic groups, but since then has begun demanding that the forces disarm, a nonstarter for people who have suffered from unlimited military barbarity for decades.



The junta’s latest strategy is another election, for a two‐​house national parliament and 14 state and regional assemblies. However, this ballot was rigged from the start to prevent any chance of the opposition triumphing. First, there was no independent election commission and no foreign observers were allowed. No electioneering, let along criticism of the government was permitted. The media is largely controlled by the government; even nominally private publications are censored. So are sermons by monks. The cost of registering to run alone exceeded the per capita GDP. Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, complained: the vote was “being conducted in a climate of fear, intimidation, and resignation.”



Second, some 2000 imprisoned democracy activists, including Suu Kyi and many other NLD members, were deemed ineligible to run. Political parties were required to expel members with “criminal” records, including for political offenses, to contest the ballot.



Thus, the NLD, the nation’s only legitimate governing force, refused to participate. The generals then dissolved the party (along with nine others). NLD activists responded by urging a boycott. The regime threatened to jail them while promising development projects to neighborhoods where residents marked their ballots ahead of time. The government also barred people from participating in many eastern ethnic areas, while in others rebellious groups refused to participate. 



Third, the regime turned military apparatchiks into civilian candidates. Through the misnamed United Solidarity and Development Party the generals fielded candidates to contest all 1,163 offices at stake. The equally misnamed National Unity Party, representing Ne Win, the original dictator who was ousted in 1988, put up 999 candidates. Richard Horsey, a former UN official, contended that victories by some of the latter would demonstrate that the military is not monolithic, but the NUP no more represents the Burmese people does than the USDP. Both military factions are paranoid, xenophobic, and despotic.



In contrast, the National Democratic Force, a rump group of former NLD‐​activists, only contested 163 seats. A number of other small parties, including several ethnic‐​based organizations, ran a few candidates. A number of independents also stood for office. Still, Burma’s foreign minister, Nyan Win, claimed: “Such a large participation made it crystal clear that the elections become virtually inclusive.”



Fourth, parties were required to affirm support for the 2008 constitution imposed by the SPDC. That document reserves one‐​fourth of the lower house and one‐​third of the upper house to the military, allows the “civilian” president to turn power over to the military, creates a National Defense and Security Council, and permits the military‐​controlled Union Election Commission to dismiss legislators for “misbehavior.”



Authority will not be transferred. The generals will remain in charge. The Burmese people are not fooled. Ashin Issariya, a founding member of the All Burma Monks Alliance, observed: “It will be the same faces and the same system that we have been living with for decades. The name ‘elections’ does not change anything for us.” Long‐​time NLD activist Win Tin said the election “will just help the military get what they want — to rule for a century or more.” Dot Lay Mu of the Karen National Union warned: the generals are using the poll to “consolidate and prolong” their control.



The junta’s objective is another image makeover. Today the SPDC is widely reviled around the world and subject to U.S. and European sanctions. The generals hope to gain greater international acceptance.



The international response to the junta has been divided. The U.S. and Europe have campaigned against the regime, but Burma’s neighbors have refused to join in. China supports the generals irrespective of how many people they kill. India is economically active in Burma and, along with Malaysia and Singapore, trains SPDC military officers. Other countries, including Thailand, have refused to do more than apply limited pressure, valuing Burma’s natural resources more than Burmese human rights.



Now Asian governments are lauding the poll while Western governments are unsure how to respond. Some analysts argue that even a flawed election presages possible political liberalization. 



Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson of MIT and Harvard, respectively, wrote: “History shows that gradual, half‐​hearted reforms of this sort are exactly how many autocracies successfully transition to democracy.” However, the examples they cite are less than convincing. Great Britain and early America were republics which distrusted direct democracy, not dictatorships. Chile immunized participants in the military regime, but returned power to an elected civilian government. Taiwan allowed the established though previously outlawed opposition party to contest newly free elections. Burma matches none of these. Egypt may be closer, but that nation remains unfree a half century after Col. Abdul Nasser became a civilian. 



Allowing a genuinely free vote for a civilian government with some independent powers even while the military maintains control over security agencies might permit a gradual evolution to a more liberal system. But allowing a few dissident civilians to assume powerless positions in a system controlled by the same authoritarian apparatchiks, only wearing suits rather than uniforms, is unlikely to yield any noticeable difference in governance. 



Some analysts posit that the process may empower younger military men. Younger does not necessarily mean reformer, however. Observed journalist Bertil Lintner, “Lower and middle‐​ranking army officers remain immensely loyal to the leadership, knowing full well that they can only rise to prominent and privileged positions by showing that they are even more hardline than their superiors.” Anyway, the aging process guarantees personnel turnover. The faux elections add nothing. So too when it comes to dreams of economic liberalization and government transparency: such policies will change only if the military wants them to change, not as a result of the vote.



If Suu Kyi is released after her house arrest formally expires on November 13 — and she is allowed to resume active political activities, along with other democratic activists — then there might be at least a little hope for a little change. But if most of those who have been fighting for liberty remain imprisoned, opposition political activity remains proscribed, and criticism of the government remains prohibited, then even Suu Kyi’s release, though welcome, would signal no change.



Still, Lex Rieffel and David I. Steinberg, of the Brookings Institution and Georgetown University respectively, argued that “With smart, nuanced policies, however, the U.S. and other Western countries could help to ensure that the November election is a major step toward a democratic and prosperous Burma.” What policies they do not say. Since the ballot changes nothing substantive, it is hard to imagine policies which could to turn the vote into a positive step forward.



The fact that the faux election offers no prospect of change doesn’t mean the West should maintain its policy of isolation and sanctions. This strategy has manifestly failed. Today’s only winner is China, which has achieved disproportionate influence in Rangoon.



Attempting to reinforce isolation and sanctions is a dead‐​end. For instance, the administration is now pushing for a UN‐​sponsored commission to investigate Burma for war crimes. It’s a fine idea, but one that will never get past Beijing in the Security Council. Given the prevalence of human rights abusers in the international body, General Assembly or Human Rights Council vote is no more likely.



It is time to move in the opposite direction.



Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the ballot “will be without international legitimacy” but called for “dialogue” as “the best way forward” among difficult options. He hopes for the rise of new players and structures, but that’s more dream than reality. The poll alone is no reason by itself to reverse policy. The U.S. should not aid the junta’s attempt to disguise its malign character. Brutal authoritarians were in control on November 6, before the vote. Brutal authoritarians remain in control on November 8, after the vote.



After a decent interval, however, Washington should consult with Europeans and leading Asian states to forge a united strategy to press Burma for reform. The U.S. government needs to recognize that its ability to influence events in Rangoon is limited. Broader international support, especially in Southeast Asia, is required for any hope of progress. 



No policy offers much likelihood of success. But promising to eschew attempts at coercive regime change while offering rewards for political liberalization may provide the best, if still not a good, strategy to promote real change. For instance, Jared Genser of Freedom Now argued: “It is only through a facilitated process of tripartite dialogue among the junta, Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy and the country’s disparate ethnic groups that any real reconciliation and progress toward democracy will be made.”



Burma poses one of the world’s greatest humanitarian challenges. The latest “election” changes nothing. The Obama administration should treat the new “civilian” government no different than the old military regime. But Washington nevertheless should acknowledge the failure of its past democratization efforts, and look for a new way forward.

"Victoria is experiencing an increasing number of megafires that are threatening some of the state’s most important ecological habitats, a new study in a leading international journal has found. Many areas had seen multiple bushfires since 1995 at a frequency that was much too high to allow forests time to recover, risking the beginning of ecosystem collapse, the research said.  Areas worst hit by bushfires were native forests used for logging, the research found, with 63% of those areas burned since 1995. Lead author Prof David Lindenmayer, of the Australian National University’s Fenner school of environment and society, said global heating was increasing the risk of fires and logging was making forests more flammable. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research analysed in detail areas burned each year from 1995 to last summer’s fire season. In late 2019 and early 2020, about 1.5m hectares of Victorian forests burned – the largest area since 1939, when 3.4m hectares were hit. Across the state’s most important areas for forest-dependent threatened species, the analysis found 57% had burned in the most recent fires. From 1950 to 2002, Victoria had not experienced a year when fire had burned through more than 600,000 hectares. But since 2003, there had been three “megafire” years when more than 1m hectares of forest had burned. Lindenmayer told Guardian Australia: “We should not expect that the last fire season will be unusual. “A megafire is a fire that’s more than 1m hectares, and we’ve had three since 2003 – a megafire every six years. We will probably have another, or possibly two, before the end of this decade.” Lindenmayer said of the 1.5m hectares burned in the most recent fire season, more than 600,000 hectares had burned twice in the past 25 years, and more than 112,000 hectares had burned three times. “Some significant parts of the landscape are burning three or four times in 25 years. The forest can’t cope with that much fire or produce viable seed and it can collapse into something else.” Some 44% of protected areas had burned from 1995 to present, the study found, compared with 63% of native forests used for logging. “That’s a significant difference,” Lindenmayer said. “State forests are burning significantly more than national parks. “The number of fires is also significantly greater in state forests than national parks. That’s happening because the data is showing that for many forest types, logging makes them more prone to fire and higher severity fires. The area statistics show this quite strikingly. “We have this substantial area of native forests that’s purposed for logging, but it’s burning incredibly frequently and that undermines the ability of the industry to keep working its resource. Fire is competing with logging for the resource.” Biomass was left behind during logging operations, and younger regrowth trees also tended to dry out forest areas and create dense zones that were more prone to fire, causing impacts that lasted decades, Lindemayer said. In new and unpublished analysis, Lindenmayer said Victoria had lost 77% of its old growth forests in the past 25 years – “and old growth forests are where biodiversity is the highest”. He said one ecosystem type that included the commercially-harvested mountain ash was burning too frequently to allow it to regenerate. Mountain ash was traditionally harvested when it reached about 80 years old, but Lindenmayer said the chances of the trees reaching that age was down to only one in five. “In some places the return interval [for bushfire] is five to six years where it should be 75 to 150 years,” he said. “We have some serious issues to deal with – there’s the climate and land management – as well as the interaction between the two. “We are going to lose important areas of forest but we will make some parts of rural and regional Australia incredibly dangerous to live in. “Old growth forests is where biodiversity is the highest. From any perspective Victoria is a train wreck, but New South Wales is also heavily damaged. “The answer is that we have to get our timber from plantations,” he said. The study said: “The large amount of native forest in Victoria dedicated to logging that is now burnt means that native forest-dependent logging industries will no longer be sustainable or economically and ecologically tenable.” A spokesman for the state-owned forest company VicForests said: “Many academics and fire experts agree that harvesting does not elevate fire risk. “We work with partner agencies and use scientific research to develop a harvest program that protects the environment and mitigates the impacts of bushfires. “VicForests is committed to the sustainable management of forest areas allocated to it for harvesting. We take great care to protect potential habitat and high conservation values, especially following fire.” He said VicForests’ “ecologically sensitive approach” was supporting families, communities and townships that were impacted by the fires. In a seperate study in the journal Fire, scientists at the University of Tasmania examined the fires in Tasmania’s southern Huon Valley in early 2019. The study compared the severity of fires across old-growth, mature and plantation forests, and found that old-growth forests not impacted by logging burned less severely than other areas."
"**A ""lighthouse lab"" with the capacity to process 50,000 coronavirus tests every day has opened in the East Midlands.**
The laboratory in Loughborough, Leicestershire, will receive samples from drive-through centres, social care and home kits.
PerkinElmer has been chosen by the government to run the facility, which is the sixth of its kind to open.
Hopes of a coronavirus vaccine mean it is only contracted until the end of March.
Lighthouse laboratories are already operating in Milton Keynes, Cheshire, Glasgow, Cambridge and Newport.
The Loughborough facility is expecting to receive about 3,000 coronavirus test samples on its first day.
Miles Burrows, managing director of PerkinElmer, said this will slowly increase throughout December until it reaches its 50,000 a day projection.
Mr Burrows said the lab represented, ""a significant additional capacity"".
""Essentially, the more capacity in the network, the greater the number of people can be tested and the faster the results will get back to those people,"" he added.
The laboratory will be open 24 hours a day and will employ 430 staff.
Fatima Omar, a biomedical scientist at the site, said the work would be ""challenging"" but interesting.
Mike Sandys, director of public health for Leicestershire County Council, said he welcomed the lab's arrival.
Interim executive chair of the National Institute for Public Health, Baroness Dido Harding said the lab had ""definitely not"" come too late.
She said: ""It's still going to take time for the vaccine to be rolled out.
""In the world of today, we really do need this.""

As a regulatory tool, the precautionary principle has met with mixed reactions. While many variants exist, a generally accepted definition is that activities should not proceed when the threats of damage are not fully understood. A major concern with this principle is that by focusing solely on the risk from one action, it fails to consider the risk from an alternative action. Something abandoned out of precaution is replaced by something else, which may also carry risk. From an economic perspective, the precautionary principle fails to consider the tradeoffs inherent in policy decisions.



We provide a large-scale, empirical evaluation of the tradeoff that came from invoking the precautionary principle using the nuclear power plant shutdowns resulting from the accident at Fukushima, Japan. The accident, which resulted from a tsunami caused by the fourth-largest earthquake in recorded history, led to a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Driven by long-standing concerns over the unknown effects from radiation risk, this rejuvenated the anti-nuclear movement. Within 14 months of the accident, nuclear power production came to a complete halt in Japan.



The decrease in nuclear energy production did not come without a cost: higher electricity prices. To meet electricity demands, the reduction in nuclear energy production was offset by increased importation of fossil fuels, which increased the price of electricity by as much as 38 percent in some regions. These higher electricity prices led to a decrease in electricity consumption, particularly during times of the year that have the greatest heating demand. Given that interior climate control provides protection from extreme weather events, we find that the reduced electricity consumption caused an increase in mortality. Our estimated increase in mortality from higher electricity prices significantly outweighs the mortality from the accident itself, suggesting that the decision to cease nuclear energy production caused more harm than good.



We produce these results using the following strategy. First, we document that the shutdown of nuclear power plants increased electricity prices, with strong variation throughout the country depending on the initial energy mix within a region. For example, regions with almost no nuclear energy before the accident experienced electricity price increases around 10 percent, whereas regions with higher dependence on nuclear experienced price increases up to 40 percent. The highly regulated nature of residential electricity markets in Japan means that supply factors contributed to these price changes, suggesting the price changes are exogenous to consumer demand for electricity. Second, we explore how the price changes affected electricity consumption. For example, we compare electricity consumption in Tokyo in January 2012 to electricity consumption in Tokyo in January 2011. We find that electricity consumption decreased roughly one to two months after price changes occurred. The decreases in electricity consumption are more pronounced during the winter, suggesting there is less protection from the weather during the coldest times of the year.



Third, we explore the consequences from the reduced electricity consumption by estimating how it moderates the temperature-mortality relationship. Similar to previous research, we find that extreme temperatures affect mortality, in particular during very cold temperatures, although the effects from higher temperatures are small given the high rates of air conditioning penetration. We then interact temperature with electricity prices to explore how electricity prices moderate the relationship between temperature and mortality. We find increased mortality effects from extreme cold weather, suggesting the decreased consumption of electricity that resulted from higher electricity prices increased mortality.



To put these estimates in context, we calculate that the higher electricity prices resulted in at least an additional 1,280 deaths during 2011–2014. Since our data only covers the 21 largest cities in Japan, which represents 28 percent of the total population, the total effects for the entire nation are even larger. Meanwhile, the number of deaths due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident is much lower. No deaths have yet to be directly attributable to radiation exposure, although projections estimate a cumulative 130 deaths. An estimated 1,232 deaths occurred as a result of the evacuation after the accident. Therefore, the deaths from the higher electricity prices likely outnumber the deaths from the accident in only four years if we extrapolate our estimates to the entire country, and almost certainly outnumber the deaths over a longer time period given that the higher electricity prices persisted beyond the end of our study. This suggests that ceasing nuclear energy production has contributed to more deaths than the accident itself.

"Planet of the Humans is an environmental documentary that has enraged renewable energy experts and environmentalists, with some calling for its high-profile executive producer, Michael Moore, to apologise. It was released for free less than two weeks ago, and at the time of writing had had close to 5m views on YouTube.  Across its 102 minutes, the film’s producer and narrator, Jeff Gibbs, weaves a disjointed narrative that renewable energy is just as bad as fossil fuels, high-profile environmentalists are corrupted by capitalism and population growth is the great unspoken enemy. “It is truly demoralising how much damage this film has done at a moment when many are ready for deep change,” said the Canadian activist and journalist Naomi Klein. “There are important critiques of an environmentalism that refuses to reckon with unlimited consumption and growth. But this film ain’t it.” Moore has continued to defend the film against a swath of critical articles. Why are so many people so angry? Here are some of the key issues, but this is not even close to being an exhaustive list. Associate Prof Mark Diesendorf, an energy systems and sustainability expert at the University of New South Wales, tells Guardian Australia the film’s commentary on renewable energy is “out-of-date, superficial, simplistic, misleading and very biased”. It criticises renewable energy – particularly solar and wind – in part because you need varying amounts of materials, energy and metals to make them. For anyone who has thought for more than a minute about what it takes to build that solar panel or those wind turbines, it should be no revelation that some materials and energy are needed. There’s no such thing as a free lunch. But the film leaves the viewer thinking there is no net gain from renewable technologies and does not, for example, look at any cradle-to-grave analysis of the technologies it criticises. “The myth that life-cycle energy invested [and carbon emissions] in building renewable energy technologies is comparable with the lifetime energy generation is false,” says Diesendorf. “Solar panels generate the energy required to build themselves in one to two years of operation, depending on the type of panel and location and their lifetime is about 20 years; large wind turbines in three to 12 months, depending on size of turbines and location, and their lifetime is 25 to 30 years.” In the film Gibbs says: “I learned that solar panels don’t last forever either.” You would think most people would know that. Early in the film, Gibbs walks with an environment group protesting a plan to put up 21 wind turbines at Lowell Mountain in Vermont, a row that played out in 2011 (another hint at the age of the film). An unnamed campaigner tells Gibbs the power grid needs to run idle when the wind drops and that this causes a “bigger footprint” than just running the grid off fossil fuels. Gibbs takes the speaker’s word but Diesendorf says this is an old myth disproved by real world examples of power grids running with high penetrations of renewable energy – with and without storage such as batteries and hydro power. The pace of change and development in the renewable energy industry is rapid so a film that wants to inform viewers should be as up-to-date as possible. But the film is riddled with footage, segments and issues that are a decade or so old. Gibbs attends the launch of the Chevy Volt, a car launched 10 years ago. He criticises it because it’s recharged from a power grid in Michigan dominated by coal. Taking a very old example of an electric car operating in one place should not be the basis for forming a judgment about the role of electric cars in 2020, yet the film does. Gibbs tours a “football field-sized” solar installation called the Cedar Street solar array in Lansing, Michigan. An energy boss says to camera that the panels have an efficiency of a “little less than 8%” and that the array could power only about 10 city homes a year. What the film doesn’t say is that the array was installed as a pilot project in 2008. One energy writer to have looked closely at many of the claims in the film is Australian Ketan Joshi who says looking at a solar array from 12 years ago is “an absolute eternity in solar development years”. Diesendorf says panels with an 8% efficiency “were on the market several decades ago” and now most commercial panels have an efficiency above 20%. What’s happened to the cost of solar panels since 2008? Analysts Wood Mackenzie say they fell about 90% between 2010 and 2019. The film spends time looking at biomass energy or, more specifically, one subset of biomass technology that is essentially burning trees and woodchips. Gibbs has been a long-time biomass critic (an old article of his includes a photograph taken while filming footage that appears in the film suggesting that a scene showing clear-felled trees is at least 10 years old). Burning trees for energy is very problematic but there are reasons why under some circumstances it is not as bad as burning fossil fuels from a greenhouse gas perspective. One reason is part of climate change 101. Burning fossil fuels liberates carbon atoms that were removed from the Earth’s active carbon cycle millions of years ago. Burning trees moves CO2 back into the biosphere that was sequestered only in recent decades. To an uninformed viewer, the film might look to be getting some purchase when it shows high-profile environmentalists – namely the author and activist Bill McKibben – supporting burning wood. McKibben founded his 350.org climate group at Middlebury College, and the film has footage of him at an opening of a biomass gasification plant there, saying technology like that should be everywhere. That footage was from 2009 and as McKibben has pointed out since the film was released, he very publicly denounced the idea of burning wood for energy in 2016. The film did not make this clear. McKibben says he heard about the plans for the documentary last year: “I wrote the producer and director to set the record straight, and never heard back from them. That seems like bad journalism, and bad faith.” Gibbs says he did not get McKibben’s communication and even if he had he would not have changed the film. That aside, Diesendorf says the film’s treatment of bioenergy is simplistic because while some methods, such as ethanol from corn, are environmentally damaging, ethanol from waste starch is not. He says the film creates a false impression that bioenergy as expected to have a large contribution to energy needs in the future. “The truth is that some see it playing a minor role while almost all the others reject it entirely. Hardly anyone sees it as playing an important role.” Planet of the Humans is a film that is almost entirely devoid of solutions to the existential crisis that its producers say they are deeply concerned about. It rightly raises questions about rampant consumption and the planet’s dwindling ecosystems. As some of the examples also show, the film is long out-of-date and there’s no evidence that attempts were made to revise its content or its premise as new information became available and, presumably, the film sat idle in multiple parts for many years. Gibbs, Moore and fellow producer Ozzie Zehner, who is featured prominently, have defended the documentary. Gibbs says they had “gone to great lengths” to talk to wind and solar experts. “We need our environmental leaders, but we are in the wrong story,” he says in an interview with the Hill. “We are asking questions about what we say is going to save the world, and it should be permitted to have discussions among people who believe in climate change – and know the environment is in trouble – about what’s going to work and what’s not going to work. “That was our intent – to trigger a discussion and raise a lot of questions, but we don’t have all the answers.” Moore adds: “We wanted to ignite a discussion, and that’s happened.” He’s certainly right about that."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.

After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"Damien Chazelle, the writer and director of the musical “La La Land,” never had any doubts about Los Angeles as an artistic canvas. From the film’s opening, with commuters dancing and singing on a congested freeway exit ramp, to the visually stunning final sequence, the city is depicted as a place where dreamers may struggle but where optimism also abounds. Growing up in New Jersey, Mr. Chazelle said, “I had some negative conceptions of Los Angeles, but I was willing to try something other than the East Coast because I wanted to do movies. ” He added: “For a few years, there were ups and downs, but I slowly became smitten. I had never lived in a city with palm trees, and now I’ve been here for almost nine and a half years. ” His debut directorial film, “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” was first shown in 2009, followed by the drama “Whiplash” in 2014. Mr. Chazelle, who recently won the 2016 Golden Globe Award for best director for “La La Land,” recently discussed his current film, Los Angeles and some of his travel forays. Below are edited excerpts from that conversation. Q. In famously   Southern California, what logistical issues did you face with the opening scene of “La La Land”? A. After searching for a filming location, we decided on the FasTrak ramp that connects Interstate 105 to Interstate 110, since it would be easier for the city to shut down. We rehearsed in parking lots, and were able to shut down the ramp to film on a Saturday and a Sunday. On both days, there was a heat wave. In the film, Mia and Sebastian, played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, visit the beloved Griffith Observatory. What was it like to shoot there? We were able to film there on a Monday, which is the only day that they’re closed, but you can’t change or touch anything. Filming isn’t allowed in the planetarium at the Griffith, so professional designers built a replica of the actual planetarium on a sound stage. However, we could light the Observatory on the outside. What’s the story behind the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena, where Mia and Sebastian watch the James Dean classic “Rebel Without a Cause”? The theater is used for special events, but it hasn’t been a functioning commercial movie theater in a while. [The Rialto closed in 2007.] It’s a beautiful old structure, inside and outside. What led you to film in nearby Pasadena? Pasadena is really wonderful. The city is one the best places for architecture in the Los Angeles area since so much has been preserved there. The Colorado Street Bridge [which features a scene with Mia and Sebastian] is one of those places. There are also the homes of silent movie stars. Pasadena seemed far away from where I was living. What has traveling been like since you’ve been promoting the movie internationally? There’s been a fair amount of travel. I’ve had a mini East Asia tour the film opens in China and Japan in February. I’d never been to Japan and had been dying to go there forever. My father is French, so I have a lot of relatives in Paris and France, which is nice. France is like a third home. When you’re headed out of town, what do you usually bring? Ever since I was a kid, I have been fond of long train trips. I like the idea of forced sitting time. I always bring a couple of books and headphones, and weigh down a backpack. If I have something to read and music to listen to, I’m fine."
"Every tree in a forest has a neighbour. In many forest neighbourhoods, the same species are often found living together, especially when the growing conditions are similar. Sometimes these neighbours are close and sometimes far apart, but collectively they form part of a community, with some species naturally being more dominant than others, especially in terms of biomass production. But what happens when the going gets tough? A drought is coming and there’ll be winners and losers.  Droughts can be a big challenge for many trees, and one that is only going to get worse as the world shifts to a hotter, drier climate. Different species have different strategies for dealing with this kind of stress, but how they deal with losing water is particularly important. Trees have tiny pores in their leaves that they can open and close called stomata. Trees lose water through their stomata in a process called transpiration, and absorb carbon dioxide for use in photosynthesis – how plants make their food. Some trees are more conservative, closing their stomata early on in a drought to prevent water loss, but this also limits how much carbon dioxide they can take in and so how much energy they can generate.  Some trees use a riskier strategy and leave these pores open for longer to continue absorbing carbon dioxide, but this also increases the risk of a process called cavitation, which stops them being able to transport water. Clearly, each strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, and all trees sit somewhere between really conservative and really risky. Diversity like this in trees is fortunate, because if every species relied on the exact same strategy it would be a bit like putting all of their eggs in one basket. Having only a single strategy to deal with all that life can throw at them would leave forests pretty vulnerable. A diverse range of strategies for coping with stress is what gives forests some of their essential stability and resilience.  Which species has the best strategy to survive will depend in part on how long a stressful event lasts, how intense it is, how frequently it occurs - and what its neighbours are doing. How all of these different strategies work in a stressful environment like a drought will determine how the whole forest fares. A bit like personalities in humans, sometimes they work well together and everyone benefits, but sometimes they clash.

      The scandal of calling plantations 'forest restoration' is putting climate targets at risk


 Recent research has started to tease apart who wins and who loses when certain species are planted together, and how this changes under stressful conditions. Somewhat amazingly, much of this information can be extracted from tree rings, which contain a physical record of how well each individual tree grew when something like a drought came along. Tree rings allow scientists to see how different trees respond to the same stressful event - and how the identity of the species in their immediate neighbourhood influences this response. Crucially, this research is also shedding light on some of the complicated reasons why species respond so differently depending on who they grow next to. Why some trees do better next to certain neighbours and not others is extremely complicated and not yet fully understood. But at a basic level, we can imagine that each tree species has a whole range of traits, characteristics and functions that make up its personality. How a tree responds to stress might have something to do with the level of direct competition between its neighbours. For example, some trees have deep roots and some trees have shallow roots – two trees with shallow roots will directly compete for water, but a deep rooted species can access water lower down in the soil and avoid some of this competition. This is called “niche differentiation” – by using the environment differently, two different species can occupy the same place.  Being able to predict which tree species will make good and bad neighbours is really important. For instance, placing two trees together that are more risky when it comes to deciding when to close their stomata could mean they use up the limited water quicker than a conservative and a risky tree growing together.

      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Reforesting large parts of the Earth has been suggested as a method for slowing climate change. Technologies are being developed to suck carbon from the air and store it too, but trees have benefited from a 350m year research and development programme that makes them perfect for the task.  Understanding what tree species work well together – and crucially why – can help guide how reforestation is implemented in the decades to come. With a greater variety of tree “personalities”, forests are likely to be more resilient to droughts, pests and diseases than those made up of a single species. Diversity comes in many forms – making sure the forests planted today are resilient in the future will partly depend on choosing tree neighbours wisely.

Tim Beveridge speaks with dairy farmer Mike on Newstalk ZB at 4:30am on Saturday 7th September



 **Tim:**



What… what’s Fonterra’s deal with all this then? Because they seem to be… cosying up to the government…



 **Mike:**



 _(Sighs)_



 **Tim:**



…but is this a political exercise in virtue signalling because they’re bloody useless?



 **Mike:**



Aaah… now I’m getting into a sensitive area. Um… there were people… if you’ve ever read some of the farming magazines there’s quite a bit of angst about certain middle managers who thought they knew… who came into this with no skin in the game, somewhere down the line in Dairying NZ was someone who thought they could show all the industry how to negotiate with the government and then made a total cockup of the whole affair. 



They cosied up to the government, they broke industry ranks and… and it made a mess and now they’re trying to recuperate the mess they’ve made because they’ve agreed to targets which are scientifically impossible to get.



They’ve talked about this methane reduction and methane… unless they allow genetic engineering methane is a by-product of cows eating grass. End of story.



 **Tim:**



I think they’ve got to get with the engineering… I absolutely think they’ve got to go with the science and get it into the education but we’ve got these luddites called the greens who choose… who will ram this down your throat when it comes to climate change and then run screaming into the hills when you talk about what science can do for um… our impact on the environment.



 **Mike:**



They won’t allow science. A lot of it’s written into… into regional plans. Um… I was involved with quite a lot of the _(indistinct)_ plans stuff in the horizons area and they wrote into the plans that only their science was allowed to be used. And basically, everything on that bloody Overseer Programme, sorry to call it bloody but that’s what I mean about it…



 **Tim:**



It doesn’t bother me.



 **Mike:**



That Overseer Programme, it was just a simple computer tool – it got a plus or minus 30% variation rate… and they’re using it as a programme with greenhouse gas. Did you… if you go into the greenhouse gas of what the farmer is producing it simply churns out this figure but there’s no science, well there maybe science in certain areas, but there’s no way of proving it. And they won’t allow you to use your own systems. 



So, getting back to dear old Mr Parker and he’s got a ready reputation of hating farmers, um… he’s got a reputation for having a really sour mouth too, he… he, when he talks to people in a room he has a lot of “F”s into it, he hates it – and you want to know why he hates it? He was a lawyer…



 **Tim:**



Someone should turn on a recording device in these meetings and catch these guys for the way they conduct themselves in private. It’s disgusting.



 **Mike:**



Well, apparently, they um… they went to Helen Clark about him, he was using this language, and she cut him down but Jacinda hasn’t got the ability to cut him down.



 **Tim:**



No.



 **Mike:**



But he actually was involved as a lawyer in the setting up of Fonterra and he was got rid of – that’s why he hates… that’s his sole…



 **Tim:**



So, what’s…. I guess the question is – we’ve actually got this article by… is it Tim Mackle?



 **Mike:**

Because, okay, they want to virtue signal… James Shaw wants to virtue signal we are doing the best. He wants to… he doesn’t want to sit on the laurels of NZ is the best he wants to go further and further and further and be the…

It’s just needless virtue signalling and who’s paying for is? You, me and everyone else.

I’m… I’m picking up a lot of vibes that from people such as yourself, and other people who are promoting that they’re getting pretty angry about it and we’re picking up vibes within the cities and towns that people are not comfortable with this stuff coming out.

I thought Julie-Anne Genter was Associate Transport Minister, but it seems she is Associate Health Minister as well. When you think about the Department of Health, you tend to think about overworked doctors, overworked nurses, waiting lists, sewage in the walls (that turned out to be non-existent), cancer drugs, diabetes…



But Julie-Anne Genter, new, self-appointed Associate Minister of Health does not think about any of those things. Her biggest concern about the health service is… its carbon footprint.



Yes, really. Maybe she can see carbon dioxide too, like Greta Thunberg.



Do you think Julie Anne Genter thinks before she speaks? Do you think she thinks about anything apart from climate change? Do you think in trying to change our view on climate change or to get us to be as obsessive as her, she works out how nutty she sounds before she says stuff? 



Genter is after the health service.   
Not on hospital care, not on patients not getting treatment, not on waiting lists, not on their debt, not on the fact there are too many DHBs, not on the staffing shortages, not on the diabetes epidemic, not on the obesity crisis, not on any health related matter that bogs this country’s health fiscal and social system down.   
But on climate change. Yes, she’s after the hospitals on climate change.   
**And in doing so, she’s sticking yet another knife into the farmers, the backbone of our economy and foreign income success. She wants hospitals serving less meat and less milk to help their carbon footprint.**



This woman is dangerous. Really dangerous. Many people in the hospital are on special diets, that may include increased protein. But Julie-Anne thinks they can get all that from a nutburger and a glass of almond milk. Not to mention that almond milk is significantly more expensive than the real thing.



Do you even think your average hospital worker has time to even consider what their hospital’s carbon footprint is? Or do you think in the old ED department they might be a bit more worried about the knifings, heart attacks, overdoses, and road carnage? But no, ol’ Genter is banging on about the carbon footprint. 



These Greenies are so anti-farming that they forget that it is the backbone of our economy. Well, no… they probably don’t forget. They just don’t care. They lost touch with economic reality a long time ago.



It’s almost like she’s a caricature, and yet she is a woman of power. She is a Minister in the government, a person who can affect real change.   
And yet under a system groaning with systemic trouble, leaking buildings, hundreds of millions of debt, sacked boards and appointed commissioners, all she can muster her energy to produce is yet another time wasting, touchy feely, woke pile of crap, in the form of an edict, to pedal yet again her wacky, out of touch, totally inappropriate agenda.   
As for the farmers, what must they think? Along with the Emissions Trading Scheme, the levies, the water quality attacks, and now an open warfare plan to undermine all they do.



  
I **s she working for the enemy? Is this economic treason? How obscure, weird, and unusual do you need to be before literally everyone writes you off as a joke?**





She is a joke, but the trouble is, about 6% of voters fail to see the Greens for what they really are… dangerous hypocrites who will ruin our economy and our country, all for the sake of a doctrine that is fantasy at best and criminal at worst.



I know hospital food is often dreadful, but if JAG gets her way, it is about to get much worse. Enjoy your tofu, folks. It will be yet another reason to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible and it just might end the obesity epidemic overnight. Maybe that has been her plan all along.

My grandfather made steam engines, my father made a scale steam locomotive for taking children on rides in the park and at the fair. Some of my happiest memories as a child were of sitting behind my father in the coal tender, chugging down the tracks, so any picture of a steam engine brings back fond memories.
[ UPDATE: I hadn’t realized it from the photo above until later, but the 4-6-4 “Hudson” locomotive above is the one my dad modeled for the 1/8th scale train of my youth, except his had the feedwater tank over the front like this one. Our family had to sell the train due to financial hardship after his death to somebody in Lebanon Ohio (probably the saddest day of my life). I’ve since lost track of it and would give anything to get it back, but I fear it has been scrapped. I hadn’t thought about this in a long time but the image provoked some long repressed memories. On the plus side, I’ve located a Lionel model Hudson 4-6-4 Steam Locomotive 665 with 736W Tender on Ebay, and exact match to the engine and tender my dad constructed, which I hope to buy so that I can show it to my children, and pass on the story with something to show them, along with the family photographs. I never thought this topic would come up on my blog, but here it is, serendipitously hitting me with emotion. – Anthony ]
When I saw this, all I could think of is how silly this idea is. All the greens seem fascinated with high speed rail due to Euro-envy, and in California they are ramming it down our throat at an anticipated huge loss, even worse than Solyndra. With a forecast price tag in the tens of billions and growing, it is just nuts given the economic climate right now, not to mention we don’t have people clamoring to climb aboard.
In retrospect however, anything that would put a steam locomotive back on the tracks is music to my ears, even if they ran it on used McDonald’s french fry oil like some of those hippie buses we see here in California.
Here’s the strange part, they are converting an oil burning locomotive to run “biocoal”, and somehow they magically think the production process and the burning of it won’t produce any net CO2, saying the process is “carbon neutral”.  I think they’ve left out some parts, like the energy needed to produce and transport the biocoal fuel in the first place. Excerpts from the MSNBC story:  
A steam train built in 1937 is getting a makeover that will turn it into a “higher-speed” locomotive that runs on biocoal, a coal-like fuel made with woody plant material.
When finished, the train will be able chug along existing tracks at speeds up to 130 miles per hour without contributing to the greenhouse gas pollution blamed for global warming.
…
“Computer simulations already show that the locomotive is about as powerful as two modern passenger diesel locomotives,” Davidson Ward, president of the Coalition for Sustainable Rail, told me Thursday.
“But it will burn carbon neutral fuel.”
The biocoal is based on a so-called torrefaction process pioneered at the University of Minnesota in Duluth. To make it, woody material — in this case trees — are heated in the absence of oxygen. The resulting flaky matter is then rammed together under high pressure to create coal-like bricks.
The charcoal briquettes aka “biocoal”
Biocoal has the same energy density as regular coal, but is cleaner burning, and since trees (the fuel source) sequester carbon as they grow, the system is considered carbon neutral, according to Ward.
…
Today, most higher-speed passenger trains are diesel-electric locomotives, which generate their peak horsepower at low speeds — about 25 miles per hour. Steam locomotives, by contrast, get their peak horsepower at higher speeds — about 40 miles per hour.
“Initial computer simulations suggest that the CSR’s modern steam engine will significantly out-accelerate a modern diesel-electric locomotive to 110 mph,” according to the coalition’s website.
…
I got a big chuckle out of this part though:
If all goes according to plan, they might build a new steam locomotive from scratch, which will have some modern looks.
For example, “no cowcatcher,” Ward said. “You don’t need a cowcatcher today unless you are a ‘Back to the Future’ fan.”
Just wait until they plow into some green gawker driving a Prius, you know it is going to happen.
From the “Coalition for Sustainable Rail” website:
Once its modernization is complete, CSR 3463 will have little in common with the smoke-belching steam engine it once was. Featuring a gas-producer combustion system, improved steam circuit, modernized boiler, low-maintenance running gear and steam-powered electric generator (to power the passenger train), CSR anticipates 3463 will be able to pull a passenger train with electric-like performance for less than the cost of diesel-electric locomotives. In order to further prove the viability of biocoal and modern steam technology, CSR plans to test the locomotive in excess of 130 miles per hour, out-performing any existing diesel-electric on the market and breaking the world steam speed record. In light of this achievement, CSR has named this endeavor: “Project 130.”

Historical 3463 Tech Specs

Locomotive 3463, acquired by CSR through the generosity of its former owner, the Great Overland Station of Topeka, Kansas, is the largest locomotive of its type left in the world and features the largest wheels of any engine in North America. CSR will completely rebuild and modernize the locomotive, doubling its thermal efficiency, converting it to burn biocoal and more. When done, locomotive 3463 will share only the most fundamental resemblance to the engine it once was.

Is Corbynite anti-Semitism taking root in the left wing of Australian politics? There have been disturbing rumbles for years in leftist politics, as the anti-Semitic “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions” (BDS) has become practically an article of faith.



Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has appeared at rallies where placards depicted Jews as monkeys and pigs, while others advocated the murder of Israelis. Greens leader Richard di Natale denies Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. When a Greens activist left a bag of “shekels” on a Melbourne Jewish councillor’s desk, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry stated that “A toxic anti-Jewish culture has ­become well entrenched in the far left of the Greens”.



Now a disturbing campaign is being waged by leftists against Australia’s most prominent Jewish politician.



A senior government front­bencher has accused failed ­independent candidate Oliver Yates and Greens-aligned lawyer Julian Burnside of being “pathetic extremists”, labelling the campaign against Josh Frydenberg’s eligibility to sit in parliament as anti-Semitic.



Housing Minister Michael Sukkar also rounded on Kooyong resident and climate ­activist ­Michael Staindl who has mounted a High Court challenge to the Treasurer’s re-election on the claim that Mr Frydenberg was ­entitled to Hungarian citizenship through his mother, a Holocaust survivor…



Frydenberg’s mother, Erica Strausz, was officially designated “stateless” on her arrival in Australia. As a Jew, she had been stripped of her Hungarian citizenship.



Trevor Poulton — a lawyer who has written a book called The Holocaust Denier — had previously told The Australian he was working with Mr Yates’s “Kooyong Independents Group” to test the Treasurer’s citizenship status.



To be fair, Poulton insists that the book doesn’t reflect his own views. Yet its story of a Melbourne policeman who is “woken” to the “truth” about the Holocaust often comes across as a thinly disguised polemic.



In an extraordinary attack under parliamentary privilege, Mr Sukkar, the member for the Melbourne-based seat of Deakin said the campaign against Mr Frydenberg was driven by “a small number of disgruntled, debauched political activists”.



He described it as “so ­offensive, so disgusting and so ­abhorrent…True to form, the citizenship challenge has also been supported by the other failed candidate in Kooyong, the Greens’ Julian Burnside.



“Burnside is on the record as supporting the BDS, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, movement against Israel, which is of its nature anti-Semitic.



“Burnside has also trivialised the Holocaust by equating Peter Dutton on social media to a Nazi officer — something which Holocaust survivors have said publicly is deeply offensive to them.



“What is with these pathetic extremists?”



Burnside has also denied any association with Staindl’s High Court challenge, although he has also questioned Frydenberg’s eligibility, and continues to support BDS.



After a long history of promoting Jewish interests, the left in Australia has now been skirting dangerously anti-Semitic territory for years. Is it because prominent Jews like Frydenberg have dared cross over to conservative politics? Or is something more sinister infecting left politics in this country?



Some at least in Labor have been wary of holding hands with leftist Jew-haters.



Speaking in 2017, then Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek warned the questions about Mr Frydenberg’s eligibility for parliament were “getting into pretty disturbing territory”.



  
Yet Labor’s new leader has proudly posed for selfies with anti-Semite Jeremy Corbyn.



Labor needs to take a long look at the company it is keeping.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi’s WeatherBELL Analytics presents its latest Saturday Summary.

At about the 5:20 mark, Joe shows how a lack of ice at the North Pole in the summertime is really nothing unusual. Above is the North Pole in 1962 in the summertime.
Joe comments, “If this were occurring up there now, everybody would be going out of their minds. […] All the mainstream media and enviro-blogs would go crazy, right?”
Then Joe shows how the North Pole looks today:

 Of course Arctic sea ice cover reaches it’s low in September and the above picture could change. The point is that an ice-free North Pole would be nothing new.
As Joe explains, Arctic summer sea ice extent is very much dependent on ocean cycles. Once the AMO goes negative again, we’ll likely be seeing ice extent like what we saw at the end of the 1970s.

Guest post by Mark Johnson
What would the climate change debate be without a quote from Rosie O’Donnell. Al Roker was interviewing the talk show host on a Weather Channel segment Monday morning during “Wake Up with Al.” Here’s how the exchange went:
ROKER: “What do you think about the controversy about the people who say, ya know, this whole global warming thing is a scam…a sham?”
ROSIE: “It’s ridiculous. Its absurd. There’s scientific proof. And those are the people who also believe in Creationism, right? I don’t know how you can argue with science in that way when…we’re alive in 2012, and every kind of from of measuring and scientific data. Its a ridiculous thing to say it is not occurring.”
ROKER:”During this winter, when all this weird stuff was going on, were you like a lot of us, going ‘What the heck is going on?’ ”
ROSIE: “You know, I was in Chicago for the winter and everyone said to me, ‘You better get thermal underwear and heated boots!’ Literally, I spent all this money getting all this stuff. It was like spring…it was a joke! It was spring the entire winter! I used my coat once!”
Now, lets review:

According to commedien-turned-climate scientist Rosie O’Donnell,
1) the science is settled,
2) Skeptics are flat-earthers and religious fanatics;
3) one cut-off low pressure in March across the central United States is proof of global warming.
4) Rosie has a gently used winter coat and thermal underwear for sale.
I wonder what O’Donnell would think about underestimated polar bear populations, decreasing hurricane intensity, fewer strong tornadoes since 1974, the forgotten heat records of the 1930s, adjusted arctic temperatures, twelve trees in the Urals, spliced temperature data in the Antarctic, upside down Tiljander proxies, a non-ice free summer arctic, hidden declines, the non-existent big red heat spot, artificial temperature inclines, ClimateGate, FakeGate & hockey sticks.
I guess the word “science” means different things to different people…

From the Data dot Gov website, this data set: https://explore.data.gov/d/8vq3-ke4t
…has been turned into a stunning image of the United states. Each line represents an individual tornado, while the brightness of the line represents its intensity on the Fujita Scale. The result, rendered by John Nelson of the IDV User Experience, shows some interesting things, especially the timeline bargraph that goes with the map, which show that the majority of US tornado related deaths and injury (prior to the 2011 outbreak which isn’t in this dataset) happened in the 1950’s to the 1970’s. This is a testament to NEXRAD doppler radar, improved forecasting, and better warning systems combined with improved media coverage.

Here’s the data description, the big map of the CONUS follows below.
The National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) routinely collects reports of severe weather and compiles them with public access from the database called SeverePlot (Hart and Janish 1999) with a Graphic Information System (GIS). The composite SVRGIS information is made available to the public primarily in .zip files of approximately 50MB size. The files located at the access point contain track information regarding known tornados during the period 1950 to 2006. Although available to all, the data provided may be of particular value to weather professionals and students of meteorological sciences. An instructional manual is provided on how to build and develop a basic severe weather report GIS database in ArcGis and is located at the technical documentation site contained in this metadata catalog.
It is also worth noting that the distribution of strong tornadoes -vs- weaker tornadoes (rated by the Fujita scale) is greatly lopsided, with the weakest tornadoes far outnumbering the strong killer F5 tornadoes (such as we saw in 1974 and 2011, both cooler La Niña years) by at least an order of magnitude:  

And here’s the entire map, click for a very hi-resolution version:

Mike Smith covers a lot of the history contained in this data set in his book Warnings The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather.

He talks about the vast improvements we’ve witnessed since the early days of severe weather forecasting and is well worth a  read if you want to understand severe weather in the USA and how the detection and warning methods have evolved. He has another book just out (Reviewed by Pielke Sr. that explains the failure of this system in Joplin in 2011.
In Mike Smith’s first book, “Warnings: The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather,” we learned the only thing separating American society from triple-digit fatalities from tornadoes, weather-related plane crashes, and hurricanes is the storm warning system that was carefully crafted over the last 50 years. That acclaimed book, as one reviewer put it, “made meteorologists the most unlikely heroes of recent literature.” But, what if the warning system failed to provide a clear, timely notice of a major storm? Tragically, that scenario played out in Joplin, Missouri, on May 22, 2011. As a wedding, a high school graduation, and shopping trips were in progress, an invisible monster storm was developing west of the city. When it arrived, many were caught unaware. One hundred sixty-one perished and one thousand were injured. “When the Sirens Were Silent” is the gripping story of the Joplin tornado. It recounts that horrible day with a goal of insuring this does not happen again.
Of course, alarmists like Peter Gleick (who knows little about operational meteorology and is prone to law-breaking) like to tell us severe weather (and days like Joplin) are a consequence of global warming saying at the Huffington Post:

“More extreme and violent climate is a direct consequence of human-caused climate change (whether or not we can determine if these particular tornado outbreaks were caused or worsened by climate change).”
But in this story from Physorg.com
“If you look at the past 60 years of data, the number of tornadoes is increasing significantly, but it’s agreed upon by the tornado community that it’s not a real increase,” said Grady Dixon, assistant professor of meteorology and climatology at Mississippi State University.
“It’s having to do with better (weather tracking) technology, more population, the fact that the population is better educated and more aware. So we’re seeing them more often,” Dixon said.
But he said it would be “a terrible mistake” to relate the up-tick to climate change.
Again, for a full understanding I urge readers to click, read, and to distribute these two WUWT essays:
The folly of linking tornado outbreaks to “climate change”
Why it seems that severe weather is “getting worse” when the data shows otherwise – a historical perspective

"**A tequila bar has applied to be classed as a place of worship to allow it to open while it is in tier three.**
James Aspell, owner of 400 Rabbits in Nottingham, said it was a tongue-in-cheek gesture to highlight the ""unfair"" rules faced by hospitality venues.
From Wednesday, bars in tier three areas can only offer takeaway and delivery.
However places of worship are allowed to welcome people from the same household or bubble.
Mr Aspell, who opened the bar five years ago, said he had submitted an application to Nottingham's registrar general to reopen the bar as The Church of 400 Rabbits.
""It's tongue-in-cheek but it's come from a serious place,"" he said.
""We think the tier restrictions announced last week and how they're targeted at hospitality businesses like mine seems incredibly unfair. It could be months before we're allowed to open again.
""We looked at the list of every business or venue that's allowed to open under the new system and it said pretty much every other type of business apart from bars and restaurants.
""In Nottingham they're even allowing the Christmas market to go ahead, which is right outside our door - so there'll be crowds of people attending and we're not even allowed to open.
""So we've decided to have a bit of fun with it but the main reason is to shine a light on the ridiculousness of the rules themselves.""
Mr Aspell said the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 required applicants to have people signed up to the congregation - which he plans to do through a dedicated website.
""We sent in all the information requested in the application form - the layout of the building and the timetable of what we're doing etc,"" he said.
""Then you need to prove you have a congregation - I think the minimum is 20 households - so that's the next step.
""I'm not anticipating it being a quick decision at all. They [the registrar general] might just throw it straight in the bin but hopefully they'll contact me fairly soon.""
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Transmission data shows us that hospitality premises are places where infections are more likely to be spread.""

"Take a hard look at the painful process of de-carbonising the UK’s electricity supply, and it’s clear that the options on the table are not great. From the outset, changes to the system generate further problems to be solved. Decommissioning the most polluting coal plants is the place to start, but given that they contribute 30-40% of the country’s electricity supply, this leaves an energy gap that requires filling. Could wind replace coal? The government has an ambitious programme for expanding domestic offshore wind, with the recently commissioned London Array off the East Anglian coast currently producing a world-leading 650MW. But as UK electricity demand ranges from 38-58GW, the energy generated by the London Array and other wind farms is a mere drop in the ocean of what will be required. Could fracking be the answer? A successful domestic shale gas initiative could provide the UK with a greater security of gas supply, possibly cheaper electricity, and a much-needed backup capacity for the rapidly growing wind power sector. Even so, shale gas isn’t low carbon energy and, critically, it’s a finite resource. What about nuclear energy? It’s low carbon and has the potential to produce relatively low cost, reliable electricity. Although nuclear power often sparks debates over safety, a comparison of the number of deaths caused by energy source shows that watt-for-watt, nuclear power causes far fewer fatalities than coal, oil or gas. With support from the British government (and British taxpayers) a consortium led by EDF, the French firm that runs the UK’s current nuclear reactor fleet, is to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. This will provide 3.2GW of baseload power, equivalent to around 5-7% of the country’s electricity demand and enough to power 5m homes. Other companies including Horizon and NuGen also propose to build further nuclear power stations in the UK. Problem solved then? Probably not. Meeting the UK 2050 climate change targets would require in excess of 16GW of nuclear power. No other nuclear plants are guaranteed, and even the most optimistic projections suggest Hinkley Point C will not start generating power until 2023. With costs estimated at an eye-watering £14-16 billion, it comes as no surprise that the barrier to more nuclear power stations is the very large, high-risk capital investment required with large nuclear reactors. But there may be another option: the small modular reactor (SMR), generating power from 300MW down to a very small 10MW. Their definition as “modular” stems from the potential for parts to be precision-engineered on a production line with minimal assembly on site. In principle, factory production drives costs down and reactor reliability up. Currently, the technology’s immaturity prevents a detailed economic evaluation of its potential to deliver cost effective power. However, given external factors such as the future price of gas, carbon taxes and the success of carbon capture and storage, SMRs could still be extremely competitive. The UK parliamentary Energy and Climate Change select committee is examining the potential of SMR, and the outcome of this and other studies could significantly influence the direction of UK energy policy. The main advantage of SMRs is the greatly reduced construction cost. The income from building and selling the first SMR could fund the second, and then a third, and so on until the combined output of the reactors reaches that of a single, large reactor in same the gigawatt range as Hinkley Point C. This would reduce the financial risk associated with large nuclear power stations considerably. It would also reduce the barriers to market entry to a level where smaller firms and utilities could enter, increasing competition and in theory reducing costs further. There are other advantages: SMRs can better exploit passive safety features – those that are immediate in the event of a failure, and require no human intervention. For example, as the reactor core is smaller it produces less heat, and this removes the complete reliance of larger reactors on a dependable coolant to prevent a meltdown. In fact, many designs can dissipate heat through the reactor pressure vessel itself, using natural convection to maintain circulation. The reduced reliance on coolant – typically water – means SMRs could be set up away from coastal sites and moved close to major industrial complexes or cities. They can be made to load follow – adjusting output to match fluctuating demand – and the waste heat they generate can be harnessed to provide heat for homes or buildings, or for use in industrial processes.  Downsized nuclear reactors are by no means a new concept. The UK’s first generation Magnox reactors were small – all under 300MW. And small, self-contained “navalised” reactors are used to power ships – icebreakers, floating reactors used in Russia to bring heat and power to remote locations far from the grid, aircraft carriers, and submarines.  Indeed, the UK submarine fleet is powered by small pressurised water reactors, maintained by Rolls-Royce. With home-grown construction and maintenance expertise, the UK should be taking advantage of these skills to develop and deploy its own SMR design.  The US already recognises the potential of SMRs and has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into helping its nuclear industry design a suite of SMR reactors at a test location at Savannah River nuclear laboratories. If successful, US firms will gain a strong commercial lead in a potentially global supply chain. The question is whether the UK will match America’s ambition."

One White House staffing issue may actually be great news for anyone who uses air conditioning or heating in their home or car.



The recent resignation of Trump administration energy adviser George David Banks means the loss of one of the strongest advocates for the U.S. to go along with much of the world in phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbon HFC‐​134a, the most popular commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) refrigerant.



Banks called for the U.S. to adopt the Kigali Amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete stratospheric ozone.



Although the U.S. is a signatory to the Montreal Agreement, it isn’t bound to uphold the 2016 Kigali Amendment, a separate protocol, which gradually ends the usage of HFC‐​134a on the grounds that it would mitigate some global warming. Kigali has nothing to do with stratospheric ozone.





The Kigali Amendment is an inappropriate protocol purporting to stop global warming that was grafted onto a stratospheric ozone treaty.



Only the Senate can make this decision, but it should use this opportunity to take a stand against the Kigali Amendment, because it would needlessly raise the cost of HVAC while doing little to protect the environment.



HFCs, while miniscule in concentrations, are very potent greenhouse gases, and one study argues that banning them would prevent 0.35 to 0.5 degrees of warming by 2100.



But Andrew Jones, who runs Climate Interactive, a popular site that estimates the effects of various policies, toldScience magazine, “I’m not really buying it,” referring to the 0.5-degree Celsius estimate.



He noted that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the effect to be closer to the 0.1-degree figure. The study cited by Kigali proponents is an outlier among much lower estimates.



HFCs do no significant harm to stratospheric ozone and are the most recent in a series of widely‐​deployed refrigerants. Through the 1950s, ammonia was the go‐​to chemical used for HVAC, but it also had a way of exploding into catastrophic and fatal residential fires.



Stable chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) replaced them. They are so stable that when leaked they survive all the way to the stratosphere, where the molecule is broken down, releasing highly reactive chlorine that destroys stratospheric ozone.



CFCs were then replaced by hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which ate less ozone, with one‐​third of the chlorine per molecule. That was still too much for critics, so that’s when the HFCs came into the picture. They have no chlorine.



There are many possible replacements for HFC‐​134a, and among them are hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which are actually a bit more efficient at cooling than their predecessor and don’t seem to require major changes in compressor hardware. If the world is in a rush to ban the HFCs, HFOs are likely the refrigerant of choice.



The problem is they’re expensive. Two companies, Honeywell and Dupont, hold most of the patents for HFO refrigerants they have branded as Solstice and Opteon; that makes them much more pricey. It’s rumored that the two companies will soon go on an advertising blitz to tout the benefits of their substitutes for HFC-134A and counteract the high price. 



HFC‐​134a, out of patent and made in China, goes for a bit under $7 per pound. Solstice costs $71. A 3500‐​square‐​foot house’s heat pump will require approximately 15 pounds, or $105 worth of HFC‐​134a, but a whopping $1,056 worth of Solstice, and that’s without installer markup. A similar ratio applies to the three pounds that a car air conditioner uses.



Our friends in the EU have already mandated the elimination of HFCs for car air conditioners. Yet, Daimler stopped using the new HFO because under certain conditions (a severe head‐​on collision), it can lead to an aggressive fire.



It is now selling its E‐​class Mercedes with HFC‐​134a, and a legal fight has broken out over its sale. Volkswagen prefers inert carbon dioxide (CO2) as a refrigerant, and while it must be run at a much higher temperature than existing predecessors, the CO2 isn’t going to catch fire.



There may be an interesting co‐​benefit of using carbon dioxide. Manufacturers in Norway have devised a way to use waste heat to warm water. That’s a pretty nifty two‐​fer in the household appliance business.



Forcing Kigali down the world’s throat will stampede the cooling industry into very expensive HFOs. We’ll be forced to buy their more expensive air conditioners because they’re supposedly good for the planet, but the mainstream numbers show an undetectably low mitigation of global warming. 



All this of course is very good for DuPont and Honeywell, but not so for your wallet or the planet. Might we be hindering the development of cheaper alternatives like carbon dioxide compressors that can heat water while cooling the air?



Kigali is an inappropriate protocol purporting to stop global warming that was grafted onto a stratospheric ozone treaty.



Putting that legal faux‐​pas aside, does the Trump administration and two‐​thirds of the Senate really want to raise the price of a new heat pump by more than $1,000 for a virtually unmeasurable impact on global warming?

"The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, promised EasyJet that green taxes would not be levied on airlines six months before the company was given a £600m coronavirus crisis loan with no environmental conditions attached, newly released documents show. Direct lobbying against environmental taxes by Britain’s biggest airline are revealed in Freedom of Information Act responses obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigations unit.  Evidence of the lobbying came as airlines across Europe were set to receive more than €26bn (£22.7bn) in taxpayers’ money for coronavirus bailouts with no binding environmental conditions attached, according to data compiled by Transport & Environment, Carbon Market Watch and Greenpeace. The meeting with Johan Lundgren, the boss of EasyJet, took place shortly after Shapps’s appointment as transport secretary last year. During the meeting, Shapps reassured the CEO he wanted the Department for Transport to be pro-aviation. In a separate meeting a month earlier with the chief executive of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, Shapps also stated that he wanted to reorient the transport department to be “more proactive in promoting aviation”. The easyJet boss used his meeting to criticise the Netherlands’ plans to levy green taxes on airlines, while Shapps “agreed this was not a way forward”. Environmental taxes on aviation to cut greenhouse gas emissions could involve a tax on departing passengers, a fuel tax, or making airlines pay for their emissions, all measures discussed in EU institutions.  But Lundgren said his company would instead be setting up its own sustainability targets, which would involve “gold standard” carbon offsetting, and that EasyJet was involved in the research and development of electric flights. Shapps said the government was committed to investing in electric flights. Minutes of the meetings with Lundgren reveal little talk bout any imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, or aviation’s contribution to the government’s new, legally binding target to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. Emissions from aviation reached record levels last year, and in the past five years have risen by 26%; the sector is responsible for 12 percent of CO2 emissions from all transport sources. This month, with EasyJet flights hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Lundgren asked for and was given a £600m government bailout. The failure to attach any environmental conditions to the loan was a missed opportunity, campaigners say. Fiona Nicholls, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “Carbon offsetting will not clean up aviation’s carbon emissions, just create the illusion it does. EasyJet is peddling snake oil and it’s shocking that the secretary of state seems so willing to buy it. “A green levy on frequent flyers offers the UK a fair more effective way of tackling the sector’s huge impact on our planet. Rather than dismissing the case out of hand, Grant Shapps needs to look again and take this moment to promote a measure that will genuinely have an impact on the climate emergency.” The loan to EasyJet was part of state financial support worth €26bn, either sought, or received, by airlines since the pandemic spread across Europe. None of the bailouts had environmental conditions attached. A spokesperson for EasyJet said: “We recognise we have a responsibility to minimise the impact of our flights and so are focused on both operating efficiently now, and on the development of electric aircraft in the future. Since the technological solution is not yet available, in the interim we offset the carbon emissions from the fuel used for all of our flights on behalf of all of our customers. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  “We have always said that taxing passengers is not the right approach, as this provides no incentives for airlines to improve the carbon efficiency of their flying, it simply acts as a revenue raiser for governments. The way for aviation to address climate change is to invest in new technology; a tax will simply reduce the funds available to airlines for investment, while only having a very marginal effect on emissions.” A separate meeting on 20 August last year with Holland-Kaye came as Heathrow’s expansion was under increasing scrutiny following the net-zero emissions target adopted by the British government that summer. Shapps told the Heathrow CEO that the national policy statement containing airport expansion plans was still government policy, “subject to future confirmation that it remained value for money”. In the past Shapps has been a vociferous supporter of Heathrow expansion, and he admitted to Holland-Kaye that he felt a “personal conflict of interest” discussing the matter, given his previous statements.  Since their meeting, Heathrow’s expansion has been thrown into doubt after the appeal court ruled in February that the government’s airline national policy statement was illegal, because ministers had not adequately taken into account the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis when drawing it up. Heathrow Airport is appealing against the judgment in the supreme court. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Aviation contributes around £14bn to the economy and creates half a million jobs. It is only right that we champion this sector, while continuing our work to make UK aviation the cleanest and greenest in the world.” “The sector must play its part in reaching the UK’s net zero by 2050 target. That’s why we are working with industry to develop new technologies, fuels to cut emissions and are taking a leading role driving international action for the sector.”"

When President Donald Trump declared in September his ambition of sustained US economic growth of between 3pc and 4pc per year, economists baulked.



A survey from the National Association for Business Economics found an overwhelming majority thought growth would slow by the end of this year, with significant headwinds thereafter from the effects of an ageing population. The Congressional Budget Office thought potential US GDP growth would slow to just 1.9pc per year.



The risks of trade wars started by renegotiating the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement and abandoning the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, the potential for actual conflict with North Korea, and proposed clampdowns on immigration, would surely bring uncertainty that would dampen investment.



Well, the forecasters have been wrong, for now at least. Though the larger structural challenges remain, last week’s GDP numbers show the US growing at 3pc for the second quarter in a row. Business investment on new equipment increased at an 8.6pc annualised rate. The US unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2pc. All this before the Republicans have even delivered on their tax cut and reform package, which they are hopeful will slash the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35pc to 20pc, and lower marginal income tax rates too.



Sure, economic risks still exist. Only a fool would forecast sustained uninterrupted growth. But one shouldn’t write‐​off the Donald’s chances of delivering the robust economic performance he promised.



After working its way through Congress the final tax package could change substantially. Free‐​market critics are right that it seems a missed opportunity for broader, more substantial reform.



Nevertheless, should it be delivered, the economists Laurence Kotlikoff, Seth Benzell and Guillermo Lagarda estimate it alone could add between 3pc and 5pc to the level of GDP in the long‐​term. This would translate into wage rises of between 4pc and 7pc.



Critics of course will claim that Trump cannot take credit for this recent uptick in economic performance, because he has not fundamentally altered economic policy.



Though big on rhetoric in his campaign, there has no been no major infrastructure push. Republican attempts to overturn Obamacare and its taxes and mandates failed. Even tax reform hasn’t happened yet. But business leaders do appear to truly believe that economic growth prospects have improved under the new president, and when looking at the administration’s paradigm shift on regulation compared with the Obama era, it’s easy to see why.



All the time the media is focused on the Russia investigation and what Trump is tweeting, the US executive and Congress are slowly undertaking the biggest assault on the regulatory state since Ronald Reagan, if not before him. There have been some major public actions, of course — pulling out of the Paris climate agreement was a big signal the Trump administration would prioritise growth. Just last week Congress repealed a host of regulations in relation to banks. The real revolution, however, is coming through a combination of inaction, repeal and the setting of frameworks for new regulation that could substantially curb the regulatory state.



Back in August the American Action Forum compared Donald Trump’s regulatory performance in his first 200 days as president to Barack Obama’s. Trump, they concluded, had “imposed: 1/​20th of the lifetime costs, 1/​11th of the annual costs, and 1/​8th of the paperwork” through new regulations.



This week, the US Chamber of Commerce has tallied up Trump’s deregulatory actions, estimating that 29 executive orders straight from the president’s desk and 100 additional directives from government agencies have shrunk or eliminated regulatory requirements.



That’s before the efforts from the Republican‐​controlled Congress. They have been using the Congressional Review Act, a vehicle to repeal recent regulations and rules announced by regulatory agencies, to vote their disapproval on rules which came in at the end of the Obama presidency. Trump has subsequently repealed 14 regulations, with another pending. In fact, some Republicans are even examining the prospect of using a loophole in the Act to review old regulations and guidance from years before for which no report was submitted to Congress.



For new regulations, Trump has implemented a “one‐​in, two‐​out” rule akin to something the government in the UK has done. The administration is also keen to introduce more stringent regulatory budgets. Even in areas where legislative activity has floundered, such as healthcare, Trump’s recent executive order gives guidance that could relax regulations to allow people to be able to obtain renewable short‐​term insurance for far lower premiums than under Obamacare.



Individually, some of these actions are small fry. Others are more substantial. But the direction of travel is clear. Under Trump, there is an executive that believes in the power of supply‐​side economics, that wants to lower marginal tax rates on work and investment, and that wants a permissive, light‐​touch regulatory state.



To be sure, huge economic challenges remain. The US long‐​term fiscal outlook is still dreadful, almost entirely due to unreformed entitlement programmes in the face of an ageing population.



A break up of NAFTA negotiations really could lead to lots of short‐​term disruption. As with all economies on the technological frontier, the US economy in the coming decades could be transformed by artificial intelligence and new technologies with significant social consequences.



Yet political discourse is far less fatalistic in the US than in the UK about the ability for policy to improve matters. Trump is going to pull the levers of lower taxes and less regulation to try to pull the US economy back to higher growth in the coming years. And you’d be foolish to write him or America off.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCan We Expect Extreme Weather?
By Ed Caryl
The latest rallying cry from the catastrophic AGW crowd is that we can expect more heat waves, roaming heat waves, popping up unexpectedly and unpredictably. We hear this from Kevin Trenberth here (and refuted by Willis Eschenbach here), and from the PIK here. What about this? Is there any trend toward more heat waves and extremes?

Figure 1: Plot of zonal mean temperature anomaly versus the average over those same years. The 1998 and 2009 El Niños are clearly visible.
Above is a plot with three-month resolution of temperature trend by latitude and time from 1990 using GISS figures. This plot illustrates increasing volatility as one moves from the tropics to the poles. One problem with this plot is that there are few weather stations in the Arctic and Antarctic, so weather at one station represents a rather large area, so one storm system in the Arctic will have more weight than a similar system in the mid-latitudes or tropics. Another problem is that the Arctic had a series of warm periods in 2005 to 2007, and 2009 to 2012, resulting in a warm decade. The warm blobs north of 60 degrees north represent fewer than 10 stations.
A more realistic view will be that of satellites. The satellite coverage, especially in the Arctic and Antarctic, is total compared to surface stations. Here is a plot of tropical, northern hemisphere mid-latitude, and Arctic temperature anomalies over the satellite era.
Figure 2 is a plot of RSS satellite temperature anomaly for three latitude bands, tropical, from -20° to +20°, 20° to 82.5°, and 60° to 82.5°. The Arctic latitude band is offset downward by 1.5°C for clarity (scale on the right). The resolution is one month.

Figure 2: It is easy to see that the Arctic has much more temperature volatility than either the tropics or mid-latitudes, even though the mid-latitude plot includes the Arctic.
One can also see this volatility in Figure 1. But the question of the day is: Is that volatility increasing? To see that, I plotted the absolute value of the differential, the month to month difference, of the data in figure 2. These are plots of the temperature extremes, both cold and hot. The results are Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Figure 3: Plot of the absolute value of the extremes, month to month, for the tropics, 20° each side of the equator. The trend line is an order-3 polynomial.
As one can see in Figure 3, the temperature extremes have nearly no trend at all, just a slight rise in the 1980’s, and a very slight fall in this century. There are peaks around the time of El Niños, followed by calm weather after them.

Figure 4: Plot of the absolute value of the temperature differences, month to month, for the mid-latitudes, 20° to 82.5° north. The trend line is an order-3 polynomial.
In the mid-latitudes, extremes are larger than in the tropics because the arctic extremes are included. The trend was down in the 1980’s, up in the 1990’s, and down in this century.

Figure 5: Plot of the absolute value of the temperature swings, month to month, for the Arctic. The trend line is an order-3 polynomial.
In the Arctic, extremes are much larger. But the trend was down in the 1980’s, then flat with a slight recent reduction since 2007.
No evidence of a trend in increasing extremes
Is there any evidence in the past for an increase in extreme events in the future? A big, round, resounding NO. In fact, the evidence suggests the future may have fewer extreme events. This makes sense from the fact that as the Arctic warms, the temperature differential between the Arctic and the tropics becomes less. It is temperature difference that drives storms. The PIK and Kevin Trenberth are ignoring observations and playing out their climate catastrophe fantasies in computer models.

Last October, I blogged about _Comer v. Murphy Oil USA_, a lawsuit in Mississippi alleging that the defendant oil, coal, utility, and chemical companies emit carbon dioxide, which causes global warming, which exacerbated Hurricane Katrina, which damaged the plaintiffs’ property. Mass tort litigation specialist Russell Jackson called the case “the litigator’s equivalent to the game ‘Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.’” In a brief that Cato was due to file this week, I framed the operative question as, “When a butterfly flaps its wings, can it be sued for the damage any subsequent tsunami causes?”   
  
  
The plaintiffs asserted a variety of theories under Mississippi common law, but the main issue at this stage was whether the plaintiffs had standing, or whether they could demonstrate that their injuries were “fairly traceable” to the defendants’ actions. The federal district court dismissed the case but a dream panel (for the plaintiffs) of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs could indeed proceed with claims regarding public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence.   
  
  
In my blog post, I predicted that the Fifth Circuit would take up the case _en banc_ (meaning before all the judges on the court, in this case 17) and reverse the panel. And this was all set to happen — even though eight judges recused themselves, presumably because they owned shares of defendant companies — with _en banc_ argument slated for May 24. I was planning to head down to New Orleans for it, in part because the judge I clerked for, E. Grady Jolly, was going to preside over the hearing (the only two more senior active judges being recused).   
  
  
But a funny thing happened on the way to legal sanity. On Friday, not half an hour after I had finished editing Cato’s brief, the court clerk issued a notice informing the parties that one more judge had recused and, therefore, the _en banc_ court lacked a quorum. As of this writing, I still don’t know who this judge is and what circumstances had changed since the granting of the _en banc_ rehearing to cause the recusal. And indeed, by all accounts the Fifth Circuit is still figuring out what to do in this unusual (and, as far as I know, unprecedented) situation where a court loses a quorum it initially had — _having already vacated the panel decision_.   
  
  
In short, the court could decide that the vacatur stands and either remand to a (now‐​confused) district court or rehear the case in a new random panel assignment. More likely, however, the court will now reinstate the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad panel decision — and we’ll tweak our brief to make into one that supports the defendants’ inevitable cert petition.   
  
  
All in all, an illustration of the absurdity both of litigating climate change politics in the courts and of forcing judges (including Supreme Court justices) to withdraw from cases for owning a few hundred dollars’ worth of stock. If that’s all it takes to corrupt federal judges, we have bigger problems than trial lawyers run amok!

"Subsidies for onshore wind power were cut by the UK government in 2015. Then the main reasons given were that it was too expensive and that the public didn’t support it. Amber Rudd MP, then head of what was the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said in a statement to parliament: “We are reaching the limits of what is affordable and what the public is prepared to accept.” Fast-forward to 2019: onshore wind is the UK’s cheapest form of electricity, and our newly-published academic research shows that public support for renewables is high and getting steadily higher. Support for nuclear and fracking on the other hand is low and decreasing. These trends are demonstrated by the government’s own data: the UK Energy and Climate Change Public Attitudes Tracker (PAT). The PAT has been running quarterly since 2012, meaning there is a huge amount of data to show how attitudes have changed over the past seven years. In total, more than 50,000 people have been surveyed, making it the largest and most representative dataset of its kind. Along with colleagues at the University of Leeds, I analysed the PAT dataset to dig a bit deeper into what it can tell us. As well as looking at how trends in public support have changed over time, we also explored whether trends varied geographically. While the map below shows there is some variation, the overall trends are pretty consistent across Great Britain. (Unfortunately there isn’t enough data for Northern Ireland to ensure confidentiality). So, are energy policymakers listening to the public? The short answer is: no. At present, the UK government is pursuing the energy technologies which receive the lowest levels of public support (nuclear and fracking), while cuts to various subsidy schemes are making it more difficult for popular onshore renewables such as wind and solar to get built.  One exception is offshore wind – the third most popular technology – which was recently given fresh backing by the government. The survey does not ask about support for fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, so it’s not possible to directly compare people’s preferences with existing fossil-based energy infrastructure.  However, our study does show that concern for climate change was a particularly important predictor of attitudes. People who worried more about the climate were more supportive of renewables, and people who were less concerned were more supportive of nuclear and fracking. As concern over the climate crisis continues to grow (a trend also shown by the PAT), it seems likely that renewables will continue to enjoy high public support, while support for nuclear and fracking (as well as other types of fossil fuel) will continue to fall. This is a positive sign for the transition to a low carbon society. Our results also suggest that some sections of the public may be having a stronger effect on energy policy than others. We found that young people and women were more likely to support renewables, while older people, men and higher social classes were more likely to support nuclear and fracking. It is perhaps not a coincidence that this demographic group has the most similar views to the status quo energy policy, given the lack of diversity in the energy sector. This highlights the need to get more women and people of all social backgrounds into the top energy jobs, so that decisions are more representative of society and its preferences. The UK government recently put into law the bold ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the first major economy in the world to do so. This is a fantastic step in the right direction and sets the bar for other countries around the world. But (and there’s always a but), this is only possible if technologies pursued are genuinely low carbon, cost effective (as renewables increasingly are) and have the backing of the public. Given the introduction of this new net-zero target, it is time for policymakers to rethink the direction of the UK’s energy future, and to listen more carefully to what the public really wants. With average support of 82.5%, solar energy is more popular by far than certain other recent political decisions in the country.

California State Capital in Sacramento (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Guest post by Lorraine Yapps Cohen
California Air Resources Board (CARB) met on Thursday, May 24.  On the agenda was discussion toward deciding where and how to spend the billions raised from cap-and-trade carbon trading in the state.
At the public meeting was Betty Plowman, who attended the meeting to present a letter on behalf of the industries that CARB calls polluters, the California Construction Trucking Association (CCTA) and California Dump Truck Owners Association.  The letter describes CARB’s threats to these industries, induced by the Board’s regulations that are, in turn, based on junk science.  The letter’s signatories indicate intention to seek reparations for the regulated class under CARB’s repression in California.
CARB Chairman Mary Nichols let the clock conduct the agenda and closed the meeting at 5 p.m. before Plowman could present the letter. The world according to CARB disallows any voicing of concerns. 
“It was just another day in paradise, wasn’t it?” said Plowman in her personal communications on the meeting.  “I thought of ‘The Price is Right’ announcer saying ‘come on down.’  Everyone get their hands out; decide where this windfall should go.”
CARB disallowed the presentation of public concerns.  Mary Nichols, in her authoritative overreach, simply adjourned the meeting when dissenting perspective tried to be heard, as seen in this video:

Despite that the letter received no air time at the CARB meeting, the matter is not likely to go away.  The tyranny of Mary Nichols and CARB wears thin on the regulated.  Their letter seeking reparations follows.
RE: Reparations to the Regulatory Class in California
Dear Governor Brown | Mary Nichols: 
Recently, Robert Jenne, Assistant Counsel to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a written statement that we in the specific industries that CARB recognizes as polluters are hereby branded as the “Regulated Class” in California and subject to the rule and regulation of the agency and are bound to accept their rule at any cost. The class includes those who live and work productively in the transportation, manufacturing, construction and agriculture/forestry sectors of the California economy. 
In this letter we inform you of the first action we are taking to meet this threat to our livelihood and our freedom, enacted by unelected bureaucrats without the due process guaranteed to us by the Constitution. 
We the undersigned reject the classification by CARB. In the state of California we represent a minority of the population and have been singled out by regulators simply because we produce the goods and services required to build and maintain a modern society. We request Governor Jerry Brown, Chairman Mary Nichols and the State of California make payment as reparations, to those individuals and commercial entities who have been severely damaged by laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are based on junk science, sometimes conducted by individuals without valid credentials, contrived to achieve the control now shown to be the objective behind the charade. 
Certain California state employees, board members, members of certain scientific review panels, and members of the California legislature and bureaucracy pushed these laws through the Legislature and its agencies without concern for the well being of its citizens, the public health, and the economic well being of the regulated class. Under the guise of a moral crusade to protect the environment, these agents of California government have generated an accumulating residue of economic damage, unintended consequences, bureaucracy and repression. Indeed agents of California government have learned to manufacture hypothetical threats in order to cement and expand state power and to enable the collection of funds needed to sustain and expand its grip. 
California is unique in its extremism and excesses in the ruthless pursuit of societal control. The collapse of the Western Climate Initiative gives evidence that California stands alone in North Americain its activism and agenda. In the same way that the 19th century Confederacy rationalized and defended keeping a large segment of its productive population under extreme exploitive control, today the state government of California takes for granted its ability to control the backbone of its productive population. As Americans we are reclaiming our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Hundreds of thousands of California citizens and businesses have been displaced and/or lost their jobs, careers and homes over agendas borne by radical agents in the California legislature, executive offices, and its supporting cast of NGOs and academics. We as citizens of California can no longer bear the brunt of this attack on our freedoms and exercise our right to protect ourselves from these excessive regulations designed to end our livelihoods and our well being. 
The losses borne by this “Regulated Class” are immense. Details will be provided to you in the form of actual losses from regulations borne by the California Air Resource Board that have no benefit to Man or the environment. We will base our demand for reparations on this accounting. 
Signatories,
==============================================================
The reality is that the state will find a way to grab the money to support its continuing out of control spending, now in the red to the tune of over 16 billion dollars. In effect, this just becomes a backdoor tax scheme. See   http://www.calwatchdog.com/2012/01/11/brown-wants-cap-trade-for-pensions/
The letter’s signatories indicate the intention to seek reparations for damages to the “regulated class” as defined by CARB.  In so doing the class placed itself as a new example of minority exploitation by a repressive state government.

As a followup to a previous story about congressional hearings regarding a proposal to turn over control of the internet to the United Nations International Telecommunications Union, we are happy to report that extensive public pressure has ensured that there remains a bipartisan consensus against allowing this transfer of power over the Internet.

“There’s a strong, bipartisan consensus within the (US) administration and Congress that we must resist efforts from some countries to impose a top-down governance of the Internet,” Representative Henry Waxman told the hearing.
Congresswoman Doris Matsui added that “any international authority over the Internet is troublesome, particularly if that effort is being led by countries where censorship is the norm.”
A top State Department official, in prepared remarks, reaffirmed the opposition of the Obama administration to UN governance of the Internet.
“In all bilateral encounters and multilateral meetings, the United States consistently opposes the extension of intergovernmental controls over the Internet,” said Philip Verveer, deputy assistant secretary of state and coordinator for IT policy, saying this would lead to “very bad outcomes.”
“It inevitably would diminish the dynamism of the Internet,” he said.
Verveer told lawmakers that UN control would possibly “aid in censorship and repression” in some countries.
“Father of the Internet”, Google’s Vint Cerf, said Thursday that proposals to bring the Internet under United Nations’ control “holds profound — and I believe potentially hazardous — implications for the future of the Internet and all of its users”.
The ITU is scheduled to have their annual meeting in December where Russia, China, and other repressive countries will continue to press for this transfer “on behalf of developing countries”.

"As an island nation, Britain has vulnerable communities that must be prepared for the impact of the climate emergency. And while much has been said about homes at risk from the sea in coastal regions, or those inland subject to river flooding, the UK Committee on Climate Change’s new progress report for 2019 has laid bare the challenge facing them. In 2018, Hemsby on the coast of Norfolk in the east of England saw several homes dramatically lost after storm surges caused metres of the sandy cliff edge to collapse. Over the last decade, major storms left substantial areas of England badly flooded for weeks or months, such as in 2007, 2009, 2012, and the winters of 2013-14 and 2015-16. The Environment Agency has said that the UK faces having to abandon areas rather than continue to defend them with the ever higher and stronger flood defences that would be necessary.  According to the committee’s climate change risk assessment it is almost certain that England will have to adapt to at least one metre of sea level rise. Modelling studies have shown that flooding increases exponentially with rising sea levels. So for coastal areas subject to flooding it is not sufficient to increase the height of sea walls in line with sea level rise. The assessment predicts that up to 1.5m properties (including 1.2m residential homes) may be located in areas with an annual flood risk of once in 200 years or more by the 2080s. Around 8,900 properties are located in areas at risk from coastal erosion, this may increase to over 100,000 properties by the 2080s. While coastal erosion affects fewer properties than flooding, the impact is more drastic due to the inevitable and irrecoverable loss of land to the sea.  Significant increases in coastal flood risk are projected to occur as early as the 2020s due to increases in storm frequency. According to the committee’s projections the number of residential properties exposed to flooding more frequently than once every 75 years (on average) is predicted to increase 20% by the 2020s under the scenario which gives a 4°C rise in global temperatures by the 2080s. However, the Committee on Climate Change’s latest report on dealing with these issues scores work on alleviating surface water flooding, and work on ensuring new building development is properly designed to manage flooding, both firmly in the “red” of the red-amber-green traffic light system indicating readiness. Other aspects of flood protection fare only slightly better, with river and coastal development flood protection and alleviation and flood recovery in general marked as “amber”. In the Netherlands, for centuries vulnerable to floods due to its low-lying land, a number of new approaches to water management have been adopted over the years in an effort to live with water rather than to fight it. Schemes range from flood-proof homes, including floating homes, to the Room for the River programme which entails strategies for planned evacuations, temporary relocation of farmers and villagers, and strategic flooding of polders (reclaimed areas separated by drainage dykes). The UK has its own approaches to manage increased flood risk, and is developing new approaches in view of the dire predictions by climate change experts under scenarios of both 2°C and 4°C global temperature rise. River flooding and coastal flooding (from waterway or coastal inundation), as well as surface water and groundwater flooding (from rain and storms and insufficient drainage), were categorised as the most significant sources of risk in the UK now and in the future.  The committee’s projection of flood risk has identified the most cost-effective, engineering-based measures to reduce flooding as improving defences, managed realignment of the coast, catchment area management, and urban runoff management through sustainable drainage systems. In this case, “realignment” of the coast entails not only the natural changes to the physical coastline as a result of climate change, but also the decision to abandon or relocate entire settlements. This can have a significant personal and financial impact on those residents affected. While the abandonment of properties in places like Happisburgh and Hemsby in Norfolk due to coastal erosion is well known, we can see from the map above that many other coastal areas around the Humber, Mersey, Severn and Thames estuaries are at risk. Those affected, and also key infrastructure assets, will need to be evaluated to ascertain whether they should be included in this process of coastal realignment. The area around the Thames in southern England is likely to be classed as worth protecting due to the high numbers of people living there, for example. In addition, a number of low-lying inland plains will also be lost – many of which were selected for housing development only a few decades ago. While planning and building regulations can reduce flood risk to new-build properties within affected areas, anticipated population growth means that there is increasing pressure to build on floodplains. According to Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, the number of properties built on floodplains will double over the next 50 years, creating further flood risk problems. The UK has a significant number of key industries and infrastructure at the coast – for example power stations, petrochemical plants, steel industries and oil and gas infrastructure. To tackle the associated design challenges for housing, business and industries appropriate funding and having a well-skilled engineering force will be key.  In view of the increasing impact of climate change we need to urgently build our resilience to flooding. Flood resilience includes knowing what the risks are and where. We need flexible engineering solutions, including natural flood risk management, as well as ways to help society adapt. We need to make sure we have the right people with the right skills at all levels to address related socio-economic issues, including hard decisions on what to fight to keep, and what can be lost."

Almost every major American daily newspaper picked up an article published earlier this month by _New York Times_ scribe Justin Gillis entitled “A Warming Planet Struggles to Feed Itself.”



How many times have we read, in the last 50 years, that this or that environmental apocalypse is going to starve the world? I got my doctorate on the wings of one; at that time it was called “global cooling,” after a 1974 CIA report leaked to the _Times_ said that rapidly cooling planetary temperatures could usher in an era of heightened global instability caused by food shortages.



In my lifetime there have been a large number of predicted nutritional apocalypses, caused by overpopulation, lack of biological diversity in our food supply, genetic engineering run amok, acid rain, too little ozone, too much ozone and, finally, global warming. If there were futures on the end of the world, I’d go short. The wrong bet won’t matter anyway.



Facts: Global surface temperature rose about three‐​fourths of a degree Celsius in the 20th century. U.S. corn yields _quintupled_. Life expectancy _doubled_. People got fat. Global warming didn’t cause all of this, but increased atmospheric carbon dioxide directly stimulated plant growth. Further, greenhouse warming takes place more in the winter, which lengthens growing seasons. With adequate water, plants then fix and yield more carbohydrate.



While doing my dissertation I learned a few things about world crops. Serial adoption of new technologies produces a nearly constant increase in yields. Greater fertilizer application, improved response to fertilizer, better tractor technology, better tillage practices, old‐​fashioned genetic selection, and new‐​fashioned genetic engineering all conspire to raise yields, year after year.



Weather and climate have something to do with yields, too. Seasonal rainfall can vary a lot from year‐​to‐​year. That’s “weather.” If dry years become dry decades (that’s “climate”) farmers will switch from corn to grain sorghum, or, where possible, wheat. Breeders and scientists will continue to develop more water‐​efficient plants and agricultural technologies, such as no‐​till production.



Adaptation even applies to the home garden. The tomato variety “heat wave” sets fruit at higher temperatures than traditional cultivars.



However, Gillis claims that “[t]he rapid growth in farm output that defined the late 20th century has slowed” because of global warming.



His own figures show this is wrong. The increasing trend in world crop yields from 1960 to 1980 is exactly the same as from 1980 to 2010. And per capita grain production is rising, not falling.



Gillis more rightly could have blamed any loss in per capita consumption on the stupid (I choose my words carefully) global warming policy that greens once touted: ethanol production from corn.



Even Al Gore now admits that corn‐​based ethanol produces more carbon dioxide than it saves. But as a result of recent ethanol policy, we are the first nation in world history to burn up its food supply to please a political faction.



Indur Goklany, a much‐​published scholar on the consequences of global warming policies, recently calculated that in 2010 alone, diversion of grain to biofuels (like ethanol) caused nearly 200,000 excess deaths in the developing world because of increased prices.



Roger Pielke, Jr., another noteworthy student of global warming science and policy, concurs. Regarding Gillis’ piece, he says: “The carbon dioxide‐​centric focus on the article provides a nice illustration of how an obsession with ‘global warming’ can serve to distract attention from factors that actually matter more for issues of human and environmental concern.”



Ever since people noticed how robust the increase of crop yields is, others have been saying that it must soon stop. This “limits to growth” argument is as tired as a farmer at the end of harvest. Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Global Wheat Rust Symposium that scientists are now producing “super varieties” of pathogen‐​resistant grain, which will tack another 15% onto yield. As the new strain is adopted, it will continue the linear upward trend in wheat yield for at least another decade.



I continue to be amazed at how little the facts are checked on global warming, even when writing for the so‐​called newspapers of record. Crop yields have increased at a constant rate despite changes in global temperature. Per capita grain production is going up, and stupid policies — not global warming — are putting people’s food security at risk.

"**Door-to-door carol singing should ""probably not"" take place in Scotland this Christmas, the country's national clinical director has suggested.**
Professor Jason Leitch was responding to questions after new advice for England said it would be allowed in groups of up to six people.
He said the Scottish government had not yet taken a position on the issue.
But he was ""worried"" about door-to-door singing and his ""instant advice"" was that should probably not happen.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said they would look at any changes to the advice in England, and consider whether there was a case for a similar change in Scotland.
On Sunday, the UK government published its latest guidance on the rules which will apply in England over the Christmas period.
It said carol singing and carol services could take place as long as those involved followed advice on singing safely.
Door-to-door carol singing is also allowed, but groups must contain a maximum of six people.
The rules have been introduced because singing increases the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets and aerosols in the air.
At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she had not yet looked at the English guidance.
However, she was ""not aware"" of any change to the general advice that singing was one of the things which could help transmit the virus.
Prof Leitch said that if anything, the evidence about the aerosol transmission of the virus had ""hardened"" - especially in unventilated spaces.
He acknowledged it was ""very hard"" for people to not be able to sing in choirs and at worship services, but that remained the advice.
Prof Leitch added: ""We haven't taken a position on outdoor carol singing.
""That would be less risky than indoor, but you have to remember that we have restrictions on the numbers that can meet, and door-to-door would also worry me.
""Going from door to door, I'm afraid we would be presented with the same challenges as we were at Halloween. So my instant advice is probably not.""
Children were advised to stay at home and not go guising door-to-door at Halloween.
The English guidance also says that Santa's grottos can open if they are in venues which are allowed to open under the tier system of Covid restrictions.
Ms Sturgeon said this was ""an important issue"" for a lot of people.
""I know we are working on guidance for Santa's grottos. I am not sure if it has been published in full yet, so we will publish that as soon as possible.""
Prof Leitch said the guidance had been worked on ""over the weekend"" and would be published soon."

Here we have a press release in 1999 (email 3384) from Environmental Media Services (Fenton Communications, operator of RealClimate.org) sent on behalf of the WWF to help bolster the Kyoto Protocol.
I loved this line:
Cities including New York and Tokyo may face flooding; large swathes of Latin America will suffer from drought and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef may be destroyed unless more is done to stop global warming, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature warned Tuesday.
There’s that weasel word “may” and of course no timeline is given. Here we are a decade later and this press release sounds like it could have been written yesterday for Durban. The gloom and doom hasn’t changed.
The other fun part is this: 
WWF commissioned the Climatic Research Unit at Britain’s University of East Anglia to conduct research into various climate change scenarios over the next few decades.
It projected that sea levels would rise between three-quarters of an inch to four inches per decade. This would threaten low-lying U.S. coastal cities such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Miami with flooding. The Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka among others would also be at risk, it said.
I wonder how that research was accomplished and how much money was involved. “Commissioning” a scientific study usually means a predetermined result. Anyone have any idea what these commissioned studies were?
I’m pretty sure New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Miami are still here. Ditto for Tokyo and Osaka.
Here’s the full email:

"Starfish along much of the North American Pacific coast are dying in great numbers from a mysterious starfish wasting syndrome. As yet the cause of the syndrome is unidentified, and it’s not clear whether it’s a due to an environmental change, disease or or something else.  The early signs vary by species affected and include a deflated appearance, unnatural twisting of the body, and small lesions on the surface that increase in size and number. The wasting often progresses rapidly, leading to the softening of the starfish’s hard body, loss of arms, and eventually complete disintegration and death, sometimes over a period as short as few days. Similar die-offs have occurred before in the 1970s and the 1990s, but never before at this magnitude and over such a wide geographic area. The current bout of this wasting syndrome was first noted in ochre stars (Pisaster ochraceus) in June 2013 along the coast of Washington state during monitoring surveys conducted by researchers from Olympic National Park. As ONP is part the Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network (MARINe), a long-term monitoring effort that extends down the whole west coast, researchers from Alaska to California were quickly alerted.  The majority of early observations were made in intertidal (tidepool) habitats and as a result most of the early reports were for ochre stars, the most common in the habitat, but others species affected include the mottled star (Evasterias troschelii), leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), and six-armed stars (Leptasterias).  In August, divers investigating subtidal habitats reported massive die-offs of sunflower starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides) just north of Vancouver, British Columbia. Shortly afterwards, other subtidal sea star species in the region began showing signs of wasting. During October and November, a similar mass death of starfish occurred in Monterey, California, with another die-off of sunflower and ochre stars around Seattle, Washington, with the syndrome spreading throughout the Puget Sound. In mid-December, substantial numbers of wasting starfish were spotted around southern California. By the turn of the year it had been reported in 45 of the 84 MARINe sites from Anchorage to San Diego sampled since that summer, and in the last few months it has spread to Mexico and parts of Oregon, which had previously been unaffected. It is also intensifying, appearing at additional sites in those regions already affected.  In subtidal habitats, the sunflower star is typically the first species to succumb, followed by the rainbow star (Orthasterias koehleri), giant pink star (Pisaster brevispinus), giant star (Pisaster giganteus), mottled star, ochre star and sun star (Solaster), leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), vermilion star (Mediaster aequalis), six-armed stars, and bat star (Patiria miniata). We don’t know whether the syndrome spreads sequentially from one species to the next, or if some species simply take longer to express symptoms, but the usually large populations of ochre and sunflower stars have experienced massive, geographically expansive (if patchy) and well-documented declines. Other species are less abundant, so the impact of the syndrome is not as clear. Ecologists consider both sunflower and ochre stars to be keystone species because they have a disproportionately large influence on other species in their ecosystem. In fact it was ochre stars that Robert Paine experimented on when he coined the term keystone species in 1969. After removing many ochre seastars, a voracious predator of mussels, from his test area, he found that mussels out-competed other species and dominated areas where previously many species were attached to the rocky shore. Hence seastars were necessary to maintain the species composition. So it’s anticipated that the sheer number of starfish of different species that have died may lead to radical change the seascapes in the subtidal (below the tidal line) and intertidal (between high and low water marks) zones. This is what has occurred after widespread death of particular marine species on previous occasions, resulting in dramatic ecosystem-wide changes. From extensive samples collected researchers have begun to identify the agent behind the syndrome, and the environmental conditions that may have led to the outbreak. One of the top priorities is to confirm that an infectious agent is involved, and if so what it is. Molecular sequencing work of samples is underway at Cornell University to identify possible viruses and bacteria that could be causative agents.  Current thinking is that there is an infectious agent involved, likely a pathogen. Importantly there is no evidence at all that links the current wasting event to the ongoing disaster at the Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan. Long-term monitoring by MARINe groups and other partners along the entire west coast provides the information to compare distributions of different starfish species over 30 years.  MARINe has also developed a tracking log that can be downloaded from the seastarwasting.org website, which researchers, divers, and members of the public can use to report their observations, gathering information to help identify further outbreaks."

I just watched this video interview on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show (h/t to Poptech)

Despite the tacky caption, it was what Dr. Muller didn’t talk about that was, ahem, the best part. 
To my surprise, when questioned on the issue, he didn’t list station quality as one of the things he ruled out.  I think my message was delivered.
If you can get past the “genius” lead in part, its worth watching. Video here

"The 2014 World Cup in Brazil is over. It brought much joy, and huge disappointment for the hosts – perhaps even worse than the Maracanazo in 1950. Now attention in Brazil will turn to hosting the next great inter-cultural event, the 2016 Rio Olympics. And the football world will plan for the next World Cup in another BRIC country, Russia in 2018.  But the global challenges faced by us all cannot just be addressed in four-year planning rounds. Climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation and growing social and economic inequalities: these are all facing tipping points over the next 50 to 60 years, requiring some long-term thinking by governments and policymakers in both the fast-growing and already affluent countries of the world.  Thomas Piketty has shown in his hugely influential book, Capital in the 21st Century, that income in most countries is now distributed more unequally than in the 1970s, and the projections into the future are for this to worsen. The rich are getting relatively richer, the poor are getting relatively poorer, and the middle is becoming increasingly squeezed. There is evidence that unequal countries are unhappier.  The income Gini coefficient for Brazil is high, which means that relatively few people are reaping the rewards of Brazil’s economic successes of recent times. The same is true for all other BRIC countries, but many affluent nations too. Even in Germany and other northern European countries, which have traditionally been more equal, the Gini coefficient has been rising over the past two decades. If this trend continues, the world will increasingly become like the unequal parts of Brazil, not the other way around.  But citizens will not accept rising levels of inequality for long. The recent World Cup-related protests in Brazil show that people are discontent with poor public services and diverted public expenditure on infrastructure, like football and athletic stadiums, that appear to enrich those parts of the economy that are already wealthy. This might be a sign of things to come.  Brazilians are demanding better education and transport, as well as a clampdown on widespread corruption. Now that the World Cup is over, it is these issues that will keep Brazilian policymakers awake at night, not the host’s dismal performance in the semi-finals.  Another tipping point in the making is in the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest. It is hugely important as one of the world’s most biodiverse places and a “carbon sink” of planetary importance. It is also crucial for regulating the weather for large parts of the North Atlantic area. There is evidence that the Amazon’s dry season is becoming longer, due to climate change and decades of deforestation. Less rainfall, more forest fires and continuing deforestation – these factors are already reinforcing one another, risking a dangerous tipping point for the entire rainforest. By the middle of this century large parts of the Brazilian Amazon could have become dry savannah with immense implications for the world’s carbon cycle and weather patterns, not to mention the planet’s gene pool. Although Brazil’s economy is greener than most of its peers, with less-than-average carbon emissions per capita, its hydropower and biofuel revolution have been contributing to deforestation. Large scale soy and maize plantations – largely for export to China – are also to blame. While the Brazilian government is trying to protect the Amazon from unregulated agricultural expansion, some agri-businesses have been lobbying hard for less stringent protection of the Amazon.  Brazil’s commodities-based export economy is not sustainable in the long-run. If Brazil’s wealth continues to be dependent on extractive models, which do not account for all of their, what economists call, externalities, then the Amazon will not survive, and we will breach more planetary boundaries.  There are alternative models of development that promise more equitable and sustainable futures. We demonstrate how communities in both affluent and developing countries are already taking action to build resilient and sustainable lifestyles in our forthcoming book, Ecocultures: Blueprints for Sustainable Communities. Ecocultures are exemplars in the art and science of sustainable living. For us, ecocultures are communities with high social capital, showing strong internal coherence and equity, as well as with close connections to nature. One of our case studies is from the south of Brazil. The Céu do Patriarca ecovillage is a self-organised, ecologically-driven community in the state of Santa Catarina. Established 25 years ago, the community has become a model for increased social, ecological and personal well-being and resilience. Our argument is not that we all have to move to ecovillages in the middle of the rainforest. But policymakers can learn from the design principles of these ecocultures, exploring opportunities for scaling them up to city, regional or even national levels.  This scaling-up has already begun. There are excellent examples of sustainable practices in Brazilian cities, such as Curitiba. Urban agriculture, for example, can reconnect people to nature, as well as provide local food to urban, and particularly disadvantaged, communities. In many ways the world is condemned to radically change its ways of life to face the challenges ahead. Ecocultures could provide policymakers in Brazil, and in other countries, with important lessons on how to transition to a more sustainable and equitable future. This might just save the planet. Brazil, though, might not want a World Cup for at least another 64 years."

Much of Northern Europe, including Britain, is suffering under the coldest winter and spring of the last 30 to 100 years. The Northeastern part of the United States has had a record cold March. The record cold in Europe has killed thousands and cost billions. It was not supposed to be this way.



Back in 1998, scientist Michael Mann published a paper with the famous “hockey stick” showing a sharp rise in global temperatures. Mr. Mann and others argued that if global action was not taken immediately, then the temperature rise would be rapid and uncontrollable. Much of Mr. Mann’s work was the basis for Al Gore’s famous film _An Inconvenient Truth_. What has turned out to be an inconvenient truth is that Mr. Mann and his allies were sloppy in their research and engaged in a campaign to disparage their critics.





It’s hard for believers to admit they’re wrong.



The United Kingdom’s Met Office has been a major source of global temperature data in recent decades, and has been heavily relied upon by global‐​warming proponents. On March 12, a report written by David Whitehouse and published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation concluded that “there has been no statistically significant increase in annual global temperatures since 1997.” In the accompanying chart, using the same official data from the Met Office that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses, it can be easily seen that global temperatures have not been rising as predicted by the best‐​known climate models.



According to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, “The report shows that the temperature standstill has been a much discussed topic in peer‐​reviewed scientific literature for years, but that this scientific debate has neither been followed by most of the media, nor acknowledged by climate campaigners, scientific societies and prominent scientists.” Lord Turnbull, former Cabinet secretary and head of the Home Civil Service, commented: “Dr. Whitehouse is a man who deserves to be listened to. He has consistently followed an approach of examining observations rather than projections of large‐​scale computer models, which are too often cited as ‘evidence.’ He looks dispassionately at the data, trying to establish what message it tells us, rather than using it to confirm a pre‐​held view. “Those of us who have studied “public choice theory” are not particularly surprised that many scientists and their media followers are in denial about what is increasingly obvious — that is, most of the climate projections were just plain wrong. If a person has a strong vested interest in a particular point of view and obtains government grants to show what politicians want to hear, or if he has been very public in his beliefs based on faulty data or information, it is hard to say, “I was wrong.” Politicians embrace any theory that justifies more taxing, spending and regulating because their power increases along with the accompanying financial opportunities. Nobel laureate, economist and philosopher F.A. Hayek explained how there are limits to the knowledge that any one individual can possess, yet many have the “fatal conceit” that they know more than they do, and thus, they think they can plan and predict in ways they cannot. It is no surprise that climate models were wrong. For them to have been right, the model builders would have had to know all of the significant variables that affect climate, and the magnitude and interaction of each of those variables. There is virtually no single variable on which scientists are in total agreement about the magnitude of its effect. Carbon dioxide (CO2), for example, is considered to be very bad by most global‐​warming alarmists, including many officials in governments. We know that some level of CO2 is necessary for life, but we do not know the optimum level. The higher the level, the more rapidly plants grow, and the cheaper food becomes. It is just as plausible to say that there is too little CO2 in the atmosphere as that there is too much to maximize human well‐​being.





One of the world’s foremost experts on climate change, professor Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado at Boulder, recently wrote: “Flooding has not increased over the past century, nor have landfalling hurricanes. Remarkably, the U.S. is currently experiencing the longest‐​ever recorded period with no strikes of a Category 3 or stronger hurricane.” These anecdotes, along with a cold March, prove nothing one way or the other except that human beings know very little about what drives the climate.



Germany has spent more than 100 billion euros ($130 billion) on subsidizing the solar industry; yet, as _Der Spiegel_ reported, “the 1.1 million solar systems have generated almost no power” this winter, and Germany is forced to import power from elsewhere. They are paying three or four times the U.S. rate for electricity, making many of their industries noncompetitive. The U.S. has been equally stupid. Even _The New York Times_ has acknowledged that the U.S. ethanol experiment has been a disaster. It has actually increased carbon emissions and the price of fuel and world food, which really whacks the poor — all because of a “fatal conceit.”

This letter to Dr. Richard A. Feely of NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environment Laboratory Carbon Program in Seattle, WA was sent by Chuck F. Wiese on Wednesday. Chuck also asked me to post it on WUWT but I wanted to see if NOAA would fix the error on the web page first. It is now Saturday, and they haven’t, so I think a public notice is appropriate. I suppose I’m not surprised though, since Dr. Feely lists “Nobel Peace Prize (co-shared with Al Gore and other members of IPCC) – 2007” on his web page. I suppose anyone who lists Al Gore along with the gross errors he makes, such as his laughably non-reproducible “high school physics” of CO2, would not bother to correct their own gross errors. – Anthony
==============================================================
Dear Dr. Feely:
I exchanged e-mails with you a while back over a story that ran in the Oregonian on April 12, 2012. It was about “ocean acidification” that was supposedly killing off what would otherwise be healthy oyster harvests here in the Northwest, The story can be found here:
http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/04/oregon_state_research_traces_o.html
An OSU researcher who gave the story to the Oregonian, Alan Barton, had incorrectly asserted that the ocean pH had risen 30% because of human CO2 emissions and gave that as the reason the oyster harvests had been suffering. And he qualified that statement by stating that the ocean pH had moved .1 unit towards acidity over the last century.

But as you know, the equation for the pH of an aqueous solution is logarithmic and defined as pH = -log[ H+ ] . As you also know, there are 14 orders of magnitude that define the pH scale from zero to fourteen units as per this equation. So a movement of .1 units towards acidity cannot equal a 30% increase in acidity as claimed in this article. It is actually .1/14 or only 7/10ths of 1%. In order for there to be the increase cited, the researchers solved it for the hydrogen ion concentration and computed that change instead and called it the change in acidity. So if we moved .1 units towards acidity from the alkaline 8.2 to 8.1 oceans and compared the change, we have [delta H+] = 8 E-9/6 E-9 = 1.33 or a 33% increase in the hydrogen ion concentration, not an increase of 33% in the pH. None the less, that is how the story was reported and it is wrong.
Since the natural variation of ocean pH can be up to 5% in either direction, I am speculating that in order to make the story seem legitimate, a gross exaggeration of fact was needed to sell it and hence the switch and bait tactic was used with the pH equation.
You agreed with me in my premise that hydrogen ion concentration makes up the pH but it is not defined by that number because the number of ions in an aqueous solution of water are very large. That was the whole idea behind creating a logarithmic scale with the 14 orders of magnitude to define it. I reported this to the Oregonian readership and thought the issue was settled. But then I found this:
http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F

In this explanation offered by NOAA, of which you are a senior scientist, we are back to the trickery of claiming the ocean acidity has increased by 30%. Are you aware of this NOAA information page? It needs an immediate correction. The ocean pH has been changing everywhere within natural variations. There is no provable decrease that can be identified with atmospheric CO2 that is related to human activity. Does Jane Lubchenco understand this? She has made numerous and completely false assertions that the up welling ocean water off of the Northwest coasts ( that will be on the rise because of the switch to cold phase PDO in 2007 that will run thirty years and likely decrease the pH additionally ) is attributable to human caused climate change. There is absolutely no proof of this and as far as meteorologists can tell, the mid and north Pacific Hadley cell summer circulation has intensified on schedule and is behaving perfectly normally in the cold phase of this ocean cycle. Either you or Lubchenco need to correct this page. It is misleading the public.
Sincerely,
Chuck F. Wiese
Meteorologist

"Barcelona just had a week of temperatures above 30℃. It’s a few degrees hotter than the long-term average, but no heatwave. In winter, Spain’s second largest city is typically a mild 15℃ or so. With its climate regulated by warm Mediterranean waters, temperatures rarely drop below freezing. Is this what the future holds for London? One group of scientists certainly thinks so. In a new study, they have tried to convey the risks of global warming by finding the closest modern-day climates to describe what the future might be like for certain cities. They predict that, for instance, Madrid’s climate in 2050 will be like Marrakech’s climate now, Seattle will resemble San Francisco, Stockholm will feel like Budapest, and that London will become like Barcelona. It makes sense to focus on cities as they are literally “hot-spots” of climate risk due to their dense populations, concentration of assets and susceptibility to extreme weather. Getting this message across to city managers and vulnerable communities is not always easy.  The researchers gathered data on the background climate of 520 major cities. Nineteen variables, including maximum temperature of the warmest month and precipitation seasonality, were combined using a statistical method that takes account of their relative importance and interrelationships. Equivalent variables for 2050 were obtained from three climate models, which were all programmed to take the optimistic view that emissions will stabilise this century. Present and future city climates were then used to “twin” the most similar metropolises. Pairing cities in this way is a clever idea. But such like-for-like comparisons are just too simplistic. This is because cities make their own climates according to their unique layouts, building materials, artificial heat sources, amounts of open or green spaces, and types of water feature.  There can be fundamental differences between two cities in these respects. For example, Barcelona has among the highest population densities in Europe, at about 16,000 per square kilometre, more than the 10,000 or so recorded by inner London boroughs. Population density is a useful indicator of both the intensity and level of exposure to the urban heat island – compact cities tend to be hotter cities. While Barcelona is striving to become a greener city, nearly two-thirds of Greater London is already occupied by gardens, parks and water. Across the city, such spaces provide cool refuges for people and biodiversity. For instance, satellite observations reveal that on a hot summers day Richmond Park – a large space on the western edge of the city known for its deer – can be about 10°C cooler than parts of the more central Southwark, Lambeth and Westminster. Even in these central boroughs, temperatures are chillier along the Thames embankment than just a few hundred metres away. Hence, the multiple micro-climates experienced day-to-day and from place-to-place within a city are not readily characterised by a few summary statistics. The actual “felt” temperature depends on a host of factors, not least the effect of atmospheric humidity. Conditions can become lethal when dangerous combinations of temperature and humidity are exceeded – something that unfortunately already occurs in cities such as Karachi in Pakistan or Kolkata in India.  Global warming means that 350m more people could be exposed to deadly heat by 2050 – and South Asian mega-cities are in the front-line. However, with 4°C of global warming even New York could become heat stressed. So any assessment of future conditions in global cities should evaluate the combined threat of heat with humidity. According to the Lancet Countdown 2018 Report, threats to human health from heatwaves are becoming more frequent and dangerous. Despite the above reservations, the new study does alert us to the possibility that over one-fifth of the studied cities could shift to climate conditions hitherto unobserved anywhere on Earth. This applies to cities such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Libreville in Gabon and Manaus in Brazil, which are all in the tropics.  Extraordinary temperatures are already being experienced within the homes and workplaces of some low income communities of cities such as Accra, Ghana. Trying to visualise how these places might be further stressed by climate change is an important step towards improving the well-being of some of the world’s most vulnerable urban citizens.

"**An outdoor festive lights show has been cancelled after police and council officials said it breached coronavirus regulations, organisers say.**
The Fonmon Festive Lights Show had been due to get under way at Fonmon Castle, in the Vale of Glamorgan, on Friday.
But just hours after organisers said it had been given the ""all clear"" from environmental health officials, it was cancelled.
The Vale of Glamorgan council said it was ""in dialogue"" with organisers.
Organisers of the show say the new regulations prohibit outdoor events attended by more than 30 people over the age of 11 at any one time.
But organisers claim they had been caught by surprise by the new rules after they were given permission by Vale of Glamorgan Council just two hours before it was due to begin.
About 500 people had been expected to attend the light show each evening, spaced out over six hours, at the 30-acre (12.1-hectare) site.
""We created a safe, secure environment under the current Covid Laws which we hoped would have provided a much needed uplifting end to the year,"" organisers said in a statement on Facebook.
But due to ""a very recent change"" to environmental health laws in Wales, staff said they were ""very disappointed to say that it is no longer viable or operationally possible for us to proceed as planned this year"".
People who purchased tickets are being offered full refunds or the opportunity to transfer tickets for future events.
The statement added: ""Fast changing laws like these make it difficult for any business to survive but we will not let this stop us and we will all push onâ¦ somehow.""
A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan council said: ""It was agreed the light show would not continue beyond Friday night and we are in dialogue with the organisers as the regulations continue to evolve."""
"Mayors from many of the world’s leading cities have warned there can be no return to “business as usual” in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown. City leaders representing more than 750 million people have published a “statement of principles”, which commits them to putting greater equality and climate resilience at the heart of their recovery plans.  Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City and one of the signatories to the statement, said: “Half-measures that maintain the status quo won’t move the needle or protect us from the next crisis. “We need a new deal for these times – a massive transformation that rebuilds lives, promotes equality and prevents the next economic, health or climate crisis.” Many cities have already announced measures to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. In London, Sadiq Khan announced plans on Wednesday to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians across the capital in an effort to encourage “green and sustainable travel” and prevent a spike in car use and pollution after the lockdown. The move came as Transport for London modelling revealed there could be a 10-fold increase in cycling, and up to five times the amount of walking, compared with pre-coronavirus levels, if people returned to work but avoided public transport. Khan, who is vice-chair of the C40 group, said he was determined to “build a better future” in the aftermath of the pandemic. “Covid-19 has exposed the inequality in our society and deep flaws in our economy, which fail people from deprived communities more than anyone else,” he said. “We need to come out of this embracing a new normal and with a renewed drive to address the climate emergency.” In Greater Manchester, council leaders have unveiled plans to give more space for people walking and cycling across the region. With £5m of funding from the mayor, local authorities are planning a range of measures from extending pavements to creating one-way streets, removing through-traffic from residential neighbourhoods and building extra cycle lanes. Last week, mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks as part of a newly formed C40 economic task force. They agreed to coordinate efforts to map out plans to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis. Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. “There is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,” he said. “We are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into, which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings … C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.” The statement of principles has so far been signed by mayors representing 33 world cities from Los Angeles to Lisbon, São Paulo to Seoul, Melbourne to Mexico City. The statement warns that the recovery from Covid-19 “should not be a return to ‘business as usual’ – because that is a world on track for 3C or more of overheating.” It also states that immediate action on the climate will “accelerate economic recovery and enhance social equity, through the use of new technologies and the creation of new industries and new jobs”. Mike Bloomberg, the C40 board president and a former mayor of New York City, said: “This taskforce is committed to helping city leaders as they work on economic recovery in ways that lead us forward into the future, not back into the past. The principles we’ve outlined will guide our efforts to develop a new normal – one that is greener, healthier, and more prosperous for everyone.”"
"**India's economy has contracted for a second successive quarter, plunging the country into recession. Will improving car sales, a marker of growth, help drive a modest rebound in the near future? Nidhi Rai reports.**
Ashwin Arya recently bought a brand new Toyota Glanza for his family. The 30-year-old, who lives in Betuk, a town in Madhya Pradesh state, bought the car in June, when most of India was still shut after the world's longest coronavirus lockdown.
""My father had met with an accident and we desperately needed a car,"" Mr Arya said.
Mr Arya says the family had planned to buy a new vehicle even before the pandemic struck. But his father's accident hastened the purchase.
""My father has to go to work everyday. My mother and sister also use it for their daily activities. We needed a car for basic mobility as public transport is not good in Betul.""
On the back of such buying by customers like Mr Arya, the Indian automobiles sector, which contributes 7% to the country's Gross Domestic Product or GDP, recorded a good month in October. It's a small sign of hope for the Indian economy, which has now recorded two successive quarters of negative growth.
Many economists expect the economy to return to expansion mode as early as the December quarter if the pickup sustains. Some experts say the latest contraction - 7.5% - is still a positive sign, compared to the previous quarter's figure, 23.9%. Their optimism is backed by improving car sales and services sector performance as Covid case numbers fall and the promise of a vaccine grows.
Retail sales of automobiles in October 2020 were up by 5.1% compared to the previous month, according to Care Ratings. But they were still down by 23.9% compared to last year.
One reason for the slight improvement, experts believe, is pent-up demand. This also coincided with the festive season - the Hindus festivals of Dussehra and Diwali, which spur a lot of buying, account for 35-40% of total sales of the year.
The complete shutdown of public transport during the lockdown also created an urgency for private vehicles, prompting some people to buy them in case of another lockdown. And there are also first-time buyers who probably prefer not to use public transport or ride-hailing apps for fear of catching the virus.
""I think everyone is concerned with safety and therefore they prefer their own vehicle,"" says Abhishek Jain, who runs a used car store in Mumbai city.
But, much like other sectors in the economy, the sluggish growth in the auto sector too can't be entirely blamed on the coronavirus.
It has been in a slump since 2019 because of new emission standards, rising fuel charges, higher interest rates on loans and an overall slowdown in the economy.
In the last two years, more than 300 dealerships across the country have shut, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
""I don't know if we are back on our feet - we are looking at things on a month-on-month basis,"" says Vikram Kirloskar, vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, India's fourth-largest car maker.
""Our order book is looking good. But we cannot plan for three months down the line.""
It also depends on the overall economy, says Manohar Bhat, vice president of sales and marketing at Kia Motors India. That is, if the economy starts growing again, people feel confident and spend money.
""If people feel rich, they will buy vehicles. So commenting on the future is going to be difficult as we all know that the economy is not doing well and will not do well in the next year,"" he said.
Although retailers expect pent-up demand from earlier in the year to be spread across the next six months, they are sceptical of any significant uptick.
Experts also agree that the current rebound may be deceptive. And auto makers believe sales are bound to fall steeply next year.
""I am not very hopeful,"" Vinkesh Gulati, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, said.
""Whatever positive [signs] we have seen, they will not continue. January onwards things are not looking good as of now."""
"The climate crisis will make insurance unaffordable for many people, particularly those in regional areas, as the damage from extreme weather events increases, a consumer group has warned. In a submission to the royal commission into natural disasters sparked by last summer’s unprecedented bushfires, the Consumer Action Law Centre calls for an urgent independent inquiry into the cost of insurance in light of heightened risks linked to global heating.  The group’s recommendations include the introduction of an insurance price monitor to prevent consumers being exploited, a standard definition of key terms such as “fire” in industry contracts and a modernised regime of what “standard cover” means so policies can be easily understood and compared. Gerard Brody, the Consumer Action Law Centre’s chief executive, said there was a risk home insurance could become unaffordable in the wake of last bushfire season, leaving many uninsured or under-insured. He said the issue had been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as many people affected by bushfires in regional communities later lost the income they relied on from tourism and hospitality. “Insurance promises to offer peace of mind, but with delayed claims, confusing policies that don’t always provide the expected coverage and woeful responses to financial hardship by the insurance industry we’re concerned that home insurance still isn’t working for many people,” Brody said. The law centre’s call follows similar warnings elsewhere. Murich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, last year told the Guardian that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable as it attributed US$24bn of losses from the Californian wildfires on human-induced heating. In October, the Reserve Bank of Australia found it was increasingly important that investors and institutions manage carbon risk, and warned insurers were the most directly exposed to climate change. It said inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters were more than twice as large last decade as the one before, and was likely to continue to grow. The Consumer Action Law Centre said since the summer bushfires it had received reports from community organisations in regional areas of significant delays in insurers undertaking assessments or arranging quotes for bushfire damage in remote parts of Victoria. It said problems spanned different types of natural disaster, citing an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into insurance in northern Australia that found premiums had increased far more in that part of the country than elsewhere over the previous decade after insurers adopted a more fine-grained assessment of the greater risk in the north from cyclones and floods. The group said rising costs were increasingly being worn by people who needed insurance most, when historically risk had been shared across the community. “We have significant concerns about how this will play out as the impact of climate change worsens, particularly for regional parts of Australia where climate change means bushfires will be more frequent and more severe,” Brody said in the centre’s submission to the royal commission. “It was recognised in the letters patent of this royal commission that this is the reality Australia is facing. For Australians who live in areas increasingly at risk from bushfires, premiums are going to continually (and sometimes rapidly) increase. “If homeowners cannot afford to rebuild due to the cost of premiums or the impacts of underinsurance, then they will be forced to leave their community.” Consumer Action’s recommendations include the government introducing outstanding recommendations from the banking royal commission relating to insurance as a matter of urgency to ensure people were treated fairly. Submissions to the natural disasters royal commission close on Tuesday. A final report is due in August."

Paul Bongiorno submits this story:
Mr. Watts and company,
Good day Sir. I’d received a response from the UK’s Press Complaint’s Commission regarding the UK’s ‘Guardian’ story of, ‘Peter Gleick cleared of forging..’ fiction.
The ‘PCC’s Simon Yip forwarded me the following:

============================================================
The concerns you have raised relate directly to the Pacific Institute Board of Directors. Given the nature of the story, it appears that it would be difficult for the Commission to investigate or understand this matter fully without the involvement of the organisation in question. In addition, the outcome of a Commission investigation (whether correction, apology or adjudication, for example) would need their approval. In such circumstances, we would generally require a complaint from the subject of the article, in order to take the matter forward.
We recognise, however, that the concerns you have raised are significant. Therefore, in the first instance, we will attempt to contact the Pacific Institute Board of Directors to make them aware of our services and the fact that we have been alerted to this coverage as a possible concern. We will endeavour to keep you updated on the outcome, but I should make clear that these approaches frequently take some time to result in a decision whether or not to take forward a complaint, so it may not be possible in this case to revert to you.
You are most welcome to contact us if you would like to follow up on it.
With best wishes
Yours sincerely
Simon Yip

The speculation is that Goldenberg got some inside information from somebody privy to the “independent investigation” commissioned by the Pacific Institute and then jumped the gun with it just like she did with the original Fakegate story.
Sounds to me like another bought and paid for bucket of whitewash of the Muir-Russell brand.

"The shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says if the Morrison government is serious about kickstarting the economy after the coronavirus, it will seek bipartisan agreement with Labor on a new energy policy, and end the decade long climate wars. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics podcast, Chalmers says Labor was prepared to end the “decade-long barney” in the last parliament by supporting the national energy guarantee to “get some certainty in the system”.  He said that mechanism allowed the major parties to bridge their long running disagreement about how quickly Australia should reduce emissions “because at some point in the future Labor could dial up the ambition, and the Coalition theoretically could dial down the ambition at some future point”. With the government flagging a program of reforms to boost growth as part of the recovery post-Covid-19, Chalmers said energy was the obvious place to start. “If they are serious about getting the economy going again, if they are serious about revisiting some of those things they’ve rejected before – remembering that the last architect of an energy policy is now the treasurer – for all those reasons I think it would be worth seeing if something is possible.” A leading Australian business organisation, the AiGroup, has recently called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying that would boost economic growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments. “Anybody who looks at our economy objectively and thinks about what will be the source of growth after this crisis clearly thinks that industry needs to have cheaper and cleaner energy,” Chalmers said. “We need to get that skills mix, the R&D commercialisation side – all of those things – they will be the key to the future.” “I guess what I am relaying is what business says to me … business can’t understand why we can’t get a resolution on energy, and if you think about our challenges on growth, employment and wages, then I think any serious objective observer would say energy has got to be part [of post-Covid recovery].” Chalmers said it “remains to be seen” whether the major parties could come to terms but he said Labor’s attitude towards the national energy guarantee indicated “there were compromises Labor was prepared to make to get some kind of certainty in the system so business could invest with confidence”. In a wide-ranging conversation, Chalmers also flagged Labor would look to develop policies during the current parliamentary term that recognised that unemployment was likely to remain elevated in Australia after the worst of the coronavirus economic shock had passed. New figures released this week show the jobless rate in Australia has hit the highest level since September 2015, with seasonally adjusted employment falling by 594,300 in April. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said around 2.7 million people, or one in every five person employed in March, either left employment, or had their hours reduced between March and April. Chalmers said there was a problem with demand in the economy and there was also a problem that the unemployment benefit was too low. The shadow treasurer said he was not an advocate of universal basic income as a concept. Universal basic income provides all citizens with a cash payment, replacing traditional welfare systems. But Chalmers said there was clearly a need to “rethink whether the social safety net is stitched together robustly enough to deal with crises like [Covid-19] and the aftermath of crises like this”. He said reference points for that conversation would be job guarantees, or labour market programs like Working Nation – a labour market program from the Keating era. Chalmers said there was an “appetite” for a place-based labour market program “where we recognise for young people in particular, they may be unemployed for longer, and we need to think in innovative ways how we employ these people”. He said central to his thinking was the need to avoid “inter-generational carnage” after an economic downturn. “I think a first world, first rate, wealthy country like ours shouldn’t have disadvantage cascade through the generations.” Chalmers said he was particularly concerned about workers aged over 55 and young people becoming detached from the labour market."
"How can animals, from ants to people, form social groups with individuals working successfully together for a common good? So Charles Darwin asked in 1859, perceiving the existence of cooperative behaviour as a threat to his theory of evolution. Such behaviour remains one of the biggest unanswered questions in science – one that our study, published in Ecology Letters, set out to answer with the help of a highly social bird, the sociable weaver. It’s easy to see why animals should behave selfishly: if you are to pass on your genes to the next generation you should aim to look after yourself, protect your resources, find a mate and reproduce – why would you care about others? As a result of such selfish interests conflict is rife in nature. But what is less well known is that cooperation is also widespread and can be observed at almost any level of biological organisation.  There has been much progress since Darwin, and we now understand a great deal more about how animals may benefit from working together. Although several important theories have been developed and tested over the past decades, kin selection theory has perhaps caused the greatest advance in our understanding of cooperation in animals. Introduced by Bill Hamilton in the 1960s it states that if an individual cooperates with its relatives, this individual may indirectly pass on its genes to the next generation. This is now generally accepted as the main explanation behind cooperation at the family level.  Cooperation, however, can be observed at a much larger scale, with large social groups working successfully together to construct and maintain a common good outside the context of breeding. How kin selection might promote such large social groups is much less straightforward, due to the usually low average levels of relatedness and the social dilemmas faced by individuals within those group. A well-known and widespread social dilemma is a phenomenon called the tragedy of the commons.  Under the tragedy of the commons, social benefits are highest in groups that cooperate, but selfish individuals do better within cooperative groups. If selfishness prevailed, public goods would become over-exploited and society would collapse. Examples from human society include over-exploitation of fish stocks, our failure to efficiently deal with climate change, and the collapse of the society of the original inhabitants of Easter Island. How do animals avoid such collapse and manage to keep freeloaders at bay? To find out, our research team at the University of Sheffield, led by Professor Ben Hatchwell, turned to sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) as a model system. This small passerine bird is extremely social and builds the largest nest of any bird – communally housing hundreds of individuals, weighing more than a tonne, and lasting for decades.  Their massive nest consists of individual nest chambers embedded within a communal thatch. The latter requires separate investment from the colony members and does not emerge from investment in the individual nest chambers. By studying the thatch we can investigate how the birds work together to maintain their public good. After detailed observations of their behaviour and tests to reveal the genetic relationships among the colony members, we found the birds contributing to thatch building did so above their own nest chamber. This indicates self-directed thatch building. However, we also found that these thatchers’ neighbours were often relatives, and that as they also benefited this suggests the thatch-building might be directed towards kin. In trying to corroborate that idea, we found that relatedness to near neighbours predicted thatch building: the more related an individual is to its neighbours, the more likely it is to contribute to the communal good.  Finally, we found related individuals tend to share the use of nest chambers and thus share the benefits of their communal investment among relatives. So these sociable birds benefit from having good neighbours, and from maintaining healthy family relationships – a lesson to us all, no doubt. Despite low relatedness at colony level, social organisation of relatives within the colony leads to communal investment being enjoyed by relatives, as well as contributing to the overall thatch important for the nest as a whole. This is the first study to show that kin selection may encourage the animal effort required to communally build and maintain a structure, and as such it may be relevant to the many other species that build some sort of structure. However, for that most cooperative of species, humans, the mechanism our study revealed is unlikely to apply directly.  Other solutions to the problem of cooperation exist, such as the enforcement of laws and agreements. Perhaps it is these we must turn to – the enforcement of sustainable fishing practices, for example – to ensure the tragedy of the commons is not replicated on a global scale."

"**NI's Education Minister has again dismissed speculation that schools will close early for the Christmas break.**
Peter Weir said despite dismissing the possibility of an extended Christmas break earlier this month ""there continue to be widespread rumours about this matter"".
He described the ongoing rumours as ""disappointing"".
""I will once again stress that there are no plans to extend the Christmas holidays for schools,"" Mr Weir said.
Mr Weir first addressed speculation on 17 November.
""I believe this would only cause further disruption to children's education and lead to an increase in levels of stress and anxiety,"" he added.
Mr Weir said an extended Christmas break could lead to a greater spread of the virus.
""I strongly believe that face-to-face teaching is the best form of education and our schools are the best place to provide this in a controlled and safe environment.
""Indeed, large numbers of young people socialising out of school has the potential to create a major public health concern,"" he said.
His priority, he added, is to ""guard children's education, mental health and well-being"".
Schools in Northern Ireland are due to be closed between 22 December and 4 January."
"The dread that many people are feeling these days about the coronavirus is nothing new to those acquainted with climate grief. As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable. In his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. MH: Let’s be clear – in those clinical trials, terminally ill patients took psychedelic drugs under close medical supervision, right? But the results sound remarkable MP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted. MH: Do those experiences and your other research suggest that psychedelic drugs can be an antidote to climate grief? MP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work. MH: How did that reset happen? MP: I can’t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is [help] people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected – more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who’d been working on this issue a long time. They’ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they’re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression. MH: If ‘antidote’ is too strong, would ‘treatment’ be a better word? MP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment. MH: But climate grief is different in important ways from an individual facing a terminal diagnosis. Climate grief is not necessarily about your own death but more about the death of the world around you – a kind of collective, civilizational death MP: Yeah, and here’s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist! MH: Are psychedelics relevant to climate grief in any other ways? MP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called “nature connectedness” – the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of “nature connectedness” went up consistently and fairly dramatically. This rings true to me and to many of the people I’ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there’s a single subject – you – while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis – our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has – at least theoretically – the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that. MH: You’re a parent. I’m a parent; my daughter just turned 15. A big part of my climate grief relates to the future she’s going to inherit. And not just her but the countless other kids around the world in her generation. Can psychedelics be helpful to parents dealing with climate grief? MP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There’s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there’s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill. MH: I’ve covered climate change as a journalist for 30 years, and when people ask, I always say that the only solution to climate grief for me is taking action – doing something to make me feel I’m having an effect on this. Taking action is clearly a climate solution. Are psychedelic drugs, in a different way, also a climate solution? MP: No, I wouldn’t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices – giving up meat, for example – is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics … But what’s exciting and new is that we’re coming to recognize psychedelics’ therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.

The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of economic expansion, and state government budgets are benefiting from a solid growth in tax revenues. State general fund revenues have grown 40 percent since 2010. Many of the nation’s governors have used the growing revenues to expand spending programs, whereas others have pursued reductions in taxes.



That is the backdrop to this year’s 14th biennial fiscal report card on the governors, which examines state budget actions since 2016. It uses statistical data to grade the governors on their taxing and spending records — governors who have cut taxes and spending the most receive the highest grades, whereas those who have increased taxes and spending the most receive the lowest grades.



Five governors were awarded an A on this report: Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Doug Burgum of North Dakota, Paul LePage of Maine, and Greg Abbott of Texas. Eight governors were awarded an F: Roy Cooper of North Carolina, John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, Jim Justice of West Virginia, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, David Ige of Hawaii, Kate Brown of Oregon, and Jay Inslee of Washington.



Governors of every state are having their fiscal choices shaped by the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. State income tax bases are tied to the federal tax base, so gover‐ nors have been considering which federal changes to conform to. Also, the capping of the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes has increased the bite of those taxes for millions of households. The cap has increased the relative burden of living in a high‐​tax state, and it may induce higher out‐​migration from those states over time.



The state fiscal environment is also being shaped by recent Supreme Court decisions regarding online sales taxes and public‐​sector labor unions. Furthermore, the legalization of marijuana has created a new source of revenue for some states.



This report discusses these fiscal policy developments and examines the tax and spending actions of each governor in detail. The hope is that the report encourages more state policymakers to adopt the fiscal approaches of the top‐​scoring governors.



Governors play a key role in state fiscal policy. They propose budgets, recommend tax changes, and sign or veto tax and spending bills. When the economy is growing, governors can use rising revenues to expand programs, or they can return extra revenues to citizens through tax cuts. When the economy is stagnant, governors can raise taxes to close budget gaps, or they can trim spending.



This report grades governors on their fiscal policies from a limited-government perspective. Governors receiving an A are those who have cut taxes and spending the most, whereas governors receiving an F have raised taxes and spending the most. The grading mechanism is based on seven variables, including two spending variables, one revenue variable, and four tax-rate variables. The same methodology has been used on Cato’s fiscal report cards since 2008.



The results are data-driven. They account for tax and spending actions that affect short-term budgets in the states. However, they do not account for longer-term or structural changes that governors may make, such as reforms to state pension plans. Thus, the results provide one measure of how fiscally conservative each governor is, but they do not reflect all the fiscal actions that governors make.



Tax and spending data for the report come from the National Association of State Budget Officers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Tax Foundation, the budget agencies of each state, and news articles in _State Tax Notes_ and other sources. The data cover the period January 2016 through August 2018, which was a time of budget expansion in most states.1 The report rates 43 governors. It excludes the governors of Alabama, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, and Virginia because of their short time in office, and it excludes Alaska’s governor because of the peculiarities of that state’s budget.



The following section discusses the highest-scoring governors and the differences between governors of the two political parties. The section after that looks at recent developments that have affected state fiscal policy, including the 2017 federal tax law, recent Supreme Court rulings, and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Appendix A discusses the report card’s methodology. Appendix B provides summaries of the fiscal records of the 43 governors included in the report.



Table 1 presents the overall grades for the governors. Scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for each governor based on seven tax and spending variables. Scores closer to 100 indicate governors who favored smaller-government policies. The numerical scores were converted to the letter grades A to F.



 **Table 1: Overall grades for the governors**





The following five governors received grades of A:



All the governors receiving a grade of A in this year’s report are Republicans, and six of the eight governors receiving an F are Democrats. There have been some high-scoring Democrats on past Cato report cards, but Republican governors tend to focus their agendas more on tax and spending cuts than do Democrats.



This Cato report has used the same grading method since 2008. In that year, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 55 and 46, respectively. In 2010, their average scores were 55 and 47; in 2012, 57 and 43; in 2014, 57 and 42; and in 2016, 54 and 43.



That pattern continues in the 2018 report. This time, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 55 and 41, respectively. Republicans received higher scores than Democrats, on average, on both spending and taxes, although the Republican advantage on taxes was greater than on spending.



When states develop budget gaps, Democratic governors often pursue tax increases to balance the budget, while Republicans focus on spending restraint. When the economy is growing and state coffers are filling up, Democrats tend to increase spending, while Republicans tend to both increase spending and pursue tax cuts.



Figure 1 shows state general fund spending since 2000, based on data from the National Association of State Budget Officers.3 Spending soared between 2002 and 2008 and then fell during the recession as states cut their budgets. Since then, spending has bounced back strongly and has grown at an average annual rate of 3.7 percent since 2010.



 **Figure 1: State general fund spending**





Education is the largest area of state spending. It accounts for 30 percent of total state budgets, with about two-thirds of the spending going toward K–12 schools and one-third going toward higher education.4 Over the most recent five years of data, state-funded K–12 spending grew at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent.5



The other key driver of state budgets is Medicaid, which is funded jointly by federal and state taxpayers. This giant program pays for the health care and long-term care of 75 million people.6 Medicaid accounts for 29 percent of total state spending. State-funded Medicaid spending grew by 6.0 percent in 2015, 4.1 percent in 2016, 7.8 percent in 2017, and about 7.3 percent in 2018.7



On the revenue side of budgets, states enacted overall net tax cuts in 2014 and 2015 but swung to net tax increases in 2016, 2017, and 2018.8 Cigarette and gasoline tax increases have been pursued by both Democratic and Republican governors. Since 2015, 16 states have enacted cigarette tax increases and 19 states have enacted gas tax increases.9 By contrast, income tax policy divides the parties, with many Democrats supporting increases and Republicans supporting decreases.



The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cut individual and corporate income tax rates, but it also changed individual and corporate tax bases. Those base changes affected state tax systems because nearly every state with an income tax conforms to the federal income tax base to some extent.10



The states are about evenly split between those that automatically conform to federal tax changes (“rolling conformity”) and those that occasionally pass legislation to conform to the federal code that exists at a particular date (“fixed conformity”). There are also a few states that update their tax bases selectively, choosing to conform to only some parts of the federal tax code.



In most states, individuals start their state income tax calculations with federal adjusted gross income (AGI). In other states, individuals start with federal taxable income or a state-specific measure of income. Consider the expansion of standard deductions and the elimination of personal exemptions under the 2017 federal tax law. Those changes altered state tax bases in those states that start with federal taxable income and in states that use federal definitions of deductions and exemptions.



Other federal tax changes altered state tax calculations for itemized deductions, child credits, small business capital expensing, and other items. The new federal deduction for pass-through businesses will affect the tax bases of states that conform to federal taxable income. Other states will have to decide whether to add this new deduction to their codes.



All in all, the 2017 federal tax reform generally broadened state tax bases and thus boosted state tax revenues. In recent months, governors and state legislatures have wrangled over how much of the increased state revenues to return to taxpayers.



South Carolina’s situation is representative of that faced by many states. A state report noted that if “the state doesn’t take action to account for the federal changes, South Carolina would receive a few million dollars more in income tax revenue but, by default, create a duplicative tax system that would likely be a nightmare to tax filers. Meanwhile if legislators decide to conform to federal reform without making major changes to the state’s tax code, South Carolina could generate a whopping $200 million in extra revenue. . . . Yet another option would be for the state to conform to the federal code and make changes to the state’s tax code to offset the extra revenue.”11



As a fixed conformity state, if South Carolina does not respond to the federal change, taxpayers will deal with new tax rules that differ between their federal and state returns. A second option would be for South Carolina to pass legislation simply conforming to the federal law, but that would result in a large state tax increase. A third option would be to pass legislation conforming to federal law but also cutting state taxes. That approach is favored by South Carolina’s governor, Henry McMaster, but he and the legislature have not yet agreed on a plan to do so.12



Other states have pursued different paths. The best response has been from states that have conformed to the federal law but cut state income tax rates to hold taxpayers harmless, such as Idaho and Georgia. Idaho, for example, conformed to the federal tax law, which raised the state’s taxes by about $100 million a year, but Governor Butch Otter more than offset that increase by signing legislation that cut individual and corporate income tax rates and saved taxpayers about $200 million.13 Other states, such as Michigan and Nebraska, offset the tax-increasing effect of the 2017 federal tax law with state tax base adjustments rather than tax rate cuts. Still other states conformed to the federal law and pocketed the extra cash rather than giving it back to taxpayers. Colorado, for example, will pocket at least $200 million a year in extra state tax revenue and state policymakers plan to spend it.14



The government workforce is heavily unionized. In 2017, 36 percent of state and local government workers were members of labor unions, which was five times the private-sector share of 7 percent.15 About two-thirds of government education workers are members of unions.16



The union share in state and local government workforces varies widely, from less than 10 percent in North Carolina to about 70 percent in New York.17 Union shares are correlated with state rules regarding collective bargaining. Three-quarters or more of the states have collective bargaining for at least some state and local workers. But North Carolina, Virginia, and some other states ban collective bargaining in the public sector.



Public-sector union shares are also correlated with “agency shop” rules. These rules require workers to either join their workplace union or pay the union an agency fee. In 2018, 23 states were agency-shop states, and 27 states were right-to-work states, where workers cannot be forced to join a union or pay union fees.18 Right-to-work states generally have lower union shares in their workforces.



Union rules for public employees changed in June 2018 when the U.S. Supreme Court decided _Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees_ (AFSCME). In that case, the court found that public employees cannot be forced to pay agency fees as a condition of their employment.



This ruling will weaken unions in state and local governments. The _New York Times_ predicted that public-sector unions “are going to get smaller and poorer in the coming years” and cited experts who expect membership to shrink by 10 to 30 percent. As the _Times_ noted, “in the five years after Michigan passed a law ending mandatory union fees in 2012, the number of active members of the Michigan Education Association dropped by about 25 percent.”19



A drop in union membership would improve government finances because lawmakers would have more flexibility to restrain costs and improve state efficiencies. Unions tend to use their political power to push for higher wages and benefits. On average, public-sector unions increase compensation levels for their members by about 8 percent.20 When he was running for governor of Illinois in 2002, Rod Blagojevich apparently promised AFSCME large wage increases for their members if he was elected in return for their support on his campaign.21



Unions reduce government efficiency in other ways. Unions tend to protect poorly performing workers, they often push for larger staffing levels than are required, and they discourage the use of volunteers in government activities. They also tend to resist the introduction of new technologies and to create more rule-laden workplaces.



In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker signed into law public-sector union reforms in 2011. These reforms imposed restrictions on collective bargaining, including rules requiring that unions be recertified every year. Walker also signed legislation in 2015 making Wisconsin a right-to-work state. In response, the share of Wisconsin’s public-sector workers who belong to unions plunged from 50 percent in 2011 to 19 percent in 2017.22 With the _Janus_ ruling, we may see similarly large drops in union membership in other states.



Before a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2018, businesses were generally not required to collect online sales taxes for a state unless they had a physical presence in that state. That approach limited online taxation and allowed e-commerce to boom over the past two decades.



Prior to the ruling, large businesses with physical property or employees in many states, such as Amazon, collected online sales taxes, but the physical presence rule shielded smaller businesses from the compliance burden of collecting all the different sales taxes across all the states that their customers lived in. There are more than 10,000 state and local jurisdictions in United States that impose sales taxes.



The 2018 Court decision, _South Dakota v. Wayfair_ , overturned the physical presence rule and opened the door to broader online taxation.23 In the decision, the court identified features of South Dakota’s online tax approach that it viewed favorably. South Dakota’s law exempts small online retailers whose revenue from South Dakota falls below a certain threshold and who complete fewer than a certain number of transactions in the state. And South Dakota has a single state-level administrator of sales taxes and fairly uniform sales tax bases and rates statewide. In response to the Supreme Court’s approval of South Dakota’s approach, many other states are modifying their online sales tax efforts to conform to it.



Some analysts fear, however, that the _Wayfair_ decision will lead to a “wild west” of states aggressively expanding their taxation beyond their borders.24 In turn, that would advantage larger online businesses over smaller ones.25 Even when the physical presence standard held, many states stretched it with a patchwork of tax rules tied to computer cookies, airport stopovers, and other dubious measures of presence. The _Wayfair_ decision may encourage states to adopt simpler approaches to taxing online commerce, but we will have to see.



The _Wayfair_ decision has caused consternation among the five states that do not impose statewide retail sales taxes. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu issued a press release declaring that the state “will erect every possible and constitutionally permissible legal and procedural hurdle to prevent other states from forcing our businesses to collect sales and use taxes. . . . We will send a message to every out-of-state taxing jurisdiction and authority. If you try to come into our state and force our businesses to collect a sales tax in a manner that violates our laws or the United States Constitution, you will be in for the fight of your life.”26 Montana officials are also concerned about the Supreme Court decision.27 One Montana newspaper said that the ruling “will create a huge and expensive burden for small and medium-size Montana businesses that sell online but don’t have the capacity or financial ability to track and collect sales taxes.28



Online sales are still less than 10 percent of all retail sales, so there is no desperate need for states to grab more revenue in this manner.29 About half of all e-commerce is already taxed. Uncollected e-commerce taxes are, at most, $13 billion nationally, which is only about 4 percent of total U.S. sales tax collections.30



Despite the rise of online sales, sales tax revenue has kept pace with the growth of the economy over the past three decades. General sales tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product have dipped only slightly, from 2.1 percent in 1990 to 2.0 percent today.31



States that expand their online sales tax efforts should minimize the compliance burden on businesses by simplifying their sales tax structures. They should also offset the added revenues collected with a reduction in sales or income tax rates.



Recreational marijuana is now legal in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington State, and the District of Columbia. One incentive for states to legalize marijuana is to raise tax revenues. All these jurisdictions except Alaska impose special retail sales taxes on marijuana, ranging from 10 percent in Nevada and Maine to 37 percent in Washington State.32 In addition, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, and Nevada impose taxes on growers. Vermont policymakers have not yet settled on tax rates.



In 2017, Colorado raised $247 million from marijuana taxes, Washington State raised $319 million, and Oregon raised $70 million.33 Cato’s Jeffrey Miron estimates that nationwide legalization could raise about $12 billion for federal, state, and local governments.34



However, we do not know the tax rates in states that may legalize pot in coming years, nor do we know the consumer responses to those taxes. If states set their tax rates too high, a substantial part of consumer demand will continue to be satisfied on the black market. A recent empirical study found that the “medium-run elasticity of demand for marijuana is higher than the consensus estimates for cigarettes or gasoline.”35 Thus, policymakers should take care to keep marijuana tax rates low.



Legalizing recreational marijuana will be on the ballot this November in Michigan, and governors and legislators in many other states are considering legalization. North of the border, recreational marijuana will be legal nationwide in Canada starting in October 2018.



The 2017 federal tax reform law was the largest overhaul of the federal income tax in decades. The law changed deductions, exemptions, and tax rates for individuals while also changing the tax base and rates for businesses.



One key reform was the capping of the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000. That cap, along with the doubling of the standard deduction, will reduce the number of households deducting state and local income, sales, and property taxes from 42 million in 2017 to 17 million in 2018.36 For taxpayers who continue to take the deduction, the average benefit will be much smaller.



Before this change in the law, federal deductibility effectively subsidized high-tax states and encouraged them to load taxes onto high earners. It also encouraged government expansion. As the Congressional Budget Office noted of the SALT deduction, “Because of the subsidy, too many [government] services may be supplied, and state and local governments may be bigger as a result.”37



With the capping of the deduction, millions of households will feel a larger bite from state and local taxes, and thus become more sensitive to tax differences between the states. The tax law may increase the outflow of mainly higher-income households from high-tax states to low-tax states. The states where SALT deductions were the largest relative to incomes were high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey, and California.38



If high earners move out of high-tax states in substantial numbers, it would be a blow to state revenues. In New York, the top 1 percent of earners pay 41 percent of state income taxes, and in New Jersey the share is 37 percent.39 In California, the top 1 percent pay a remarkable 50 percent of state income taxes.40



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes data showing the interstate movements of tax-filing households.41 The data show that 2.8 percent of households moved between states in 2016. There are an average 2.1 people per household in the IRS data.42



Some states gain residents from interstate migration, and some states lose them. The largest loser from interstate migration is New York. In 2016, it lost 218,937 households to other states and gained 142,722 households from other states, for a net loss of 76,215. The other states with the largest net migration losses were Illinois (41,965 households); New Jersey (25,941); California (25,913); Pennsylvania (19,516); Massachusetts (14,549); Ohio (13,254); Connecticut (12,254); Maryland (12,068); and Michigan (10,325).



Where did those domestic migrants go? The largest net inflows were to Florida (95,072 households); Washington State (30,480); North Carolina (25,601); Colorado (24,672); Arizona (24,211); Oregon (21,729); Texas (19,414); South Carolina (18,519); Georgia (17,798); and Nevada (14,236). These 2016 migration flows generally reflect extended trends. New York has been losing residents to other states for decades, while Florida has been gaining residents for decades.



Each state’s attractiveness can be measured by the ratio of gross inflows to gross outflows. States losing population have ratios less than 1.0, whereas states gaining population have ratios greater than 1.0. New York’s ratio was 0.65 in 2016, meaning that for every 100 households that left the state, only 65 households moved in. Florida’s ratio was 1.45, meaning that 145 households moved in for every 100 that left.



Even before the new federal tax law, Americans tended to move from higher-tax states to lower-tax states. Looking at the 2016 migration flows, 286,431 households (consisting of 578,269 people) moved, on net, from the 25 highest-tax states and the District of Columbia to the 25 lowest-tax states in that single year. Taxes are measured as state and local sales, property, and individual income taxes as a percentage of personal income.43



Figure 2 plots state migration ratios on the vertical axis and state tax ratios on the horizontal axis. The figure shows a clear negative relationship between migration ratios and tax levels. On the left, states have lower taxes and net in-migration (a ratio greater than 1.0). On the right, states have higher taxes and net out-migration (a ratio less than 1.0).



 **Figure 2: Tax levels and net migration ratios, 2016**





Of the 25 highest-tax states, 24 had net out-migration. Of the 25 lowest-tax states, 17 had net in-migration. The figure includes a fitted regression line that shows the correlation between interstate migration and tax levels.44



Interstate migration is influenced by many factors other than taxes, including job opportunities, housing costs, and climate. Experts disagree on how large a role taxes play in migration, but that role will certainly increase under the 2017 federal tax law. A recent Cato Institute study explored these relationships in more detail.45



The new federal tax law has ushered in an era of increased interstate tax competition. Governors should rethink their tax codes with an eye to retaining and attracting residents and businesses. They should consider how to reduce tax rates and improve the efficiency of their state’s public services to give their taxpayers more value for their money.



This study computes a fiscal policy grade for each governor based on his or her success at restraining taxes and spending since 2016, or since 2017 for governors who entered office in that year. The spending data used in this study come from the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) and, in some cases, from the budget documents of individual states. The data on proposed and enacted tax cuts come from NASBO, the National Conference of State Legislatures, news articles in _State Tax Notes_ , and many other sources.46 Tax-rate data come from the Tax Foundation and other sources.



This year’s report uses the same methodology as the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 Cato fiscal policy reports. The report focuses on short-term taxing and spending actions to judge whether the governors take a small-government or a big-government approach to fiscal policy. Each governor’s performance is measured using seven variables: two for spending, one for revenue, and four for tax rates. Their overall score is calculated as the average of their scores in these three categories. Tables A.1 and A.2 summarize the governors’ scores.



 **Table A.1: Spending and revenue changes**





The two spending variables are measured on a per capita basis to adjust for state populations that are growing at different rates. Also, the spending variables measure only the changes in general fund budgets, which are the budgets that governors have the most control over. Variable 1 is measured through fiscal 2019, and variable 2 is measured through fiscal 2018. Variables 3 through 7 cover changes from January 2016 to August 2018, or from January 2017 to August 2018, for governors who entered office in 2017.



For each variable, the results are standardized so that the worst scores fall near zero and the best scores fall near 100. The scores for each of the three categories — spending, revenue, and tax rates — are calculated as the average score of the variables within the category, with one exception: the cigarette tax rate variable is quarter-weighted because that tax is a smaller source of state revenue than the other taxes measured in its category. The average of the scores for the three categories produces the overall grade for each governor.



This report uses publicly available data to measure the fiscal performance of the state governors. There are, however, some unavoidable problems in such grading. For one, this report card cannot fully isolate the policy effects of the governors from the fiscal decisions of their states’ legislatures. Governors and legislatures both influence tax and spending outcomes, and if a legislature is controlled by a different party, a governor’s control may be diminished. To help isolate the performance of governors, variables 1 and 3 measure the effects of each governor’s proposed, although not necessarily enacted, policies.



Another factor to consider is that the states grant governors differing amounts of authority over budget processes. For example, most governors are empowered with a line-item veto to trim spending, but some governors do not have that power. Another example is that the supermajority voting requirement to override a veto varies among the states. Such factors give governors different levels of budget control that are not accounted for in this study.



Nonetheless, the results presented here should be a good reflection of each governor’s fiscal approach. Governors who received a grade of A have focused on reducing tax burdens and restraining spending. Governors who received a grade of F have pursued government expansion. In the middle are many governors who gyrate between different fiscal approaches from one year to the next.



Below are highlights of the fiscal records of the 43 governors covered in this report. The discussions are based on the tax and spending data used to grade the governors as well as on other information that sheds light on each governor’s fiscal approach.48 Note that the grades are calculated based on each governor’s record since 2016, or since 2017 if that year was the governor’s first in office.



Doug Ducey, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: January 2015



Doug Ducey has a background in business and finance, and before taking office he was the head of Cold Stone Creamery. As governor, he has overseen fairly lean budgets, with general fund spending rising 1.3 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018. In 2016, Ducey approved pension reforms that trimmed benefit costs and gave new hires the option of a defined-contribution pension plan.



When Ducey was running for office, he promised that he would not raise taxes, and he has signed into law some modest tax cuts.49 He has approved legislation to end sales taxes on some business purchases, to reduce insurance premium taxes, to increase depreciation deductions, and to index income tax brackets for inflation.



However, Ducey also signed into law an extension of a temporary sales tax surcharge to fund education.50 The 0.6 percentage point addition to the sales tax rate raises more than $600 million a year. Additionally, Ducey imposed a new car registration charge on Arizonans, which will raise about $149 million a year.51 These actions amount to substantial tax increases.



Arizona voters had been gearing up to make a big decision on taxes on the November 2018 ballot. They were to decide whether to hike the top individual income tax rate by 4.46 percentage points to fund more school spending. However, the Arizona Supreme Court shot down the measure on technical grounds in late August.52



Asa Hutchinson, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: January 2015



Former U.S. congressman and federal official Asa Hutchinson entered the Arkansas governor’s office in 2015. Hutchinson campaigned on a middle-class tax cut, which he delivered soon after taking office. He signed into law reduced tax rates for households with annual incomes of less than $75,000, which has saved them about $90 million a year. As the governor said, “Arkansas has been an island of high taxation for too long, and I’m pleased that we are doing something about that.”53



In 2017, Hutchinson approved a further $50 million in tax cuts, primarily for moderate-income individuals.54 And in 2018, as a task force was considering major tax reform, Hutchinson proposed cutting the top individual income tax rate from 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent. He would offset the lost revenue with budget surpluses and the closure of narrow tax breaks.55



Jerry Brown, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Jerry Brown received poor grades on previous Cato report cards, and he does so again on this one. He scored poorly on both taxes and spending.



California’s general fund budget increased 4.0 percent in 2017 and 6.2 percent in 2018, and it is set to increase 9.2 percent in 2019.56 Under Brown, the state’s general fund budget rose 52 percent between 2011 and the enacted amount for 2019. State government employment has risen 12 percent since 2013.57



Perhaps Brown’s most wasteful spending is on the state’s high-speed rail project, which despite its high cost will do little to relieve congestion. The projected cost of the project has soared from $33 billion to $77 billion, and officials admit it could rise to $98 billion.58 And those are just the capital costs: taxpayers will also be hit by a share of the project’s operating costs if it is ever completed.59



Brown has been lucky in that revenues have poured into the state’s coffers from growth in Silicon Valley in recent years. However, the next recession will cause a crisis for the California budget, as have past recessions. That occurs because spending keeps rising but state tax revenues are very dependent on high earners and capital gains. In California, the top 1 percent of earners pay 50 percent of all state income taxes, but their tax payments are highly variable.60



Despite the recent surge in state revenues, Brown and the legislature keep piling on more taxes. In 2017, Brown approved a transportation funding bill that raised taxes by $5 billion a year.61 The law increased the state’s gasoline tax by 12 cents per gallon and the diesel tax by 20 cents per gallon. It also imposed a new annual fee on all vehicles. However, voters will have a chance to repeal the new fuel and vehicle taxes on this November’s ballot by approving Proposition 6, the result of a petition that garnered more than 900,000 signatures.



It will be interesting to see which way voters go. In 2016, voters approved Proposition 56, which increased cigarette taxes by $2 per pack to raise $1.3 billion a year.62 And they approved Proposition 55, which extended the state’s top income tax rates for high earners ranging from 10.3 percent to 13.3 percent.63 The latter rate is the highest in the nation.



According to the _Los Angeles Times_ , “The higher tax rates were first implemented in 2012 when voters approved Proposition 30 during a time of severe budget crisis. Under the measure, those rates were set to expire in 2018. Since [then], the state’s revenues have improved dramatically, but Gov. Jerry Brown warned of future deficits unless Proposition 55 was approved.”64 With the growing economy of recent years, any risk of deficits stems from fast-growing spending, not from a shortage of revenue.



In 2017, Brown pushed a bill through the legislature to extend California’s cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions.65 The system was implemented in 2012 and amounts to a large tax on Californians. Limits on emissions impose costs on businesses and consumers through higher prices on energy and other products.66 The system, for example, is expected to increase gasoline prices from 15 cents to 63 cents per gallon by 2021.67



Auctions of emissions permits raise revenue for California’s “Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” which spends money on a range of politically favored projects, including Brown’s high-speed rail system.68 The fund will raise $1.8 billion in revenue in 2018.69



Brown has pushed other taxes in recent years. His administration proposed a new tax on residential and business water meters that would raise about $100 million annually. However, the legislature has not yet acted on that proposal.



John Hickenlooper, Democrat Legislature: Divided



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



John Hickenlooper was an entrepreneur who founded a series of restaurants and brewpubs before entering politics. He first served as mayor of Denver, then was elected governor in 2011. Despite Hickenlooper’s success in business, he has not brought a business emphasis on cost control to the governor’s office.



Under Hickenlooper, general fund spending has ballooned. Spending rose 6.8 percent in 2018 and is expected to rise 7.5 percent in 2019. State government employment has soared under Hickenlooper, rising 16 percent over the past five years.70



Hickenlooper supported a large individual income tax increase on the ballot in 2013, which would have replaced Colorado’s flat-rate 4.63 percent tax with a two-rate structure of 5.0 and 5.9 percent. That increase was rejected by voters by 65 to 35 percent.71



As Colorado’s economy has grown in recent years, revenues have poured into the state’s coffers. A recent story in the _Denver Post_ began, “Colorado’s sunny economic outlook is making it rain tax dollars.”72 Under the state’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), strong revenue growth triggers automatic refunds to taxpayers, and state officials are expecting to issue refunds in the coming years. TABOR is a useful safeguard against government overexpansion, but Hickenlooper wants to change the law so that the state can spend more.73



Colorado will receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year in extra tax revenue as a result of the 2017 federal tax law, and this money will automatically flow into the state’s coffers because it is a rolling conformity state. But rather than using this windfall to reduce state tax rates, the governor and legislature have decided to spend it.74



The state government also has a new source of revenue: marijuana. Citizens legalized it for recreational use on the 2012 ballot. The state is collecting growing amounts of revenue from the product, up to $247 million by 2017.75 Hickenlooper signed a bill raising the marijuana sales tax rate from 10 percent to 15 percent.



Dan Malloy, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Dan Malloy received poor grades on previous Cato report cards because of his large tax increases, and this report tells the same story. In 2011, Malloy raised taxes by $1.8 billion annually. In 2015, he raised taxes by another $900 million annually. He increased the top individual income tax rate and extended a corporate income tax surcharge. He also increased the cigarette tax rate, broadened the bases of the sales and income taxes, and increased health provider taxes.



In 2017, Malloy signed into law increases in cigarette taxes, hospital taxes, and taxes on ridesharing services, as well as on other items, to raise about $400 million annually. In 2018, Malloy proposed raising more than $100 million a year by increasing gasoline taxes.76 He also proposed further increases in cigarette taxes.



Despite all these tax increases, Connecticut faces large budget gaps because of sluggish economic growth. Connecticut’s economy has lagged other states for years, and the state’s high and rising taxes are not helping.77 The state has a troubled fiscal future, with some of the highest debt and unfunded retirement liabilities per capita of any state.



Individuals and businesses have been leaving Connecticut in droves. The state’s interstate migration ratio is 0.74, one of the worst in the nation, which means that 100 households are leaving the state for every 74 households moving in.78 For households that earn more than $200,000 annually, Connecticut has the worst interstate migration ratio in the nation, at 0.48.



John Carney, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2017



John Carney has had a long political career. Before entering office as governor, he was a member of the U.S. Congress, Delaware’s lieutenant governor, and Delaware’s secretary of finance. He also served on the staff of Joe Biden during Biden’s time as a U.S. senator.



In his first year as governor, Carney approved large tax increases. He signed bills raising corporate franchise taxes, realty transfer taxes, alcohol taxes, and cigarette taxes.79 These tax increases will raise more than $200 million annually. Carney also proposed a plan to raise individual income taxes, but that plan was not passed.



However, in a concession to interstate tax competition, Carney signed a repeal of Delaware’s estate tax, which may have been costing the state revenue by encouraging wealthy individuals to flee. As the repeal’s main sponsor, Rep. Mike Ramone, said, “We came to the realization that it was absolutely necessary to do [estate tax repeal] because we were losing more in income tax than what we would gain in estate tax.”80



Rick Scott, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



Governor Rick Scott received an A on Cato’s 2012 and 2016 report cards. Although he was edged out of the top spots on this report, he still scores highly.



Florida’s low taxes and nice climate have made it the largest in-migration state in the nation. People from high-tax states are particularly drawn to Florida by its lack of income and estate taxes. That inflow will likely increase in the wake of the 2017 federal tax law.



Scott has worked to make Florida an attractive destination for people and businesses. In 2012, Scott raised the exemption level for the corporate income tax, eliminating the burden for thousands of small businesses. In 2013, he approved a temporary elimination of sales taxes on manufacturing equipment. In 2014, he signed into law a $400 million cut to vehicle fees.



In 2015, Scott approved a large cut to taxes on communication services and modest reductions in sales and business taxes. In 2016, he proposed more than $900 million in tax relief, including a cut to the sales tax on commercial rents and an exemption for manufacturers and retailers from the corporate income tax.81 The legislature did not approve those proposals but did pass Scott’s plan to eliminate sales taxes on manufacturing equipment.



In 2017, Scott proposed more than $600 million in tax cuts, including a large cut to the tax on commercial leases. The legislature scaled back Scott’s plan and passed a smaller cut to the commercial lease tax.82 In 2018, Scott signed into law another package of cuts, including another cut to the commercial lease tax.



Scott championed, and the legislature passed, a state constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of each chamber to increase taxes. Amendment 5 will need a 60 percent vote on the November 2018 ballot to be added to the state constitution.



Nathan Deal, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



Governor Nathan Deal earned a D on the 2016 Cato report due to his poor performance on both spending and taxes. He did better on this report. State spending has increased fairly briskly, but Deal signed into law major tax reforms in 2018.



In the past, Deal has supported tax increases. He supported a ballot measure in 2012 to increase sales taxes, but voters shot down that plan by a large margin.83 Then, in 2015, Deal signed into law a large increase in gasoline taxes, hotel taxes, and other levies to raise more than $600 million a year.



In recent years, Georgia’s strong economy has filled state coffers with revenues. Also, the 2017 federal tax reform was expected to create a state revenue windfall of about $1 billion a year. Under pressure to offset that windfall, Deal backed legislation in 2018 that cut taxes by more than $1 billion per year when phased in.84 The law doubled standard deductions and reduced the top income tax rate for individuals and businesses from 6 percent to 5.75 percent in 2019 and then to 5.5 percent in 2020.



Deal has signed into law other tax changes. He reduced the ad valorem tax on cars and approved a sales tax exemption for data center equipment. He also approved a remote sellers tax that is expected to raise more than $400 million a year in state and local revenues.



David Ige, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F Took office: December 2014



Before being elected governor of Hawaii, David Ige was a state legislator and a manager in the telecommunications industry. He defeated the previous governor, Neil Abercrombie, in the 2014 Democratic primary. Ige pointed to Abercrombie’s tax increases as one cause of his defeat, but Ige is repeating his predecessor’s misguided high-tax approach.



In 2016, Ige proposed increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees. In 2017, he approved a bill to create a state earned-income tax credit but offset the cost by reinstating higher income tax rates on high earners that had expired in 2015. The state’s top income tax rate jumped from 8.25 percent to 11.0 percent, raising about $50 million a year.85



Ige also approved a bill to raise the state’s hotel room tax and extend a surcharge of the general excise tax, which is similar to a sales tax. These tax hikes, which are expected to raise about $2.4 billion over 13 years, will fund a boondoggle rail transit project that is suffering a large cost overrun.86



C. L. “Butch” Otter, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2007



Former congressman Butch Otter is in his third term as governor of Idaho. He has a fairly pro-growth record on taxes, but state spending has risen quickly in recent years.



In 2012, Otter signed legislation cutting the corporate tax rate from 7.6 to 7.4 percent and the top individual income tax rate from 7.8 to 7.4 percent. In 2015, he proposed cutting income tax rates and ending property taxes on business equipment, but those cuts did not pass.



However, in 2015, Otter approved an increase in the gasoline tax. In 2016, he said he was against the tax cuts that were being considered by the legislature because they would jeopardize his spending priorities.87 And in 2017, Otter vetoed a bill that would have eliminated Idaho’s 6 percent tax on groceries.88



The 2017 federal tax reform bill is projected to provide Idaho with an annual revenue windfall of about $100 million. To his credit, Otter used that opportunity to approve a bill that conformed Idaho’s taxes to the federal tax code while cutting the corporate tax rate and reducing individual income tax rates.89 These cuts will reduce Idaho’s taxes by about $200 million a year.



In 2018, Otter signed a bill to reduce unemployment insurance taxes, which will save Idaho businesses $115 million over three years.90



Otter scores poorly on spending. The general fund budget increased 7.3 percent in 2017 and 5.8 percent in 2018. Spending is expected to increase 5.1 percent in 2019.91



Bruce Rauner, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B Took office: January 2015



Businessman Bruce Rauner took office as Illinois’s governor in 2015 eager to fix his state’s severe fiscal problems. Illinois has large unfunded pension and health care obligations, and its pension and health costs already consume one-quarter of the state budget.92 The state also has about $7 billion in IOUs to businesses that have contracted with the state.93 Illinois bonds are the worst-rated state bonds in the nation. As Moody’s Investor Service said, “Illinois has increasingly become an outlier among the 50 states” for its dire fiscal situation.94



Unfortunately, the state legislature has dug in its heels against Rauner’s proposed fiscal reforms. In a 2017 budget standoff, Rauner agreed to raise income taxes, but only if the tax hikes were temporary and accompanied by other reforms. However, the legislature overrode his veto and passed a budget with no structural reforms that increased the individual income tax rate from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and the corporate tax rate from 5.25 percent to 7 percent.95 Those increases will cost Illinois taxpayers $5 billion a year.



In 2018, Rauner proposed trimming state worker pension and health care costs and using the savings to partly roll back the 2017 tax hikes.96 But the legislature — led by House Speaker Mike Madigan — blocked the reforms. Madigan has been in office for 48 years and has remarkable behind-the-scenes power over House members, Senate members, and the state judiciary.97



The large 2017 tax increases have not solved Illinois’s budget woes, and the state’s budget continues to be structurally imbalanced.98 The legislature is pushing for even higher taxes and wants to replace the state’s flat income tax with a progressive, or multirate, tax. Kristen McQueary, a member of the _Chicago Tribune_ editorial board, recently observed that “Illinois lawmakers want [a multirate tax] today after loading up more than $130 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, $6.4 billion in unpaid bills and structural deficits so profound that the state has the worst credit rating in the nation and became the first in U.S. history to fall to near-junk status.”99



A state constitutional amendment would be needed to enact a multirate income tax, and to pass, that amendment would require a supermajority vote from the legislature and 60 percent approval by the voters.



However, higher taxes would not help Illinois’s economy, which has trailed the national economy for years. Illinois suffers from chronic net out-migration to other states, and _Chief Executive_ magazine recently graded it the third-worst state in the country for business.100 McQueary noted that higher taxes are not the answer: “Illinois is experiencing an alarming exodus of residents already . . . They don’t want to pay more of their money toward a lousy, debt-ridden state government.”101



Perhaps Rauner’s most important act as governor was to initiate the court challenge to labor union agency fees that led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision _Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees_ (AFSCME) in June 2018. The case regarded the ability of governments to charge agency fees to their workers who had not joined the workplace union.



Rauner filed a lawsuit challenging agency fee rules as unconstitutional violations of the First Amendment. A district court judge dismissed the suit, saying that the governor did not have standing to sue. However, a subsequent suit by Mark Janus and other plaintiffs wound its way to the Supreme Court, leading to the June decision, in which the court found that public employees cannot be forced to pay such fees as a condition of their employment.



The _Janus_ ruling will weaken unions in state and local governments, which in turn will provide policymakers with more flexibility to restrain government spending. As Rauner said, the ruling will allow for “much different compensation structure, much more flexibility, much more balance of power between the insiders and the outsiders.”102



Eric Holcomb, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2017



Eric Holcomb entered office in 2017 after a career in the U.S. Navy and numerous public service positions, including being an adviser to former governor Mitch Daniels.



Holcomb scored poorly on taxes in this report. In 2017, he signed a large transportation bill that increased the state’s gasoline tax from 18 cents to 28 cents per gallon and imposed new fees on vehicle owners. The fees included a new $15 vehicle registration fee, a $50 fee for hybrid car owners, and a $150 fee for electric car owners. The bill will raise about $700 million annually.



In 2018, Holcomb signed further tax measures into law. These included cutting sales taxes on software and increasing income taxes by conforming the state code to changes under the 2017 federal tax law.



Matt Bevin, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: December 2015



Before his election as governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin was an officer in the U.S. Army, worked in the financial industry, and owned several businesses. He and his wife have nine children.



Governor Bevin did not make major tax changes his first couple years in office, only approving some narrow breaks, such as a $3 million sales tax credit for aviation fuel. Then, in 2017, he called for larger reforms, including repealing the business inventory tax and the death tax. As he said, “Kentucky has a very complicated, convoluted, non-user-friendly tax code” that “should be simplified, so that it doesn’t penalize the very people we need for our future success.”103



In 2018, Kentucky passed its largest tax reform bill in decades and Bevin’s signature was not on it. The legislature passed the tax overhaul in April, Bevin vetoed it, and he was overridden.104 The bill raised revenues but reduced income tax rates.



The reform replaced multirate personal and corporate income taxes with flat-rate structures. Individual rates of 2 to 6 percent and corporate rates of 4 to 6 percent were replaced with a 5 percent flat rate for both individuals and businesses. The reform also simplified the corporate tax base, broadened the individual income tax base, broadened the sales tax base to include more services, and increased the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack.



In a letter explaining his veto, Bevin said that the bill fell “far short of comprehensive tax reform” and that he disagreed with the legislature’s revenue projections.105 Bevin seemed to approve of the general direction of tax reform, but he disapproved of the particular bill sent to him. Overall, the tax changes are expected to raise about $240 million a year, but the tax code will be simpler and more supportive of economic growth.



Kentucky’s growth has lagged that of its neighbor Tennessee for years. Kentucky has suffered net out-migration to other states, while Tennessee has enjoyed in-migration. This recent tax reform, along with a 2017 right-to-work law signed by Bevin, should help Kentucky start catching up with its more prosperous neighbor.



Kentucky’s general fund spending jumped 8.2 percent in 2017, but this increase slowed to 1.7 percent in 2018. Bevin proposed a range of spending cuts and a roughly flat budget for 2019, but the state legislature passed a spending increase over his veto. State government employment has been trimmed by 3 percent since Bevin entered office.106



Bevin’s 2018 state of the state address called for reforms to Kentucky’s public pensions, which have some of the lowest funding levels in the nation. The legislature passed, and he signed, some modest changes. Pension spending has risen from 5 percent of Kentucky’s general fund spending in 2008 to 15 percent today.107



John Bel Edwards, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2016



John Bel Edwards is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and he served eight years with the U.S. Army as an airborne ranger. Edwards went on to serve in the state legislature before being elected governor in 2015.



Edwards has spent much of his two and a half years in office pushing for higher taxes. Facing a budget shortfall in 2016, Edwards embraced a slew of tax increases. He signed into law higher taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, health care providers, vehicle rentals, business inventories, and other items, in addition to increasing corporate franchise taxes and broadening the sales tax base.108



The 2016 deal also included a “temporary” increase in the sales tax rate from 4 percent to 5 percent. However, when that hike was set to expire in 2018, Edwards and the legislature decided to retain about half of the increase for another seven years, so the state’s sales tax rate currently sits at 4.45 percent.109 Louisiana’s government will also receive a revenue infusion of more than $200 million a year because the state’s tax code automatically conformed to the 2017 federal law.110



In 2017, Edwards proposed a gross receipts tax which would have raised more than $400 million per year, but the state legislature quickly shot down the bill.111



Paul LePage, Republican Legislature: Divided



Grade: A Took office: January 2011



Governor Paul LePage is a staunch fiscal conservative. He has restrained spending and cut state employment by 7 percent since taking office.112 LePage has signed into law cost-cutting reforms to welfare and health programs, and he has decried the negative effects of big government: “Big, expensive welfare programs riddled with fraud and abuse threaten our future. Too many Mainers are dependent on government. Government dependency has not — and never will — create prosperity.”113



LePage has fought against Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, calling it a “boondoggle.” Maine voters approved a ballot measure in 2017 to adopt the expansion, but LePage continues to fight it with legal filings to the state’s Supreme Court. LePage said, “We don’t mind helping people get health care, but it should not be free. ‘Free’ is very expensive to somebody.”114 He has proposed conditions for implementing the expansion in a fiscally responsible way.



LePage has been a persistent tax cutter. In 2011, he approved large income tax cuts, which reduced the top individual rate, simplified tax brackets, and reduced taxes on low-income households. He also increased the estate tax exemption, cut business taxes, and halted automatic annual increases in the gas tax.



In 2013, LePage vetoed the legislature’s budget because it contained tax increases, including an increase in the sales tax rate from 5.0 percent to 5.5 percent. However, the legislature overrode his veto.



In 2015, LePage proposed a plan to reduce the top individual income tax rate from 7.95 percent to 5.75 percent, reduce the top corporate tax rate from 8.93 percent to 6.75 percent, eliminate narrow tax breaks, repeal the estate tax, and raise sales taxes.115 When the legislature rejected the plan, LePage said that he would veto any bills sponsored by Democrats. In the end, the legislature passed a budget that included substantial tax cuts over the veto of LePage, who wanted even larger cuts. The plan cut the top personal income tax rate from 7.95 to 7.15 percent, reduced taxes for low-income households, increased the estate tax exemption, and made the previous sales tax rate increase permanent.



In 2016, LePage pushed for more tax cuts. In his state of the state address, he proposed reducing the individual income tax rate to 4 percent over time and repealing the estate tax.



In November of that year, voters narrowly passed, by a 51–49 margin, an initiative (Question 2) to impose a 3 percentage point income tax surtax on households earning more than $200,000 a year to fund education. LePage opposed the hike.



LePage’s budget in January 2017 called for repeal of the surtax and a major overhaul of the state’s tax system.116 He proposed replacing the multirate individual income tax with a 5.75 percent flat tax, cutting the corporate tax rate, eliminating the estate tax, raising the exemption level on retirement income, and offsetting some of the revenue loss by broadening the sales tax base and raising lodging taxes. After a battle with the legislature and a government shutdown, a deal was struck to increase education spending but repeal the surtax on high earners imposed in 2016.117



In 2018, LePage proposed conforming to changes under the 2017 federal tax law. Simple conformity would raise taxes by about $300 million a year, so the governor proposed to offset the taxpayer cost with tax cuts for lower-income taxpayers, a corporate tax rate cut from 8.93 percent to 8.33 percent, and estate tax reductions.118 The legislature failed to pass the plan.



Maine’s tax battles never end. An initiative on the ballot this November (Question 1) would, if passed, impose a 3.8 percentage point surtax on payrolls and nonwage income of higher earners to fund a new universal home care program for seniors.



Larry Hogan, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: C Took office: January 2015



Larry Hogan won an upset victory in 2014 in Democratic-leaning Maryland. Hogan has enjoyed high favorability ratings in polls, and he has nudged Democrats in the legislature toward tax relief. In one early move, he used his executive authority to cut highway tolls and fees for state services.



In 2016, Hogan proposed a package of tax cuts for families and businesses. The plan would have reduced taxes on seniors and low-income families, reduced business fees, and cut taxes on businesses located in certain parts of the state. The legislature did not pass the plan.



In 2017, Hogan proposed a “More Jobs for Marylanders” plan, which involved tax credits for manufacturing businesses.119 The legislature passed the complex plan, which involves different levels of tax benefits by geographic area and the monitoring of recipient businesses, including the number of jobs they create and the training they provide. Hogan has also approved other narrow breaks that attempt to micromanage the economy through the tax code.120



In 2018, to offset automatic tax increases created by the new federal tax law, Hogan signed into law bills to increase the state’s standard deduction and earned income tax credit.



Hogan’s focus on narrow breaks for selected businesses is misguided. Instead, he should aim to cut taxes broadly by chopping Maryland’s 8.25 percent corporate income tax rate. Hogan has not made Maryland’s tax climate worse, but he should spearhead reforms to simplify and reduce taxes across the board.



Charlie Baker, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2015



After a career in the health care industry and state government, Charlie Baker was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2014. He has enjoyed high popularity among Republicans and Democrats.



In running for office, Baker said that he would not raise taxes, and he started out on the right foot. A 2014 ballot measure repealed automatic increases in the gas tax. In supporting that change, Baker said, “I’m not talking taxes, period. Not talking taxes, because as far as I’m concerned we have a long way to go here to demonstrate to the public, to each other and to everybody else that this is a grade-A super-functioning [highway department] machine that’s doing all the things it should be doing.”121



In 2016, Massachusetts voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, despite the opposition of Baker. In 2017, a marijuana legalization bill imposed a combined excise and sales tax on the product of up to 20 percent.122 The state will raise about $60 million from those taxes in the second half of 2018.



Also, in 2016, Baker approved a bill imposing a 20-cent-per-ride tax on ridesharing services such as Uber, with 5 cents of that tax going to the competitor taxi industry.123 In 2018, Baker proposed a tax on short-term rentals, such as Airbnb, and was still working on the details with the legislature as of August.124



Baker’s largest tax increase came in July 2018, when he approved a 0.63 percent payroll tax to finance a new paid family leave benefit.125 The new tax is expected to funnel an enormous $800 million a year into a new government bureaucracy, which will then hand out benefits to recipients.



The Massachusetts constitution requires that the state income tax be levied at a flat rate, which is currently 5.1 percent. In 2018, there was an effort to put on the November ballot a constitutional measure to impose a new “millionaires” tax on top of the current flat rate. Democrats had pushed the measure partly to encourage turnout at the polls. Fortunately, the state Supreme Court struck down the effort in June. Baker stayed quiet about the proposal.126 Residents of Massachusetts have voted against imposing a progressive income tax five times since 1960.127



Rick Snyder, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



After a successful business career, Rick Snyder came into office eager to solve Michigan’s economic problems. The governor has pursued important reforms, such as restructuring Detroit’s finances and signing into law right-to-work legislation.



Snyder has made important tax reforms. He repealed the damaging Michigan Business Tax and replaced it with a less harmful corporate income tax. In 2014, he helped push through a large reduction in property taxes on business equipment to spur capital investment.



In 2015, he signed into law a mechanism that will automatically decrease state income taxes whenever general fund revenue growth exceeds inflation by a certain percentage. The mechanism will go into effect in 2023.



However, Snyder has also increased taxes. In 2015, he increased gasoline taxes and vehicle fees to raise more than $500 million a year. Snyder and the legislature pushed through this tax package despite Michigan voters having rejected by an 80–20 margin a sales and gas tax increase for transportation on a May 2015 referendum (Proposal 1). That rejection was “the most one-sided loss ever for a proposed amendment to the state constitution of 1963.”128 Yet later that year, Snyder and the legislature hiked taxes for transportation anyway.



In 2017, Michigan enacted pension reforms for public school employees, enrolling new hires in a defined contribution plan with the option of a hybrid plan. This reform, championed by Snyder, will substantially reduce the system’s future costs. The American Legislative Exchange Council called it “one of the biggest success stories across the states in 2017” in terms of fiscal reforms.129 That same year, Snyder also approved a bill banning local governments from imposing taxes on food and soda.



In 2018, Snyder signed legislation to offset the expected tax increase caused by the 2017 federal tax law. The legislation increases the state’s personal exemption and reduces state revenues by about $180 million a year.130



In November 2018, Michigan voters will consider an initiative to legalize and tax recreational marijuana. Under the initiative, both a 10 percent excise tax and the state’s 6 percent sales tax would be imposed on the product.131



Mark Dayton, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Mark Dayton scored poorly on previous Cato report cards, and he does so again on this one. His poor grades have stemmed from his large spending increases and tax hikes. Under Dayton, Minnesota’s general fund spending has increased by 49 percent in 7 years (2011–2018); it rose 4.7 percent in 2017 and 8.0 percent in 2018.



In 2013, Dayton approved a package that raised annual revenues by $1 billion, which was almost 5 percent of total state tax revenues. The package increased the top individual income tax rate from 7.85 percent to 9.85 percent and hiked the cigarette tax by $1.60 per pack.



In 2014, Dayton reversed course and approved tax cuts of about $500 million a year, including reductions to income taxes, estate taxes, and sales taxes on business purchases. But Dayton reversed again, and in 2015 and 2016 he proposed raising taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars a year, although those proposals did not pass the legislature.



With a budget surplus in 2016, Republicans in the legislature proposed major tax cuts, including reductions in property taxes on business equipment. It seemed as if Dayton might reach a compromise on these cuts, but the bill that passed the legislature included a drafting error, and Dayton refused to sign it.132 That same year, Dayton proposed raising gas taxes and vehicle fees by $400 million a year.133



In 2017, Dayton and the legislature feuded again over a budget surplus. Dayton’s budget called for $300 million in tax cuts, but the legislature wanted to cut $1.15 billion. They reached a compromise on a grab bag of cuts, many of which will do little to spur economic growth, such as expansions in tax credits.



The bad blood between Dayton and the legislature continued in 2018. Minnesota enjoyed further surpluses and is expected to receive a revenue windfall of about $400 million a year if it conforms to the 2017 federal tax law. Dayton wants to increase education spending, expand low-income tax credits, and reverse some of the previous year’s tax cuts that he did not agree with.134



The legislature sent Dayton a bill to increase education spending and modestly cut individual and corporate tax rates. However, Dayton vetoed it because he did not want to cut corporate taxes and because the plan did not include low-income tax credits.135 Without a compromise on federal tax conformity, Minnesota residents will be left with a higher tax burden and a more complicated tax code.



Phil Bryant, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2012



Phil Bryant was a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, state auditor, and lieutenant governor before being elected governor in 2011.



Bryant signed into law major tax cuts for businesses and individuals in 2016. His most important reform was phasing out, over 10 years, the corporate franchise tax, which is imposed on businesses in addition to the state’s corporate income tax.136 The tax currently raises about $260 million a year. Bryant gets credit for approving the measure, but business tax reform was mainly driven by the legislature.



The 2016 tax package included other reductions. It cut taxes for self-employed individuals and cut the bottom individual and corporate income tax rates, from 3 percent to zero.137



Bryant also scores highly on spending in this report. Although Mississippi’s general fund budget jumped during his first few years in office, it has been flat since 2016. Also, state government employment has been trimmed by a few percentage points in recent years.



Steve Bullock, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: January 2013



Governor Steve Bullock scored very well on spending in this report. Slower-growing state revenues in recent years have prompted restraint on the spending side of the budget.



However, Bullock’s grade on this report card was pulled down by his proposed and enacted tax increases and his vetoes of tax cuts passed by the legislature. One plan he vetoed in 2015 would have trimmed the corporate tax rate, reduced the number of individual income tax brackets, and simplified the income tax base.



In 2016, Bullock proposed raising the individual income tax rate on top earners from 6.9 percent to 7.9 percent. He has also proposed raising taxes on beer, wine, and spirits, and he proposed a $30 million tax on investments in a workers’ compensation fund.138 These proposals were rejected by the legislature.



Bullock succeeded in getting transportation-related tax increases passed. In 2017, he signed into law an increase to the gas tax of 6 cents per gallon and higher charges on vehicles.139



In November, Montana voters will decide on the ballot (Initiative 185) whether to increase cigarette taxes by $2 per pack to fund an extension of the state’s Medicaid program. Bullock is a strong supporter of the plan.140



Pete Ricketts, Republican Legislature: Nonpartisan



Grade: B Took office: January 2015



Pete Ricketts is an entrepreneur and a former executive with TD Ameritrade. He is a conservative who favors tax reductions and spending restraint.



In 2015, Governor Ricketts vetoed a gas tax increase, arguing that Nebraska should solve its infrastructure challenges without tax hikes. The legislature overrode him to enact the increase.



While running for governor, Ricketts campaigned on property tax reduction, and he signed into law relief for homeowners, businesses, and farmers in 2015. Since then, he has supported further property tax relief. After the 2018 Supreme Court decision regarding online sales taxes, Ricketts said, “Any increased revenue attributable to total enforcement of our sales tax laws must be steered towards property tax relief.”141



In 2017, Ricketts supported a major tax overhaul that would have cut the top individual income tax rate from 6.84 percent to 5.99 percent and the corporate tax rate from 7.81 percent to 5.99 percent.142 The cuts would have been phased in over time and contingent on state revenue growth. In his state of the state speech, the governor said, “If we want to outpace other Midwestern states, we have to be competitive on taxes.”143 Unfortunately, the legislature did not pass the plan.



In 2018, Ricketts supported a plan to cut property taxes and corporate taxes. The property tax cuts would take the form of income tax credits for local property taxes paid, and the top corporate tax rate would be cut from 7.81 percent to 6.84 percent.144 Again, the plan did not pass the legislature.



However, Ricketts did sign into law a bill that adjusts the state tax code to offset the tax-raising effects of the 2017 federal tax law.145 The bill changed the Nebraska tax base rather than cutting tax rates, but it will provide relief of about $300 million annually.



Brian Sandoval, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Brian Sandoval came into office promising no tax increases, but in 2015, he made a giant U-turn and signed into law the largest tax increase in Nevada’s history, at more than $600 million per year. The package included a $1 per pack cigarette tax increase, an extension of a previous sales tax hike, an increase in business license fees, a new excise tax on transportation companies, and an increase in the Modified Business Tax.



However, the worst part of the package was the imposition of a whole new business tax, the Commerce Tax.146 This tax is imposed on the gross receipts of all Nevada businesses above a threshold size. The tax has 26 different rates based on the industry. It is a complex and distortionary tax.



The Commerce Tax was imposed to increase education funding, even though Sandoval and the legislature had been directly rebuked by the public in 2014 for their effort to impose a new tax for education. In a November 2014 ballot, Nevada voters had overwhelmingly rejected, by a 79–21 margin, the adoption of a new franchise tax to fund education. In recent years, there have been numerous efforts to repeal the Commerce Tax.



Meanwhile, Sandoval and the legislature have been handing out narrow tax breaks to electric car companies, data centers, and other favored businesses. In 2014, Sandoval approved a deal to provide $1.25 billion in special tax breaks and subsidies over 20 years to Tesla. In 2016, Sandoval supported legislation to raise hotel taxes and provide a $750 million subsidy to relocate the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas.147 Under Sandoval, Nevada’s tax policy entails large tax increases for businesses in general but narrow breaks for the lucky few.



In 2016, Nevada voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, and the state imposed the general sales tax and a 15 percent wholesale tax on the product. In 2017, Sandoval signed a bill imposing an additional 10 percent retail sales tax on recreational marijuana.148



Sandoval scores poorly on spending in this report. State government employment is up 17 percent since he entered office.149



Chris Sununu, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2017



Chris Sununu is a former business owner and executive, as well as a former member of the New Hampshire Executive Council.



New Hampshire is a low-tax state with no personal income tax, but it does impose two major taxes on businesses, the Business Profits Tax and the Business Enterprise Tax. Under the previous governor, in 2015, the state passed reforms to trim the rates of both taxes. In 2017, Governor Sununu signed legislation to further reduce the rates of both taxes.150 The Business Profits Tax will fall from 7.9 percent to 7.5 percent in coming years, and the Business Enterprise Tax will fall from 0.675 percent to 0.5 percent.151 Sununu also signed legislation to increase the dollar limit on capital expensing for small businesses.



Susana Martinez, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: A Took office: January 2011



Susana Martinez was a prosecutor for 25 years and is now in her eighth year as governor of New Mexico. Martinez did well on previous Cato reports, and she receives the top score on this edition because of her spending restraint, tax cuts, and opposition to tax increases. New Mexico’s general fund budget has been roughly flat in recent years, and she has built a reputation for vetoing wasteful spending. State government employment is down about 4 percent over the past three years.152



On taxes, Martinez has pursued reforms to make New Mexico more competitive. In 2012, she signed a bill reducing gross receipts taxes on inputs to construction and manufacturing. In 2013, she pushed through a cut to the corporate income tax rate, from 7.6 to 5.9 percent, phased in over five years.



With revenues from energy production stagnant in recent years, balancing New Mexico’s budget has been a challenge. But Martinez has held firm against tax increases proposed by the legislature. In 2017, she vetoed bills that would have increased taxes by $350 million a year, including increases to gas taxes, vehicle fees, freight truck charges, gross receipts taxes, and hospital taxes.153



Her veto message said, “From the beginning, I have said that I will not raise taxes, yet the legislature continues to try to force tax increases on New Mexican families and small businesses.”154 The public is resistant to tax increases as well. On a 2017 ballot in Santa Fe, people voted down, by a 58–42 margin, a new excise tax on sweetened drinks that would have funded education.155



In 2018, Martinez told the legislature that any budget bills that included tax increases were dead on arrival.156 The good news is that “a revenue uptick driven by an oil drilling boom in southeastern New Mexico” has made budgeting a little easier this year.157



Martinez has continued to use her veto pen on tax-hike bills. As one recent news report said, “Gov. Susana Martinez, who has been resolute in opposing all tax increases throughout her two terms in office, has vetoed legislation that would have imposed a $100 fee on pet foods.”158



Andrew Cuomo, Democrat Legislature: Divided



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Andrew Cuomo was originally seen as a centrist Democrat who reduced taxes and reformed public pensions. But in recent years, he has moved to the left on economic policies, and his grade is lower on this report than on past ones.



In 2014, Cuomo signed into law a package of business tax reforms. The package cut the corporate income tax rate from 7.1 percent to 6.5 percent, reduced the corporate tax rate on qualified manufacturers from 5.9 percent to zero, ended a separate bank tax system, ended a surcharge on utility customers, and reduced the property tax burden on manufacturers.159



In 2016, Cuomo approved individual income tax cuts in a compromise with Republicans in the legislature. The cuts are being phased in over time and will reduce tax rates on middle-income taxpayers.160



In 2017, Cuomo reversed course and extended tax hikes on high earners to raise about $4 billion a year. The top state income tax rate in New York is 8.82 percent, atop which New York City adds a 3.876 percentage point tax. Those rates encourage taxpayers with high incomes to leave the state, which undermines the economy and the state budget. Because the top 1 percent of earners in New York pays 41 percent of the state’s income taxes, even a small out-migration of those taxpayers has a substantial impact on the budget.161



In 2018, Cuomo approved a new “congestion charge” in Manhattan on taxis and ride-hailing services, such as Uber, that will raise more than $400 million a year.162 He also proposed other tax increases in his most recent budget.



Cuomo’s tax increases on high earners are particularly shortsighted, given the capping of deductions for state and local taxes under the 2017 federal tax law. New York already has the lowest ratio of domestic in-migration to out-migration of any state, at 0.65.163 For every 100 households moving out of New York, just 65 are moving in.



In his 2018 state of the state address, Cuomo patted himself on the back for making the state tax code “more progressive.”164 But in the address, he also criticized the new federal deduction cap for state and local taxes, even though that reform makes the federal tax code “more progressive.”



In an effort to shield New York from increased tax competition, in 2018 Cuomo signed into law mechanisms to convert part of now-nondeductible taxes into deductible employer payroll taxes and charitable contributions. The schemes may not be effective or pass muster under federal tax law, but more important, they attempt to evade the reality that New York desperately needs a leaner government with lower taxes.165



Roy Cooper, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2017



Governor Roy Cooper entered office in 2017 after serving as North Carolina’s attorney general for 16 years. Cooper scored poorly on both spending and taxes in this report. The state’s general fund budget rose 4.3 percent in 2018, and Cooper proposed a 6.5 percent budget increase for 2019. The legislature enacted a lower spending increase for 2019 over Cooper’s veto. Last year’s budget bill was also passed over his veto.



On taxes, Cooper has tried to block efforts by the legislature to make pro-growth reforms. The governor vetoed tax legislation in 2017 but was overridden by the legislature. That law cut the flat individual income rate from 5.499 percent to 5.25 percent and the corporate tax rate from 3.0 percent to 2.5 percent. The bill also changed the individual income tax base, the franchise tax, and sales taxes on business inputs. Altogether, the law will cut taxes by more than $900 million annually.



A similar scenario played out in 2018. Governor Cooper’s budget proposed freezing the phase-in of corporate income tax reductions and some of the personal income tax reductions. He wanted higher revenues to fund a spending increase. The legislature rejected the proposals and passed the budget over Cooper’s veto.166 The adopted budget includes a smaller spending increase, retains the 2017 tax cuts, and conforms the state’s tax code to recent federal changes. As of June 2018, Cooper had vetoed 14 bills during his year and a half in office, and the legislature had overridden 11 of those vetoes.167



Doug Burgum, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: A Took office: December 2016



Doug Burgum is a former entrepreneur and software company executive who is in his first term as governor. He promised that he will restrain spending, run an efficient government, and not raise taxes.168 So far, he has honored those promises. He has also fulfilled a campaign promise to take an annual salary of just $1.



North Dakota’s boom from energy production turned into a bust after 2014 as the price of oil plunged. The strong economy had created a gusher of government revenue fueled by rising severance taxes on oil production. State policymakers had expanded the budget rapidly during the boom, so when the bust in revenues came, budget cuts were needed.



Since Burgum entered office in December 2016, his focus has been on fiscal restraint. State government spending was cut by 5 percent between the 2015–2017 biennium and the 2017–2019 biennium.169 Earlier this year, the governor called for further reductions. He issued a directive that “agencies slash budgets 5 percent or 10 percent, with the larger ones responsible for the bigger cuts. He also called for agencies to identify an additional 3 percent reduction as a cushion against commodity price swings. Additionally, Burgum called for a 5 percent reduction in agency staffing when they begin preparing their plans for the next two-year budget.”170 State government employment is down 4 percent since Burgum entered office.171



This year, there is hope that energy tax revenues are on the rise again, but Burgum’s budgeting is still cautious. He vows to keep a tight grip on spending: “The culture has been, a bigger budget you’re a winner and the smaller budget you’re a loser . . . We need to change the culture.”172 He is promising not to over-expand the budget this time around: “We have to rebuild our savings and not spend every single dime we bring in.”173



John Kasich, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



John Kasich has a generally fiscally conservative record as governor of Ohio. He has approved numerous tax reductions. In 2013, he signed a law cutting individual income tax rates by 10 percent, with the top rate falling from 5.93 to 5.33 percent. The plan also exempted a portion of small business income from taxation. To partly offset the revenue loss, the plan broadened the base of the state sales tax and raised the sales tax rate. In 2014, the income tax rate reductions were accelerated and personal exemptions were increased.



In 2015, Kasich approved further income tax rate cuts. Individual rates were slashed across the board, and the top rate dropped to 5.0 percent. The 2015 legislation also allowed taxpayers to exempt the first $250,000 of business income, with just a 3 percent tax rate above that threshold. The revenue losses from the 2015 tax cuts were partly offset by a cigarette tax increase from $1.25 to $1.60 per pack.



In 2017, Kasich proposed reducing the number of individual income tax brackets from nine to five and cutting the top tax rate to 4.3 percent. The revenue loss would be partly offset by raising sales taxes and cigarette taxes.174 The legislature approved only small individual and business tax cuts and reduced the number of individual income tax brackets from nine to seven.



General fund spending rose briskly in Kasich’s earlier years in office, but spending has been roughly flat in recent years, and he scored well on spending in this report.



Mary Fallin, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Mary Fallin scored well on previous Cato report cards, but in recent years she has supported a series of large tax increases.



In 2016, she approved tax increases on oil and gas leases as well as base-broadening measures for the income tax. The same year, Oklahoma voters soundly defeated, by a 59–41 margin, a major tax hike (Question 779) at the ballot box. The initiative, opposed by Fallin, would have increased the state sales tax rate by one percentage point.



Despite the strong anti-tax message delivered by voters in 2016, Fallin supported large tax increases in 2017. She signed into law tax increases on motor vehicle purchases, the energy industry, sporting event tickets, and other items. She also approved a tobacco “fee” of $1.50 per cigarette pack that had passed the legislature with a majority vote, but the state Supreme Court struck it down as a tax increase, which, according to the state constitution, must pass with a supermajority vote.



The tax increases continued in 2018. Fallin and state legislators caved to pressure from the state teachers’ lobby and enacted a bill to raise more than $450 million a year to fund higher teacher pay.175 The package included a dollar-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes and higher taxes on gas and energy production.



Kate Brown, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F Took office: February 2015



Kate Brown, an attorney and former legislator, became governor of Oregon in 2015 after Governor John Kitzhaber resigned during a corruption scandal. Oregon has enjoyed a strong economy in recent years, which has raised state revenues and encouraged government expansion. General fund spending rose 13.9 percent in the 2015–2017 biennium and is expected to rise 10.3 percent in the current 2017–2019 biennium.176



Even with the state’s coffers filling up, Governor Brown has sought numerous tax increases. In 2016, she pushed for a large package of tax and fee hikes, including higher cigarette and business taxes. She also signed into law increases in the state’s lodging tax.



Brown supported Measure 97 on the November 2016 ballot, which would have imposed a new gross receipts tax on businesses to raise $3 billion a year.177 However, Oregon voters soundly defeated the measure by a margin of 59–41.



Brown did not accept the anti-tax message delivered by voters in 2016, and she kept pushing for tax hikes in 2017. She signed into law a transportation package that increased taxes by more than $500 million per year. This package included a gas tax increase, higher vehicle fees, a new statewide payroll tax to fund transit, and even a new bicycle excise tax at $15 per bicycle. She also approved tax increases on health insurance and hospitals.178



In 2018, the governor signed legislation decoupling the state tax base from the tax reductions for pass-through businesses under the 2017 federal tax reform.



Tom Wolf, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2015



Tom Wolf was elected governor in 2014 after a career running a family business. However, his fiscal policy actions have undermined the environment for business growth in Pennsylvania.



In 2015, Wolf and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature battled over how to close a budget gap, with Wolf pushing for large tax increases and Republicans opposing. One area of possible agreement was swapping a sales tax increase for a property tax cut. In the end, the budget passed with no major tax changes.



In 2016, Wolf’s budget proposed more than $2 billion in annual tax increases, including a higher individual income tax rate, severance taxes on natural gas production, increases in sales taxes, and higher tobacco taxes. In the end, the legislature agreed to $675 million per year in tax increases, including a $1 per pack increase in cigarette taxes.



In 2017, Wolf pushed another package of tax hikes totaling $1 billion a year, including higher severance taxes, a broadening of the sales and corporate tax bases, and insurance premium taxes. He ultimately signed into law a smaller package of almost $200 million a year, which included online sales taxes, internet gaming taxes, and other charges. In 2018, Wolf continued to push for higher severance taxes that would raise about $250 million annually.



All of these tax increases have not stabilized Pennsylvania’s finances. On a per capita basis, the state is among the 10 worst for debt and unfunded pension liabilities, and it has one of the lowest credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s.179



Gina Raimondo, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2015



Gina Raimondo has a background in economics, law, and the venture capital industry. As Rhode Island’s treasurer in 2011, she made the news for successfully pushing through major reforms of the state’s pension system, including benefit reductions.



As governor since 2015, Raimondo has a fiscally moderate record, and she was the highest-scoring Democrat on Cato’s 2016 report card. Her score was pulled down this time by above-average spending increases and cigarette tax increases. But, to her credit, she is calling for a law change to give her a line-item veto to reduce wasteful spending.



Raimondo has signed into law several modest tax cuts, including reductions in taxes on pension income, sales, alcohol, and cuts to the corporate minimum tax. She also called for, and the legislature passed, a reduction in unemployment insurance taxes on employers.



However, Raimondo approved cigarette tax increases in 2015 and 2017, and she has called for further cigarette tax increases in 2018 even though the state’s tax rate is already $4.25 per pack. Raimondo has also proposed broadening the sales tax base and raising various business fees.



Henry McMaster, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: A Took office: January 2017



Before entering the governor’s office in 2017, Henry McMaster served two years as lieutenant governor, eight years as attorney general, and four years as U.S. attorney for South Carolina. McMaster is off to a fiscally conservative start as governor by offering a restrained budget this year, supporting pension reforms, vetoing tax increases, and proposing income tax reforms.



In 2017, McMaster vetoed a transportation bill that raised gas taxes by 12 cents per gallon and jacked up vehicle fees. He pointed out that one-quarter of current gas taxes are siphoned off for nonroad activities.180 Unfortunately, the legislature overrode his veto, and when phased in, the new law will increase taxes and fees by about $600 million annually.181



In 2018, McMaster proposed cutting each individual income tax rate in the state’s multirate system by 1 percentage point, with the cuts phased in over five years. The bill would have provided $2.2 billion in tax relief over those first five years.182 In his state of the state speech, the governor said, “Taxes of all kinds at all levels add up — little by little — to smother growth. . . . We must respect the right of the people to their own money, for their own purposes, according to their own priorities.”183



The governor supports measures to conform South Carolina’s tax code to the changes made by the 2017 federal tax law. Simply conforming to the federal tax code would result in a substantial state tax increase, so McMaster wants to offset that increase with tax cuts. However, he and the state legislature have not yet agreed on a plan to do so.184



Like many states, South Carolina faces a large funding gap in the public employee pension system. McMaster is calling for a major overhaul.185 He proposes closing the state’s defined-benefit plan to new entrants and moving to a defined contribution plan. For the legacy pension system, he proposes raising the age of retirement and reducing cost-of-living adjustments.



Dennis Daugaard, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2011



Governor Dennis Daugaard earned a poor grade on this fiscal report card because of his support of large tax and spending increases.



Daugaard began his tenure opposed to tax increases and a defender of South Dakota’s low-tax environment. In 2012, for example, he came out on the side of voters who defeated a ballot measure to raise the state’s sales tax from 4 percent to 5 percent.



But over time, Daugaard reversed course. In 2015, he signed into law substantial increases in gas taxes, excise taxes on vehicles, and vehicle fees. In 2016, he signed into law an increase in the sales tax from 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent. That tax hike generated a large increase in overall state revenues because sales taxes are the dominant source of revenue for South Dakota.



Daugaard has been a vocal proponent of expanding the ability of states to tax interstate commerce. In 2016, the governor “signed S.B. 106, which requires some remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax to the state even if they have no physical presence. Acknowledging that S.B. 106 was essentially written as a legal brief, the state quickly began moving the law through the courts by suing Wayfair and two other large online retailers.”186



In _South Dakota v. Wayfair_ , the state argued that the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn its 1992 decision, _Quill v. North Dakota_ , which held that states may only tax out-of-state sellers if those sellers maintain a physical presence in the state. The Court ruled in favor of South Dakota in June 2018, opening the door for every state to be more aggressive in collecting online sales taxes.



South Dakota policymakers had promised that they would reduce the sales tax increase they had passed in 2016 to the extent that they were able to raise online sales tax revenue.187 Time will tell whether they follow through on that promise.



South Dakota voters will have a chance to weigh in on taxes this November. Advocates have placed a $1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax on the ballot (Measure 25). Voters in neighboring North Dakota soundly defeated such a cigarette tax increase on the ballot in 2016 (Measure 4) by a 62–38 margin.



Bill Haslam, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Bill Haslam received a B on the 2016 Cato report. But his grade on this report is weighed down by substantial spending increases in recent years. The state general fund budget rose 4.7 percent in 2017 and 9.8 percent in 2018. State government employment has been trending upwards since 2013.



Haslam scores much better on taxes. In 2016, his big reform was repealing the “Hall tax,” which was a 6 percent tax on dividends and interest. Tennessee has no broad-based income tax, but it had this anti-savings levy. The reform reduces the tax by one percentage point a year until it is gone.



In 2017, Haslam signed a transportation bill that increased the gas tax by 6 cents per gallon, increased the diesel tax by 10 cents per gallon, and increased vehicle fees. But Haslam also approved cuts to the franchise and excise tax on manufacturers, the sales tax on food (from 5 percent to 4 percent), and taxes on aviation fuel.



In 2018, Haslam signed a bill decoupling the state tax code from certain changes under the federal tax law that would have increased taxes for some businesses. The decoupling will reduce state taxes by more than $100 million when phased in.188



The economy of Tennessee has boomed in recent years. The state’s low taxes are a magnet for people and jobs, and it has one of the highest rates of net domestic in-migration in the nation.189 As the _Wall Street Journal_ recently reported, “AllianceBernstein Holding LP plans to relocate its headquarters, chief executive and most of its New York staff to Nashville, Tenn., in an attempt to cut costs. . . . In a memo to employees, AllianceBernstein cited lower state, city and property taxes compared with the New York metropolitan area among the reasons for the relocation. Nashville’s affordable cost of living, shorter commutes and ability to draw talent were other factors.”190 A recent change by Haslam to the business tax helped entice the firm to relocate to Tennessee.191



Greg Abbott, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: A Took office: January 2015



Greg Abbott was the attorney general of Texas under Governor Rick Perry, who served 14 years in office. Abbott assumed the governorship in January 2015 with a reputation as a fiscal conservative. Abbott scores highly on spending in this report because the Texas general fund budget has been flat in recent years. 



Abbott’s conservative reputation has also been affirmed on tax policy. He has taken aim at the state’s damaging franchise tax, the Margin Tax. In 2015, he signed into law a 25 percent cut to this tax, which saved Texas businesses $1.3 billion annually. He also approved legislation to scrap needless annual licensing fees on doctors and other professionals, saving them $125 million a year.



In his 2017 state of the state address, Abbott again attacked the franchise tax, stating, “As far as I’m concerned, the only good tax is a dead tax. We must continue to cut the business franchise tax until it fits in a coffin.”192 In his proposed budget he said, “The legislature must prioritize the phase-out of the rightfully ridiculed business franchise tax.”193



Abbott’s budget recommended cutting the franchise tax rate to save businesses an additional $250 million per year. Both the Texas House and Senate passed bills to cut the franchise tax in 2017, but they did not agree on a compromise.194



Gary Herbert, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: August 2009



Gary Herbert is in his third term as governor of Utah. His grades on past Cato report cards were rather poor. General fund spending has soared under his tenure, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4 percent since 2010. Spending slowed to 1.6 percent in 2017 and rose 5.2 percent in 2018. However, Utah’s population has grown quickly, so spending growth is less excessive on a per capita basis.



In 2015, Herbert approved substantial tax increases. He raised gasoline taxes and approved a statewide property tax hike. He also signed legislation in both 2015 and 2018 to make it easier for local governments to raise their sales taxes.195



There were few changes to Utah’s taxes in 2016 and 2017. But in 2018, the governor and legislature agreed to modest tax cuts to offset state tax increases created by federal tax reform. These cuts reduced the personal and corporate income tax rates from 5.0 percent to 4.95 percent.



Alas, Herbert reversed course again and is supporting a tax increase on the November 2018 ballot (Question 1). Utah voters will decide whether to hike gasoline taxes by 10 cents per gallon to raise about $180 million a year.196 Most of the new revenues will go to education spending, not transportation, because of pressure on legislators from school lobby groups.



Phil Scott, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B Took office: January 2017



Phil Scott came to the governor’s office after 8 years as Vermont’s lieutenant governor and 10 years in its Senate. He is also a former small-business owner.



Scott has battled with the Vermont legislature over the state’s budget, and he has issued numerous vetoes. In 2017, Scott vetoed the first budget bill sent to his desk because it omitted his reforms to cut costs on teachers’ health care.197



In 2018, the governor battled with the legislature over property taxes to fund schools. He vetoed two budget bills that contained property tax increases before letting a third pass without his signature.198 Instead of tax increases to fund schools, he proposed to save money by reducing the number of support staff in schools.



Also, in 2018, Scott vetoed a paid family leave bill that would have funded subsidies through a new payroll tax of more than $16 million a year. In his veto message, he said, “I cannot support legislation which adds or increases taxes on Vermonters. . . . After years of constantly increasing taxes and fees, Vermonters need a break. They need the opportunity to keep more of what they earn. At the same time, our businesses need a stable and predictable environment in which they can invest, grow and create more good jobs.”199 He also noted that the costs of such a program would invariably be greater than the $16 million initially raised by this tax.



Vermont is a high-tax state adjacent to New Hampshire, which is a low-tax state that does not have an individual income tax. For years, Vermont has suffered from net out-migration to other states, while New Hampshire has gained from in-migration. The 2017 federal tax law will make Vermont’s high taxes even more painful for the state’s residents and will likely exacerbate out-migration. Scott has noted this problem, and he has promised to weed out inefficiencies in Vermont’s government.



In 2018, Scott approved a bill passed by the legislature to legalize marijuana. Vermont is the first state to legalize recreational marijuana through legislation rather than through a popular initiative.200 The state is currently studying how best to set up a marketplace for the product.



Jay Inslee, Democrat Legislature: Democrat



Grade: F Took office: January 2013



Governor Jay Inslee is the worst-scoring governor on this report card. His appetite for tax and spending increases has been insatiable.



Inslee has pushed relentlessly for tax increases. He originally campaigned on a promise not to raise taxes, but he proposed more than $1 billion in higher taxes in his first budget in 2013.201 In 2014, he proposed a new tax on capital gains and increases in cigarette taxes and other taxes. In 2015, he approved a gas tax increase as well as higher taxes on businesses. In 2016, he proposed broadening the bases of various taxes to raise funding for education.



In his budget for the 2017–2019 biennium, Inslee proposed increasing the state’s business and occupation tax rate to raise more than $1.1 billion a year, creating a new capital gains tax of 7.9 percent to raise more than $800 million a year, and creating a carbon tax to raise more than $900 million a year.202 Most of his proposed tax hikes did not make it through the legislature, but Inslee did sign into law an increase in the state property tax and online sales tax to raise $1.5 billion annually.203 He also vetoed legislation to reduce the business and occupation tax rate.



Inslee has continued to advocate for a carbon tax even though the idea has been rejected by both the state legislature and Washington’s voters. In November 2016, voters rejected a carbon tax (Initiative 732) by a solid 59–41 margin. But in the wake of that defeat, Inslee has continued to push for such a tax; his latest plan is designed to raise at least $750 million in its first year and growing amounts after that.204 So far, the plan has failed to pass the legislature.



Carbon-tax supporters keep trying, and they have put another scheme on the ballot for November 2018. Voters will decide on Initiative 1631 whether to impose a new tax on carbon emissions to raise about $800 million a year by 2027.205 The tax would be collected from various industries, although the plan exempts certain politically favored industries.



Inslee scores poorly on spending in this report. The current biennial general fund budget is up 17 percent over the prior budget.206 State government employment has risen more than 7 percent since Inslee took office.207



Jim Justice, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2017



Jim Justice has one of the more interesting backgrounds among the governors. He built a major farm business that was the largest grain producer on the East Coast, and he also owns a major coal company and numerous other businesses. With a net worth of about $1.6 billion, he is West Virginia’s richest person.



Justice was elected as a Democrat in November 2016. But in August 2017, he announced at a rally with President Trump that he was switching to the Republican Party. 



On the campaign trail, Justice implied that he would not raise taxes, but in his first budget he proposed tax hikes of $400 million annually.208 He proposed to increase the state’s sales tax rate from 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent and to create a new “commercial activities tax” on business gross receipts.209



Those tax changes did not pass, but Justice did sign into law a package of transportation-related taxes and fees, including increased taxes and fees on gasoline, vehicle registration, vehicle sales, and drivers’ licenses. Those increases will raise about $140 million annually.



In 2018, schoolteachers in the state went on strike to demand higher pay. This high-profile action led the governor and legislature to agree to pay raises for teachers and other state workers.



Justice has taken one very positive fiscal step. He proposed cuts to the state’s high property taxes on machinery, equipment, and inventory.210 Those taxes raise the cost of investment and are a substantial barrier to growth in manufacturing. The governor has proposed phasing in reductions to the taxes over seven years.



Scott Walker, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Scott Walker has reformed Wisconsin’s retirement plans and labor union rules for government workers. He has also signed into law numerous tax cuts. However, on this and previous Cato report cards, his grade is pulled down by his above-average spending increases.



Walker approved individual income tax cuts in 2013 and followed up with further cuts for low- and middle-income taxpayers in 2014. Wisconsin’s five income tax brackets were reduced to four brackets with lower rates. The state’s standard deduction was increased, and various modest tax breaks for businesses were passed. Walker also approved substantial property tax relief.



In 2016, Walker battled against the legislature regarding raising taxes to fund transportation. As Walker said, “Raising taxes and fees is not the answer. . . . I am confident we can do better than placing new taxes on Wisconsin citizens.”211



However, Walker could have done more to reduce the anti-growth parts of Wisconsin’s tax code, particularly its high 7.9 percent corporate tax rate. Wisconsin ranks poorly on the Tax Foundation’s state business tax climate index.212



Instead, Walker has focused on giving individual companies special breaks. He spearheaded the huge “incentives” package Wisconsin is giving the Taiwanese firm Foxconn to build a manufacturing plant in the state. The package is worth more than $3 billion in spending subsidies and tax breaks.213 In 2018, Walker supported a $100 million package of special tax breaks for paper company Kimberly-Clark.214 It would make more sense for Walker to cut the corporate tax rate for all businesses rather than playing winners and losers with the tax code.



In 2017, Walker proposed a cut to the bottom two individual income tax rates to save taxpayers about $100 million a year. The legislature nixed that plan. Walker ended up signing into law a repeal of the state’s alternative minimum tax, reduced property taxes on machinery, and a few small corporate tax changes.



In 2018, Walker championed and signed into law rather silly rebate checks of $100 per child to families. He also proposed that the new revenues expected from online sales taxes be offset by other tax reductions.



Matt Mead, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



The Tax Foundation reports that Wyoming has the best tax climate for businesses in the nation.215 Wyoming has neither a corporate nor an individual income tax. Governor Matt Mead has not tampered with that efficient tax structure. However, he has raised other taxes, including gas taxes in 2013 and vehicle and driver fees in 2017. He also signed a 2017 law to impose sales taxes on remote sellers.



Mead scores very well on spending. With coal production down in recent years, Wyoming has faced economic adjustments and stagnant state revenues. Mead and the legislature have focused on closing budget gaps with spending restraint. In 2016, Mead signed into law a package of spending reductions that combined specific program cuts with across-the-board reductions. Later, Mead and the legislature cut Wyoming’s 2019–2020 biennium budget 5 percent from the previous biennium’s budget. State government employment has also been trending downward since 2015.216

47 The National Association of State Budget Officers compiles tax changes proposed by governors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures compiles enacted tax changes. However, these data sources have substantial shortcomings, so I examined hundreds of news articles and state budget documents to assess the major tax changes during each governor’s tenure. Tax changes seriously proposed by governors, tax changes vetoed by them, and tax changes signed into law were all taken into account. It is, however, difficult to measure this variable in an entirely precise manner. Legislation creating temporary tax changes was valued one-quarter as highly as legislation creating permanent tax changes.



48 For simplicity, all of the changes in general fund spending mentioned in this report are overall increases in spending, but the report card was scored on the basis of per capita change in spending. Also note that all spending data refer to state fiscal years rather than to calendar years.

 **ACT Party** : 



Last week, the prime minister was on the international stage and in the glare of global media where she normally excels. But she seriously stumbled by lecturing our friend and closest ally, Australia, about their climate change record. (This follows her earlier criticism of Australia’s immigration laws.) She also had a crack at our Pacific neighbours for not electing enough women to political roles. Why is the prime minister concerning herself with the domestic policies of foreign countries, especially when matters at home aren’t exactly rosy?



 **The Podcast**



In last week’s episode of Politics in Full Sentences, David, Brooke and Ruwan discussed why Jacinda Ardern has been lecturing our friends overseas, why Andrew Little called ACT’s three strikes law “fascism”, whether he will give prisoners the right to vote, and ACT’s new campaign for Fair Firearm Laws. 



**Economy in Trouble**



While Jacinda Ardern is happy to travel overseas and lecture other countries about climate change and identity politics, New Zealand’s economic growth is slowing, and her government’s policies are making the situation worse. **Labour has introduced or increased at least five taxes.** It is stifling freedom and opportunity by shutting down charter schools, banning offshore oil and gas exploration, and forcing entire industries to sign up to collective employment agreements. 



The wastefulness coming out of Wellington is worse than it has been for years – there’s free university for kids who don’t need it and Shane Jones is spending almost $1,000,000 to get each ‘neph’ off the couch (See below.) If New Zealand is to survive the next recession, government must get back to basics. Labour doesn’t know how to manage the economy. ACT has a plan to keep the economy growing with one low tax rate, by restraining red tape, and by cutting wasteful spending in Wellington.



 **‘Buy-Back’ Gets Old, Low-Powered Guns**



We’ve crunched the numbers and it appears the government’s gun ‘buy-back’ is failing. ACT understands only 15 per cent of military-style semi-automatic owners have attended a buy-back event, and in some cases, they’ve only handed in some of their firearms to test the water. According to Police:



 _7573 firearms owners have been processed, handing in a total of 10,844 prohibited firearms and 46,129 parts and accessories. The amount compensated to firearms owners is a total of $22.4 million._



According to the buy-back price list, the average part in ‘new or used condition’ is $179. If police paid the average for parts, then $8.3 million was spent on parts. That leaves $14.1 million to buy 10,844 firearms, or $1,300 each. According to the price list, however, the average centre-fire semi-automatic rifle – the type used in Christchurch – costs $2,556 in used condition. The conclusion is that the taxpayer is buying old and low-powered firearms in poor condition. The buy-back is not attracting high-powered firearms at all. In addition, the numbers suggest most people are handing in only one firearm. But if estimates of 1.5 million firearms and 250,000 licensed firearm owners are correct, the average person has six.



 **Fair Firearm Laws**



Last week, ACT launched a new campaign to restore dignity to our democracy. The government’s rushed, undemocratic gun laws treated 250,000 firearm owners with contempt. ACT has done what the government should have – we consulted with experts and the gun community to come up with sensible changes that balance the rights of law-abiding firearm owners and the need for public safety. More than 1,000 people signed up to the campaign in the first 48 hours. This support is critical as we build toward the 2020 election. Please [share our campaign](https://fairfirearmlaws.act.org.nz/) with your networks so we can turn 1,000 people into 10,000.



 **$1,000,000 a Job**



We’re used to politicians being wasteful with your money. National, under Steven Joyce and Simon Bridges, built a formidable corporate welfare machine. But Shane Jones is on another level. He has to spend $3,000,000 of your money _every single day_ to get through the $3 billion Provincial Growth Fund. Over the weekend, Jones said he had created “well over” 1000 jobs. If we assume 1500 jobs have been created, and with $1.38 billion of taxpayer money committed, you are paying almost $1,000,000 for every job created through the PGF. Jones promised to “get the nephs off the couch”, but we suspect that, with ACT’s 17.5 per cent company tax rate, firms could do a much better job at creating employment.



 **Bureaucratic Madness #1**



It’s déjà vu. The 2019 Rugby World Cup schedule means some games will be played outside bar licensing hours. Pubs and clubs are having to apply for special licenses but are being turned down by licensing committees. It seems wrong that they should have to apply for a special license and be knocked back when we know from 2015 that people watching the rugby at their local are not troublemakers. David didn’t enter politics to be the MP responsible for letting people watch rugby at their local every four years. But, if absolutely necessary, ACT will challenge parliament and the government to change the law so common sense can prevail.



 **Bureaucratic Madness #2**



Francie Perry is a constituent of David’s in Epsom. She has grown strawberries for 40 years and employs 1200 Kiwis. Her business requires overseas workers to pick berries because New Zealanders won’t do the work. The problem is that the immigration bureaucracy has blocked her from bringing workers into the country – even though this could put her out of business. This case encapsulates the disconnect between business and bureaucracy. Bureaucrats with power but without accountability can destroy livelihoods, killing off the entrepreneurial spirit our country depends upon as they go. TVNZ and Mike Hosking have covered the story.

Pretty shocking headline isn’t it! How dare I! How could I cast such a slur over the darling of the climate change activist movement? What could I possibly look to that would back up such a ludicrous conclusion?



Thank you for asking. Allow me to present my evidence. Before I do, please understand I don’t generally do politics, but my concerns mean I might have to. I have parents and in-laws, who are about the same age as Greta’s grandparents would be, that I love dearly. I don’t want to see anything bad happen to them due to the side effects of bad policies.



I cannot read Greta’s mind, so I am more than happy to believe she is sincere like so many who have bought into the Greenie ideology going around these days. But we must ask, how is it working out in the real world? One not governed by the utopian delusions of the political tree-huggers.



Greta advocates for environmentally sustainable energy sources. Nice sounding idea, but what are the side effects? The biggest one is sky rocketing power prices, despite political promises to the contrary. 



Wind, rain and sun just aren’t reliable, so coal, gas and nuclear power plants need to remain on “hot standby” (effectively still running) in case Mother Earth needs to go to the loo and can’t steer clouds around solar panels all the time. So, there is no money saved. Just extra construction and infrastructure costs.



Who does this affect the worst? The poor and the elderly. There are already so many horror stories about them turning off heaters because they cannot pay power bills and suffering from pneumonia or other winter chills. At least the young have the physiology to cope. The old don’t. They have quite often finished up in hospital and died years before their time.



But even that’s not the biggie.



The biggie is the government control and socialist restructuring required to implement all the fearmongering global environmental targets that people like Greta support. How has that worked out in the past? Who was it that said, “those who don’t learn from history will repeat it?” It was George Santayana in 1906.



Once large numbers of people start losing jobs, after socialist controls over anything remotely affecting the environment start bankrupting free market economies, the government is going to get one epic social welfare bill, without the economic activity to generate the money to pay for it.



Couple that with the medical bill that mass sickness because the elderly and others are unable to heat their homes (if they even get reliable electricity), and the government is going to fast run out of ethical options to cut costs.



There is one solution to this that has been seen before throughout history. Euthanasia. Economically it’s too easy. Suddenly there are trillions of dollars available to do other things to alleviate (or at least delay) suffering in other areas and to pacify angry voters.



Maybe that’s why some politicians are not quite as outraged by euthanasia as they used to be: once they see what the money saved on elderly care could do elsewhere. It’s too politically easy to justify it on the grounds of “alleviating suffering,” at least initially, then slowly slide down the slippery slope, allowing other excuses for it behind the scenes.



You don’t think they would dare do this? They will. They will have to. The alternative will either be being voted out for bankrupting the country or being booted out for not having the balls to make tough decisions.



I’m sure Greta herself would shudder to think of this. I’m sure she has grandparents whom she loves and who love her. I am sure the thought of them dying or being euthanised in a socialist dystopia would be unbearable.



Just like the thought of a loved one dying in a car crash caused by my bad driving would be unbearable to me. The problem is, once I have entered that corner too fast and started slipping off the road it’s too late. Braking, steering, accelerating only changes which side of the car goes over the edge first.



To avoid the accident, you must anticipate what could go wrong and slow down earlier. In the same way, we need to look at where Greenie scaremongering is taking us politically and select reverse sooner rather than later. By the time it’s all set up, and the desperate political elite run out of money and need to start taking the knife to their darling social programmes, it will be too late.

Readers may recall I reported last year on Al Gore’s attempt to prop up slumping viewership in his mishmash of programming satellite channel Current TV by hiring Keith Olbermann. It seems that idea didn’t work out well and I can’t say I’m unhappy with this news:

Founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt have issued a big bloviating statement saying that Elliot Spitzer will replace Olbermann which you can read here. Yeah, like anyone is going to watch that.
I got a kick out of this part of their statement: 
All of these additions to Current’s lineup are aimed at achieving one simple goal — the goal that has always been central to Current’s mission: To tell stories no one else will tell, to speak truth to power, and to influence the conversation of democracy on behalf of those whose voices are too seldom heard.
In that case Al, tell me when you are going to do a report on your “high school science” that couldn’t even get the basics right. See Al Gore and Bill Nye FAIL at doing a simple CO2 experiment. No one else seems to want to tell that story, so I’ll offer it to you free of charge, just say the word.
In related news, I also hear that Al Gore is exploring a new climate game show concept with these guys to be called “Wheel of Forecasts”…

Never mind carbon dioxide; the biggest threat to our children’s future is the cluster of economic arsonists creeping through our halls of power, their claws clutching shabby virtue like the awful [Tricoteuse](https://timeline.com/tricoteuse-french-revolution-b9887af073f4)[s](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tricoteuse&oq=Tricoteuse&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)[ ](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tricoteuse&oq=Tricoteuse&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)of Paris clutched knitting-needles in their crusted fingers while delightfully anticipating Madame Guillotine’s newest victim, enjoying the sport as whole sections of society are destroyed.



The Zero Carbon bill is the fuel to burn New Zealand’s house down, and like all socialist ideologically-driven disasters it will create division, resentment and misery that will spread like an inferno through every single piece of this green and pleasant land with middle New Zealand set to lose heavily.



Austin Mitchell observed this land and its people in the late 1960s, dubbing it the ‘Half-Gallon, Quarter Acre, Pavlova Paradise’. Under the shackle of the Zero Sense Bill we will, within thirty years, have become the ‘Half-baked, Quarter-trillion, Palaver Purgatory’.



Half-baked, because that’s what the idea that we can influence nature’s grand thermometer by altering the emissions profile of our little group of islands is. It is no more than a ridiculous tilt at an overwhelmingly powerful windmill, a force we don’t fully understand nor could ever hope to control. It is bloody ridiculous idea and **it is an indictment, an affront to common sense, that just a single MP voted against** the sanity-free document’s first reading in our parliament.



Quarter-trillion, because that’s what it’s going to cost us. A $247,500,000,000 – [by Treasury estimates](https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/risa/regulatory-impact-assessment-zero-carbon-bill) – restriction on our economy’s growth caused by attempting to restrict a tiny, harmless, trace-element component of this earth’s atmosphere. What madness is it called, in an age when every manifestation of insanity has a name, when we attempt to strangle ourselves in order to save our own breath?



What does a quarter-trillion mean in real terms? **It means $17,800 less,** every year, for each and every ‘average’ household in the country, except there is no ‘average’ household; the hurt will not be borne fairly, or squarely. The vandalism will strike some severely. Some entire industries will disappear as early as 2025. Some households will be devastated. Some entire communities will be placed on life-support for the entirety of their foreseeable future, and their children’s. ([Zero Carbon Bill Economic Analysis: A synthesis of economic impacts.](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/zero-carbon-bill-economic-analysis-synthesis-of-economic-impacts) Page 16, Table 5. Comparison of scenarios and key assumptions made across NZIER and Vivid. ‘Assumptions specific to each scenario’: “Closure of iron, steel and aluminium production in 2025”)



Both Treasury and the Ministry for the Environment have identified the hardest-hit under the Zero-Sense Bill – our earners. Producers will bear the brunt of increased costs and inhibited growth under the unhinged plan. The socialists will not care a jot about these people who are the backbone of our export earnings. They’ll simply say “go away and find a supplementary income stream”. The producers themselves may well say (but probably in much sterner terms), “Don’t you think that if I could find an income stream that would reward my family $17,800 per year for the next thirty years, that I would have already embraced it?” 



The other group of **hardest-hit will be our vulnerable.** Both Regulatory Impact Statements, Treasury’s and MoE, clearly identify our worst-off for markedly brutal side effects under the Zero Sense Bill. Some of these families have household incomes of under $35,000 already; how the hell will they cope with less – relatively, much, much less? 



While middle New Zealand will be forced to shell out for the afflicted economic quintiles 1 & 2 there will be limits before the extra taxation burdens start to cause further economic damage. At this point the chardonnay socialists will simply wave the poor off astern and forget about them, as ever socialists have done, caring not at all about equality of outcomes as long as they’re alright, Jack. This attitude is nicely summed up by Mr Mitchell in his book:



“With socialists equality is a matter of principle, until they reach power, when it’s a matter of amnesia.”



 **Palaver** , because that’s what this bill is – a whole lot of talk that will produce nothing and lead to none of its stated outcomes. I could have said Bullshit; perhaps I should have, but it doesn’t start with a P.



 **Purgatory** , because that’s what we will, as a society, become, a place of eternal punishment for trusting that these economically-illiterate goons would not deliberately harm the people of this country in such an utterly meaningless and comprehensively ridiculous way for not a grain of benefit.

"**The Urdd Eisteddfod - due to be hosted in Denbighshire - has been cancelled because of the Covid pandemic.**
The May 2021 event will be postponed until 2022 ""for the health and wellbeing of its members, volunteers and staff, as well as the public"".
The Urdd hopes to organise and stage an alternative, digital festival. Plans will be revealed in January.
The National Eisteddfod will decide in January whether to go ahead, after postponing in Ceredigion this year.
The Urdd said the virtual Eisteddfod T event will be held duringâ¯Whitsun half-term for children, young people and their families, following the success of this year's first-ever online version of the festival which attracted more than 6,000 competitors.
The Urdd Eisteddfod in Carmarthenshire will move to 2023 and Urdd Eisteddfod Maldwyn to 2024.
SiÃ¢n Eirian, acting director of the Urdd Eisteddfod, said there was ""no real alternative"" but to cancel next year's event.
""Under normal circumstances, very soon into the new year, schools, Urdd youth clubs and households alike would be busy preparing for the local and regional Eisteddfodau,"" she said.
""But the current restrictions in place would make it almost impossible for our contestants to prepare for these preliminary rounds, let alone stage them.""
""I am fully aware of the disappointment today's announcement brings to the volunteers in Denbighshire who have worked so tirelessly, not to mention the children and young people who were looking forward to returning to compete on stage,"" she said.
But she added the 2022 Eisteddfod falls on the Urdd's centenary, making it ""an extra special occasion"".
Gwenno Mair Davies, chair of the Urdd Eisteddfod and Arts Board, said everyone was ""longing"" for the festival to return and that 2022's would be ""a festival to remember""."

Whoo boy. Judith writes:
Muller bases his ‘conversion’ on the results of their recent paper?

So, how convincing is the analysis in Rohde et al.’s  new paper A new estimate of the average surface land temperature spanning 1753-2011?   Their analysis is based upon curve fits to volcanic forcing and the logarithm of the CO2 forcing (addition of solar forcing did not improve the curve fit.)
I have made public statements that I am unconvinced by their analysis.  I do not see any justification in their argument for making a stronger attribution statement than has been made by the IPCC AR4.    I have written MANY posts that critique the IPCC’s attribution analysis.  Here I try to give a sense of the challenges in attributing climate change to causal factors.

The first Earth Day was in 1970, and back then, many ‘apocalyptic’ predictions were made about the environment. Mark Perry at [Carpe Diem AEIdeas blog](https://www.thegwpf.com/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-made-around-the-time-of-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year/) has gone back and looked at them in order to present us with all the predictions that they got so spectacularly wrong 49 years ago.



1\. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”



2\. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.



3\. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”



4\. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of _Mademoiselle_. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”



5\. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”



6\. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”



7\. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of _The Living Wilderness_.



8\. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”



9\. In January 1970, _Life_ reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”



10\. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told _Time_ that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”



11\. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.



12\. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.



13\. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of _Audubon_ that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the [most recent CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm), life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).



14\. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.’”



15\. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in _Scientific American_ that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.



16\. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in _Look_ that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”



17\. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”



18\. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”



Today, we are still being bombarded with apocalyptic predictions about global warming and the rise of sea levels, so it is a good idea to bear in mind how badly wrong the doomsday prophets can get it.



Climate preacher/scientist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez predicted recently that “[We’re like… the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/426353-ocasio-cortez-the-world-will-end-in-12-years-if-we-dont-address).” You can add that to the spectacularly wrong predictions made this year around the time of Earth Day 2019.

"Icy winters and arid summers are creating salty soil. In some regions, increasing aridity concentrates naturally occurring salt in the soil, while in others, rising seawater has contaminated the groundwater with sea salt. New research suggests plants are riding a calcium wave just to survive in the increasingly salty, or saline, soils that have become a problem the world over.  Humans have contributed to increased soil salinity, as land and water use alters water tables, and human-influenced climate change shifts rainfall and air temperature patterns. While it seems counter-intuitive, even field irrigation increases soil salinity. All water applied to the soil contains some salt. As plants are unable to absorb salt, once evaporation removes the water the plant cannot use what is left is the salt, which builds up over time. During icy winters, salt is flung onto the ground in ever increasing quantities to manage snow and ice. Over the past 50 years the application of salt on roads and walkways has increased dramatically: in 1960, around three million tonnes of salt were spread on North American roads; today, that figure is 20 million tonnes. Come spring, rain runoff carries salt from the road and shoulders onto surrounding soils and into the water table. The cumulative effects of salt application to roadways and walkways are marked. Some freshwater river watersheds have seen salt levels rise between 100% and 250%. And these levels rise every year. This poses a significant problem as salt is, generally speaking, toxic to plants – as many a school student will have conclusively demonstrated in classroom experiments, and “salting the earth” was a tactic used by victorious armies to punish their foes and make it harder to reinhabit the land. Rooted to the spot, plants cannot escape the toxic effects of salt, so rising salinity is a serious risk to both crop production, and more widely an entire ecosystem’s health. Recent research by Won-Gyu Choi and his colleagues, in the laboratory of Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin, has found that calcium plays a key element in plants’ initial response to salt. When plants sense salt they respond by creating a “calcium wave”, an elevated concentration of calcium ions that passes in a ripple from the point of salt perception, throughout the plant. The wave is created by the release of calcium that the plants store within their cells. The study’s authors used a novel system to observe changes in calcium within plant cells, by engineering plants that would create a protein that fluoresces according to the level of calcium present. When they exposed plant roots to various stimuli including cold, touch, or  stress, the plants generally responded with elevated calcium concentrations at the point of application. When roots sensed salt, calcium rose at the point of contact, followed by neighbouring cells in a continuous wave travelling at two cells per second throughout the plant. The calcium wave travelled from the roots all the way to the tips of the shoots and leaves above ground within two minutes. When the plants’ shoots received the signal, they altered what they were doing. In fact, they mounted what might best be described as a defence response. Having received the calcium wave message, plant tissues reconfigured their cellular functions – manufacturing new molecules that help the plant contend with salt, by adjusting water balance within the plant, and setting up barriers to salt invasion of the plant tissues. The authors are  certain that it was the calcium wave that created this response by using chemicals that inhibited the passage of calcium. Won-Gyu Choi and colleagues speculated that the calcium is released from a special compartment within the cell, stored for this purpose. This requires the action of special proteins, which form a pore that opens in order to release calcium from the compartment. Examining plants where the pore proteins no longer functioned, they found the calcium wave no longer travelled properly through the plant. Without the ability to create this calcium wave transmission, they found those plants were unable to mount a defence against salt. These plants also exhibited poor growth in the presence of salt relative to normal plants. Won-Gyu Choi and colleagues discovery has revealed an important mechanism that plants use to contend with salty soil. The calcium wave that plants create in their roots to inform the rest of the plant that salty times are ahead has striking similarities to our nervous system.  In humans, calcium is also used to signal from one neuron to another when we experience stress, such as pain. When you get salt in a wound, the signals your brain receives also have a calcium wave element to them, as firing neurons trigger each other in a chain reaction that carries information from peripheral nerves to the brain in a fraction of a second. It turns out plants are using an analogous system to transmit information about salt stress, but rather than being received by a centralised brain, they inform every cell of the plant’s body.  Hopefully, we will be able to use this information in future to help plants alleviate the stress caused by salty soils and better contend with a saline environment – as long as we’re planning to eat plants, or animals that feed on them, we will need to give them all the help we can."

One of the classic examples of the failure of politicians to communicate with the citizenry is found in a video of Romanian tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu, giving what turned out to be his last speech to the teeming masses gathered in a square in Bucharest.



Oblivious to the mood of the people, Ceausescu is at his bombastic, self‐​important best until he realizes that the chants from the crowd below are not praise, but something rather to the contrary.



The look on his face: priceless.



You could say that Sen. Robert Bennett, R‐​Utah, and Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.V., have just experienced their Ceausescu moments. Both longtime incumbents were booted from office by their constituents Tuesday in a fashion that, while not quite as bloody as Ceausescu’s departure, was still pretty gory in political terms.





The political class seems to believe they have carte blanche to do as they please.



America is a democratic republic, complete with an excellent Constitution that politicians still feel compelled to acknowledge, if not take seriously. So the growing communications gap between voters in places like Utah and West Virginia and the politicians who have been “representing” them, while worrisome, is not irreparable. Solving it should be a high priority for all involved.



The communication problem involves the accelerating realization on the part of many Americans that the essence of America, namely, a respect for the dignity of the individual, which inherently involves the government leaving the individual alone, has been pretty much forgotten by politicians in Washington, D.C., the state capitals and city councils around the nation.



Which explains why public employees now make on average 30% more than their private sector counterparts — and 70% more in benefits.



The political class seems to believe they have carte blanche to do as they please. While they have been turning a deaf ear to increasingly vocal expressions of frustration by the American people, if the trend in primary voting continues, our Washington elite may just be jarred awake.



Examples abounded even before Utah and West Virginia made their statements this week. Take the town hall meeting in Washington state last summer in which a young Marine veteran said to six‐​term Rep. Brian Baird, “Now I heard you say tonight about educating our children, indoctrinating our children, whatever you want to call it.”



The congressman denied wanting to indoctrinate, but the young father simply responded, “Stay away from my kids.”



Virtually all of the 400 or so people in the hall rose as one in loud applause.



It was another Ceausescu moment. The congressman had no clue the people of his district weren’t interested in the federal government concerning itself with the education of their children.



The Declaration of Independence says governments are created to secure our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In other words, to leave us the hell alone. That is what makes for American Exceptionalism, despite President Obama’s claim that all nations are exceptional. No, they are not, not in the way America is.



Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton demonstrated clearly how most politicians don’t understand this when she said on MSNBC, “When I ask people, ‘What do you think the goals of America are today?’ people don’t have any idea. We don’t know what we’re trying to achieve.”



America to Hillary: It doesn’t take a village; we get along fine when we each strive to achieve our own goals, thank you very much.



As I write these words, across my desk comes a press release from Bloomberg telling me that 18‐​term Rep. Henry Waxman wants Congress to ban the use of smokeless tobacco in Major League Baseball dugouts. This is part of our communications problem. Read my lips, Henry: It is none of Congress’ business if baseball players want to use smokeless tobacco (or any other kind of weed, for that matter).



And this is the encouraging thing about the Tea Party movement. It is made up of average Americans who are sick to death of politicians regulating, taxing, controlling and limiting individual choice.



This bipartisan communications problem is also exemplified by a joint press conference held just before the start of the lamentable 111th Congress by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Said Reid, “Sen. McConnell and I believe … that we are going to work in a bipartisan basis … to solve the problems of the American people.”



Whoa! See how simple the communications problem is? They think we sent them to Congress to solve our problems when we sent them there to see to it that we are left alone to solve our own problems. Add to that the fact that many of our problems have been created by Congress, and we have the basis for a healthy, peaceful revolution.



Some 85% of Americans like their health care, so Congress shoves a government‐ mandated system down our throats. Taxes are way too burdensome, so Congress is contemplating a value‐​added tax to add to our burden. We spend billions of dollars on wars in the Middle East for no rational reason. Climate change proves to be a wildly exaggerated issue, yet Congress still plans on raising taxes on energy to solve this nonexistent problem.



The list is long, and the frustration grows daily.



Talk about a failure to communicate. According to a recent Pew Research Center Poll, 78% of Americans don’t trust the federal government. As Ronald Reagan famously put it, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’ ”

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a monthly series in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.



The recent publication of two articles in _Nature_ magazine proclaiming a link to rainfall extremes (and flooding) to global warming, added to the heat in Russia and the floods in Pakistan in the summer of 2010, and the back‐​to‐​back cold and snowy winters in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, have gotten a lot of public attention. This includes a recent hearing in the House of Representatives, despite its Republican majority. Tying weather extremes to global warming, or using them as “proof” that warming doesn’t exist (see: snowstorms), is a popular rhetorical flourish by politicos of all stripes. 



The hearing struck many as quite odd, inasmuch as it is much clearer than apocalyptic global warming that the House is going to pass meaningless legislation commanding the EPA to cease and desist from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. “Meaningless” means that it surely will not become law. Even on the long‐​shot probability that it passes the Senate, the President will surely veto, and there are nowhere near enough votes to override such an action.



Perhaps “wolf!” has been cried yet again. A string of soon‐​to‐​be‐​published papers in the scientific literature finds that despite all hue and cry about global warming and recent extreme weather events, natural climate variability is to blame.



Where to start? How about last summer’s Russian heat wave?



The Russian heat wave (and to some degree the floods in Pakistan) have been linked to the same large‐​scale, stationary weather system, called an atmospheric “blocking” pattern. When the atmosphere is “blocked” it means that it stays in the same configuration for period of several weeks (or more) and keeps delivering the same weather to the same area for what can seem like an eternity to people in the way. Capitalizing on the misery in Russia and Pakistan, atmospheric blocking was added to the list of things that were supposed to be “consistent with” anthropogenically stimulated global warming which already, of course included heat waves and floods. And thus the Great Russian Heat Wave of 2010 became part of global warming lore.



But then a funny thing happened — scientists with a working knowledge of atmospheric dynamics started to review the situation and found scant evidence for global warming.



The first chink in the armor came back in the fall of 2010, when scientists from the Physical Sciences Division (PSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented the results of their preliminary investigation on the web  [1], and concluded that “[d]espite this strong evidence for a warming planet, **greenhouse gas forcing fails to explain the 2010 heat wave over western Russia**. The natural process of atmospheric blocking, and the climate impacts induced by such blocking, are the principal cause for this heat wave.”



The PSD folks have now followed this up with a new peer‐​reviewed article in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ that rejects the global warming explanation. The paper is titled “Was There a Basis for Anticipating the 2010 Russian Heat Wave?” Turns out that there wasn’t.



To prove this, the research team, led by PSD’s Randall Dole, first reviewed the observed temperature history of the region affected by the heat wave (western Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine, and the Baltic nations). To start, they looked at the recent antecedent conditions: “Despite record warm globally‐​averaged surface temperatures over the first six months of 2010, Moscow experienced an unusually cold winter and a relatively mild but variable spring, providing no hint of the record heat yet to come.” Nothing there.



Then they looked at the long‐​term temperature record: “The July surface temperatures for the region impacted by the 2010 Russian heat wave shows no significant warming trend over the prior 130‐​year period from 1880 to 2009… . A linear trend calculation yields a total temperature change over the 130 years of -0.1Â°C (with a range of 0 to -0.4Â°C over the four data sets [they examined]).” There’s not a hint of a build‐​up to a big heat wave.



And as to the behavior of temperature extremes: “There is also no clear indication of a trend toward increasing warm extremes. The prior 10 warmest Julys are distributed across the entire period and exhibit only modest clustering earlier in this decade, in the 1980s and in the 1930s… . This behavior differs substantially from globally averaged annual temperatures, for which eleven of the last twelve years ending in 2006 rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record since 1850… .”



With regard any indication that “global” warming was pushing temperatures higher in Russia and thus helped to fuel the extreme heat last summer, Dole et al. say this: “With no significant long‐​term trend in western Russia July surface temperatures detected over the period 1880–2009, mean regional temperature changes are thus very unlikely to have contributed substantially to the magnitude of the 2010 Russian heat wave.”



Next the PSD folks looked to see if the existing larger‐​scale antecedent conditions, fed into climate models would produce the atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e. blocking) that gave rise to the heat wave. The tested “predictors” included patterns of sea surface temperature and arctic ice coverage, which most people feel have been subject to some human influence. No relationship: “These findings suggest that the blocking and heat wave were not primarily a forced response to specific boundary conditions during 2010.”



In fact, the climate models exhibited no predilection for projecting increases in the frequency of atmospheric blocking patterns over the region as greenhouse gas concentrations increased. Just the opposite: “Results using very high‐​resolution climate models suggest that the number of Euro‐​Atlantic blocking events will decrease by the latter half of the 21st century.”



At this point, Dole and colleagues had about exhausted all lines of inquiry and summed things up:



Our analysis points to a primarily natural cause for the Russian heat wave. This event appears to be mainly due to internal atmospheric dynamical processes that produced and maintained an intense and long‐​lived blocking event. Results from prior studies suggest that it is likely that the intensity of the heat wave was further increased by regional land surface feedbacks. The absence of long‐​term trends in regional mean temperatures and variability together with the model results indicate that it is very unlikely that warming attributable to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations contributed substantially to the magnitude of this heat wave.



Can’t be much clearer than that.



But that was last summer. What about the past two winters? Both were very cold in the eastern U.S. with record snows events and/​or totals scattered about the country.



Cold, snow, and global warming? On Christmas Day 2010, the _New York Times_ ran an op‐​ed by Judah Cohen, a long‐​range forecaster for the private forecasting firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research, outlining his theory as to how late summer Arctic ice declines lead to more fall snow cover across Siberia which in turn induces atmospheric circulation patterns to favor snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S. Just last week, the Union of Concerned Scientists held a news conference where they handed out a press release [2] headlined “Climate Change Makes Major Snowstorms Likely.” In that release, Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, laid out his theory as to how the loss of Arctic sea ice is helping to provide more moisture to fuel winter snowstorms across the U.S. as well as altering atmospheric circulation patterns into a preferred state for big snowstorms. Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters chimed in with “Heavy snowstorms are not inconsistent with a warming planet.”



As is the wont for this _Wisdom_ , let’s go back to the scientific literature.



Another soon‐​to‐​be released paper to appear in _Geophysical Research Letters_ describes the results of using the seasonal weather prediction model from the European Center for Medium‐​Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to help untangle the causes of the unusual atmospheric circulation patterns that gave rise to the harsh winter of 2009–2010 on both sides of the Atlantic. A team of ECMWF scientists led by Thomas Jung went back and did experiments changing initial conditions that were fed into the ECMWF model and then assessed how well the model simulated the known weather patterns of the winter of 2009–2010. The different set of initial conditions was selected so as to test all the pet theories behind the origins of the harsh winter. Jung et al. describe their investigations this way: “Here, the origin and predictability of the unusual winter of 2009/10 are explored through numerical experimentation with the ECMWF Monthly forecasting system. More specifically, the role of anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice, the tropical atmospheric circulation, the stratospheric polar vortex, solar insolation and near surface temperature (proxy for snow cover) are examined.”



Here is what they found after running their series of experiments.



 _Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies_. These are often associated with global warming caused by people. Finding: “These results suggest that neither SST nor sea ice anomalies explain the negative phase of the NAO during the 2009/10 winter.”



(NAO are the commonly used initials for the North Atlantic Oscillation — and atmospheric circulation pattern that can act to influence winter weather in the eastern U.S. and western Europe. A negative phase of the NAO is associated with cold and stormy weather and during the winter of 2009-10, the NAO value was the lowest ever observed.)



 _A global warming‐​induced weakening stratospheric (upper‐​atmosphere) jetstream_. “Like for the other experiments, these stratospheric relaxation experiments fail to reproduce the magnitude of the observed NAO anomaly.”



 _Siberian snow cover._ “The resulting [upper air patterns] show little resemblance with the observations… . The implied weak role of snow cover anomalies is consistent with other research… .”



 _Solar variability._ “The experiments carried out in this study suggest that the impact of anomalously low incoming [ultraviolet] radiation on the tropospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region are very small… suggesting that the unusually low solar activity contributed little, if any, to the observed NAO anomaly during the 2009/10 winter.”



Ok then, well what did cause the unusual weather patterns during the 2009-10 winter?



The results of this study, therefore, increase the likelihood that both the development and persistence of negative NAO phase resulted from internal atmospheric dynamical processes.



Translation: Random variability.



To drive this finding home, here’s another soon‐​to‐​be‐​released paper (D’Arrigo et al., 2001) that uses tree ring‐​based reconstructions of atmospheric circulation patterns and finds a similar set of conditions (including a negative NAO value second only to the 2009-10 winter) was responsible for the historically harsh winter of 1783–84 in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, which was widely noted by historians. It followed the stupendous eruption of the Icelandic volcano Laki the previous summer. The frigid and snowy winter conditions have been blamed on the volcano. In fact, Benjamin Franklin even commented as much.



But in their new study, Roseanne D’Arrigo and colleagues conclude that the harshness of that winter primarily was the result of anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns that closely resembled those observed during the winter of 2009-10, and that the previous summer’s volcanic eruption played a far less prominent role:



Our results suggest that Franklin and others may have been mistaken in attributing winter conditions in 1783–4 mainly to Laki or another eruption, rather than unforced variability.



Similarly, conditions during the 2009-10 winter likely resulted from natural [atmospheric] variability, not tied to greenhouse gas forcing… Evidence thus suggests that these winters were linked to the rare but natural occurrence of negative NAO and El NiÃ±o events.



The point is that natural variability can and does produce extreme events on every time scale, from days (e.g., individual storms), weeks (e.g., the Russian heat wave), months (e.g., the winter of 2009-10), decades (e.g., the lack of global warming since 1998), centuries (e.g., the Little Ice Age), millennia (e.g., the cycle of major Ice Ages), and eons (e.g., snowball earth).



Folks would do well to keep this in mind next time global warming is being posited for the weather disaster _du jour_. Almost assuredly, it is all hype and little might.



Too bad these results weren’t given a “hearing” in the House!

Guest Post by Ira Glickstein
The Unified Theory of Climate post is exciting and could shake the world of Climate Science to its roots. I would love it if the conventional understanding of the Atmospheric “Greenhouse” Effect (GHE) presented by the Official Climate Team could be overturned, and that would be the case if the theory of Ned Nikolov and Karl Zeller, both PhDs, turns out to be scientifically correct.
Sadly, it seems to me they have made some basic mistakes that, among other faults, confuse cause and effect. I appreciate that WUWT is open to new ideas, and I support the decision to publish this theory, along with both positive and negative comments by readers.

Correlation does not prove causation. For example, the more policemen directing traffic, the worse the jam is. Yes, when the police and tow trucks first respond to an accident they may slow the traffic down a bit until the disabled automobiles are removed. However, there is no doubt the original cause of the jam was the accident, and the reason police presence is generally proportional to the severity of the jam level is that more or fewer are ordered to respond. Thus, Accident >>CAUSES>> Traffic Jam >>CAUSES>> Police is the correct interpretation. 
Al Gore made a similar error when, in his infamous movie An Inconvenient Truth, he made a big deal about the undoubted corrrelation in the Ice Core record between CO2 levels and Temperature without mentioning the equally apparent fact that Temperatures increase and decrease hundreds of years before CO2 levels follow suit.
While it is true that rising CO2 levels do have a positive feedback that contributes to slightly increased Temperatures, the primary direction of causation is Temperature >>CAUSES>> CO2. The proof is in the fact that, in each Glacial cycle, Temperatures begin their rapid decline precisely when CO2 levels are at their highest, and rapid Temperature increase is initiated exactly when CO2 levels are their lowest. Thus, Something Else >>CAUSES>> Temperature>>CAUSES>> CO2. Further proof may be had by placing an open can of carbonated beverage in the refigerator and another on the table, and noting that the “fizz” (CO2) outgasses more rapidly from the can at room temperature.
Moving on to Nikolov, the claim appears to be that the pressure of the Atmosphere is the main cause of temperature changes on Earth. The basic claim is PRESSURE >>CAUSES>>TEMPERATURE.
PV = nRT
Given a gas in a container, the above formula allows us to calculate the effect of changes to the following variables: Pressure (P), Volume (V), Temperature (T, in Kelvins), and Number of molecules (n). (R is a constant.)
The figure shows two cases involving a sealed, non-insulated container, with a Volume, V, of air:
(A) Store that container of air in the ambient cool Temperature Tr of a refrigerator. Then, increase the Number n of molecules in the container by pumping in more air. the Pressure (P) within the container will increase. Due to the work done to compress the air in the fixed volume container, the Temperature within the container will also increase from (Tr) to some higher value. But, please note, when we stop increasing n, both P and T in the container will stabilize. Then, as the container, warmed by the work we did compressing the air, radiates, conducts, and convects that heat to the cool interior of the refrigerator, the Temperature slowly decreases back to the original Tr.
(B) We take a similar container from the cool refrigerator at Temperature Tr and place it on a kitchen chair, where the ambient Temperature Tk is higher. The container is warmed by radiation, conduction and convection and the Temperature rises asymptotically towards Tk. The Pressure P rises slowly and stabilizes at some higher level. Please note the pressure remains high forever so long as the temperature remains elevated.
In case (A) Pressure >>CAUSES A TEMPORARY>> increase in Temperature.
In case (B) Temperature >>CAUSES A PERMANENT>> increase in Pressure.
I do not believe any reader will disagree with this highly simplified thought experiment. Of course, the Nikolov theory is far more complex, but, I believe it amounts to confusing the cause, namely radiation from the Sun and Downwelling Long-Wave Infrared (LW DWIR) from the so-called “Greenhouse” gases (GHG) in the Atmosphere with the effect, Atmospheric pressure.
Some Red Flags in the Unified Theory
1) According to Nikolov, our Atmosphere
“… boosts Earth’s surface temperature not by 18K—33K as currently assumed, but by 133K!”
If, as Nikolov claims, the Atmosphere boosts the surface temperature by 133K, then, absent the Atmosphere the Earth would be 288K – 133K = 155K. This is contradicted by the fact that the Moon, which has no Atmosphere and is at the same distance from the Sun as our Earth, has an average temperature of about 250K. Yes, the albedo of the Moon is 0.12 and that of the Earth is 0.3, but that difference would make the Moon only about 8K cooler than an Atmosphere-free Earth, not 95K cooler! Impossible!
2) In the following quote from Nikolov, NTE is “Atmospheric Near-Surface Thermal Enhancement” and SPGB is a “Standard Planetary Gray Body”
NTE should not be confused with an actual energy, however, since it only defines the relative (fractional) increase of a planet’s surface temperature above that of a SPGB. Pressure by itself is not a source of energy! Instead, it enhances (amplifies) the energy supplied by an external source such as the Sun through density-dependent rates of molecular collision. This relative enhancement only manifests as an actual energy in the presence of external heating. [Emphasis added]
This, it seems to me, is an admission that the source of energy for their “Atmospheric Near-Surface Thermal Enhancement” process comes from the Sun, and, therefore, their “Enhancement” is as they admit, not “actual energy”. I would add the energy that would otherwise be lost to space (DW LWIR) to the energy from the Sun, eliminating any need for the “Thermal Enhancement” provided by Atmospheric pressure.
3) As we know when investigating financial misconduct, follow the money. Well, in Climate Science we follow the Energy. We know from actual measurements (see my Visualizing the “Greenhouse” Effect – Emission-Spectra) the radiative energy and spectra of Upwelling Long-Wave Infrared (UW LWIR), from the Surface to the so-called “greenhouse” gases (GHG) in the Atmosphere, and the Downwelling (DW LWIR) from those gases back to the Surface.
The only heed Nikolov seems to give to GHG and those measured radiative energies is that they are insufficient to raise the temperature of the Surface by 133K.
… our atmosphere boosts Earth’s surface temperature not by 18K—33K as currently assumed, but by 133K! This raises the question: Can a handful of trace gases which amount to less than 0.5% of atmospheric mass trap enough radiant heat to cause such a huge thermal enhancement at the surface? Thermodynamics tells us that this not possible.
Of course not! Which is why the conventional explanation of the GHE is that the GHE raises the temperature by only about 33K (or perhaps a bit less -or more- but only a bit and definitely not 100K!).
4) Nikolov notes that, based on “interplanetary data in Table 1” (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Europe, Titan, Triton):
… we discovered that NTE was strongly related to total surface pressure through a nearly perfect regression fit…
Of course, one would expect planets and moons in our Solar system to have some similarities.
“… the atmosphere does not act as a ‘blanket’ reducing the surface infrared cooling to space as maintained by the current GH theory, but is in and of itself a source of extra energy through pressure. This makes the GH effect a thermodynamic phenomenon, not a radiative one as presently assumed!
I just cannot square this assertion with the clear measurements of UW and DW LWIR, and the fact that the wavelengths involved are exactly those of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other GHGs.
Equation (7) allows us to derive a simple yet robust formula for predicting a planet’s mean surface temperature as a function of only two variables – TOA solar irradiance and mean atmospheric surface pressure,…”
Yes, TOA solar irradiance would be expected to be important in predicting mean surface temperature, but mean atmospheric surface pressure, it seems to me, would more likely be a result than a cause of temperature. But, I could be wrong.
Conclusion
I, as much as anyone else here at WUWT, would love to see the Official Climate Team put in its proper place. I think climate (CO2) sensitivity is less than the IPCC 2ºC to 4.5ºC, and most likely below 1ºC. The Nikolov Unified Climate Theory goes in the direction of reducing climate sensitivity, apparently even making it negative, but, much as I would like to accept it, I remain unconvinced. Nevertheless, I congratulate Nikolov and Zeller for having the courage and tenacity to put this theory forward. Perhaps it will trigger some other alternative theory that will be more successful.

UPDATE: I’ve added a video at the end that speaks to the consensus thinking. Marc Morano’s arguments leaves the Australian Youth Climate Coalition’s Anna Rose speechless. – Anthony
Guest post by Dr. Tim Ball
A 2005 photograph of James Lovelock, scientist and author best known for the Gaia hypothesis. Photograph taken by Bruno Comby of Association of Environmentalists For Nuclear Energy. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)

Claims of a consensus was an early sign climate science was political. It was used to support official science of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a public relations campaign to offset and divert from bad science, inadequate data, and incorrect assumptions. It’s in use again as the science of the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis fails and people are not persuaded.
Many scientists were fooled, including James Lovelock, a central figure to environmentalism with his Gaia hypothesis. In 2007 he said,
“Before this century is over, billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic.”
Recently he revised his view;
“The problem is we don’t know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn’t happened.”
“We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now.”
How could a reputable scientist be so wrong?

Some words have different meanings for the public than for professionals. For example, calling someone a skeptic is considered derogatory, yet it’s a necessity for a scientist. When warming became climate change skeptics became deniers, a nasty ambiguous word. It means you refuse to acknowledge information, but it’s specifically used for a few who deny the holocaust, arguably the most horrendous event in history.
There’s a negative implication to the word consensus. If you’re not part of it you’re out-of-step, stupid, antisocial, or all three. There’s no consensus in science. Even in politics it’s rare to assign a number to a consensus. Apparently to pretend credibility current users say there’s a 97 percent consensus about IPCC climate science.
Numerical measures of the consensus argument appeared early in climate As I recall, approximately 6000 people associated with the IPCC represented the original consensus. That number decreased to 2500 today, but they’re still the consensus according to RealClimate, the web site about which Michael Mann wrote in a 2004 email,
“…the important thing is to make sure they’re loosing (sic) the PR battle. That’s what the site is about.”
A 16 December 2004 entry asks,
“Is there really “consensus” in the scientific community on the reality of anthropogenic climate change?”
Evidence used was the now discredited study of Naomi Oreske that claimed of 928 articles selected objectively by a three word google search, 100 percent supported IPCC science.
On 22 December 2004 there’s another RealClimate insight;
We’ve used the term “consensus” here a bit recently without ever really defining what we mean by it. In normal practice, there is no great need to define it – no science depends on it. But it’s useful to record the core that most scientists agree on, for public presentation. The consensus that exists is that of the IPCC reports, in particular the working group I report (there are three WG’s. By “IPCC”, people tend to mean WG I).
This admits consensus is unnecessary in science, but necessary for climate science “for public presentation” or propaganda.
It’s another circular argument that pervade IPCC science and politics. For example, they hypothesize that CO2 causes temperature increase, program a computer model accordingly, then say the model proves that CO2 increase causes temperature increase. RealClimate says,
“The main points that most would agree on as “the consensus” are:
1.The earth is getting warmer (0.6 +/- 0.2 oC in the past century; 0.1 0.17 oC/decade over the last 30 years (see update)) [ch 2]
2.People are causing this [ch 12] (see update)
3.If GHG emissions continue, the warming will continue and indeed accelerate [ch 9]
4.(This will be a problem and we ought to do something about it)
I’ve put those four points in rough order of certainty. The last one is in brackets because whilst many would agree, many others (who agree with 1-3) would not, at least without qualification. It’s probably not a part of the core consensus in the way 1-3 are.”
So the consensus is their IPCC Reports.
Here are the facts of the consensus today.
1.The rise of 0.6°C has an error of ±0.2°C or 33 percent – which is scientifically meaningless. Phil Jones a senior member of the IPCC produced the number. The earth is not warming any more.
2.The only evidence people are the cause is in their computer models.
3. Temperature increase precedes CO2 increase in every single record anywhere, except in their computer models.
4.An application of the precautionary principle.
RealClimate said about consensus,
“In normal practice, there is no great need to define it – no science depends on it.”
But climate science of the IPCC and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at East Anglia was not normal practice: a political consensus was their only hope. As Michael Crichton said,
Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled.
Sounds familiar; the science is settled, and the debate is over because there’s a consensus.

It is amusing to listen to those involved in the business of public transport like the degreed so-called experts at Auckland Transport. You know the ones, straight out of university, who Phil Twyford thinks are as dumb as he is. In the case of Auckland Transport, he just might be not too far off the mark. Then there are the journalist ideologues like Simon Wilson. They all seem to be possessed with simplistic logic, to a degree brought about by an unhealthy obsession with climate change. They think that getting cars off the road and increasing all forms of public transport is going to solve all sorts of problems to do with our planet.



They love to spout figures referring to the increased number of passenger trips taken on trains and buses over the last fifteen years or so. These figures are presented in such a way that, in the morning and afternoon peak traffic times, you would expect to be the only vehicle on the motorway. This is not to question the accuracy of their figures but rather the myth that these increased numbers of public transport passenger trips are solving the gridlock on the motorways and major suburban roads. No one would argue that they’re helping, but they’re not and never will be the answer.



Some figures that they would like hidden will tell you why. According to a Boston Consulting Group report commissioned by Uber and released in March this year, peak hour travelling now lengthens Auckland car trips by 48%, just pipping Sydney as the worst in Australasia. The report found that 90% of the population travel in cars compared to just 5% who use public transport. This is the figure that needs to be taken notice of rather than the increased high fives figure of passenger trips taken. Nicky Preston, head of communications at Uber, says they found that 54% of Aucklanders own more than one car.



According to government modelling, 40% more of Auckland’s roads will be severely congested by 2049 if no action is taken. So what is Auckland Transport’s answer? No prizes for guessing. They’re taking action to improve public transport in the region, a project I thought they’d just completed. They now have copious numbers of buses belching diesel fumes into the air, many outside of peak times with only two or three people in them.



Auckland Transport’s Mark Lambert says “We all know congestion is getting pretty bad in Auckland and it has been getting worse, we’ve been working on a lot of things, particularly public transport.” Interestingly Auckland Transport’s own figures show that it’s still quicker to get to the CBD by car in the morning peak from at least half of the six centres it monitors. The reports suggests car pooling and e-scooters as part of the solution. **Papakura or Albany to the city on an E-scooter?**



A report published in July by the Automobile Association said the average Aucklander wasted about 85 hours sitting in traffic last year, up from 79 hours in 2017. The AA predicts by 2028 Auckland will have 300,000 more people and 250,000 more cars. AA spokesman Barney Irvine says most of the growth will be in the outer suburbs with limited public transport, work and study options. He says what it all adds up to is much more driving and that means much more congestion.



In the next nine years, according to the AA, the passenger transport share of trips made will have increased from 5% to 7%, a measly 2%. This is where all the talk of great increases in numbers of passenger transport trips made, in my view, doesn’t paint the full picture and is to a degree misleading. Great for the transport boffins and Mayor Goff though.



Wellington is not much better off with bureaucrats seemingly unable to run a bus service. It reminds me of an episode of Yes Minister where a top politician asked if anyone had seen a bus timetable to which Jim Hacker replied by asking if a bus driver had ever seen a bus timetable. You’d think Grant Robertson’s partner Alf would be able to offer some meaningful advice. Wellington has five train lines but 85% of the people travelling only use two of them. Poses the question, is it worth keeping the others operational?



Both Auckland and Wellington are crying out for road improvements but requests from those in the know for what should happen are falling on deaf ears. The government, councils and those running transport in both cities need to wake up to the fact that public transport is not a solution to gridlock. The Hamilton to Auckland slow coach express with its 150 ghost passengers won’t do anything to reduce motorway congestion either.



Mr Twyford and his assistant, Ms Genter, need to get their heads out of the climate change sand and take a leaf out of Megan Woods’s book with her housing dashboard. They need a roading dashboard and to start building quick smart.

"Coral reefs: fragile, delicate, and in danger? Actually coral reefs can be the first line in defence against incoming storms, reducing the power of incoming waves by 97%, even during hurricane-force winds. Most (86%) of this wave energy reduction happens at the reef crest, a thin narrow band at the highest point of the reef where waves break first. Our study published in the journal Nature Communications found that the risk reduction provided by reefs is relevant to some 200m people worldwide, and it is these people that may have to bear the costs if reefs continue to be degraded. These are the people in the villages, towns, and cities in low-lying, risk-prone coastal areas below 10 metres elevation and within 50km of coral reefs, mostly in Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. You may be surprised to learn that the US is ranked seventh on this list of nations, due to the high density of cities living near the reefs around south-east Florida. We conducted a more conservative analysis, looking at only those living below 10 metres elevation and within just 10km of a reef, which still represents 100m people.  The risk these people face is growing because of the rate of coastal development and climate change, compounded by reef loss and degradation in tropical areas. Reef degradation, particularly the kind that we have seen across the Caribbean has particularly devastating effects. Small reductions in the height of reefs, particularly at the reef crest, means substantially greater wave energy passes through the reef to strike the coastline. If you reduce the height of a breakwater that runs the length of your coast by 30cm (12 inches) – and the loss on coral reefs has sometimes measured much more – then you can expect to see a major impact on the coastlines. But there is reason for optimism. At a time when towns, cities and countries are making major investments in climate and weather-related hazard protection, we found that coral reef protection makes economic, ecological and practical, risk-reduction sense. The average cost of building artificial breakwaters is US$19,791 per metre, compared to $1,290 per metre for projects focused on coral reef restoration. And of course healthy coral also provides a beautiful tourist attraction and has other benefits for fisheries. But this restoration has to be done properly. Treating coral reef conservation as a joint exercise with storm risk reduction is a new field of science and practical application. It would pay to heed the lessons of past projects that have sought to use other habitats in this way. Tsunamis and storms across the Indian and Pacific oceans in recent years have spurred much interest in restoring mangroves as a storm defence, for example, but some of the mangrove restoration has been poorly conceived – for example, by planting mangroves as “bioshields” in places where they did not naturally occur. These projects are doomed to failure as the mangroves generally die. On this basis, we don’t suggest creating new reefs in places they did not naturally occur. Reef restoration will almost certainly require adding to the height and complexity of existing reefs in order to enhance their wave-breaking power. There will inevitably be trade-offs to make between the conservation and risk-reduction goals. Cautious conservation may favour using reef rubble or natural materials to grow the reef, but if these are unavailable, cement or rocks might have to do to. To deliver actual risk reduction means improving those reefs that will protect the most people – not necessarily the most remote and diverse reefs that have often been the focus of conservation. We know that corals can recover. There has been significant recovery in many places around the world from the severe coral bleaching that occurred in the extremely warm El Niño year of 1998. Recovery was most sustained where other stresses on the reef, such as pollution, were managed well. Done well, restoring reefs can be money well spent with many benefits. We shouldn’t be investing just in grey infrastructure like seawalls and breakwaters that will further degrade coastal habitats. Instead we have the opportunity to also invest cost effectively in “blue” ecological infrastructure – the sea wall nature has provided us."

Welcome to the WUWT Sports channel! For the debut game we have “The Cause” vs. “The Skeptics”:
First inning: Gavin Schmidt is up to bat for “The Cause”.
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/12/a-barrier-to-understanding/
Norman Page steps to the mound and blisters one in:
“what year would you reconsider the CO2 – Warming paradigm if the CRU Global annual mean temperature is cooler than 2005 – 2009…?”
Schmidt swings: 
“You need a greater than a decade non-trend that is significantly different from projections. [0.2 – 0.3 deg/decade]”
And it’s a miss! A decade +1 of essentially no trend (slight cooling):
http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/wti/from:2001/plot/wti/from:2001/trend
Strike 1.
http://www.realclimate.org/?comments_popup=2019Note
Page steps down to give John Henriksen a chance; He gives it all he’s got with this pitch:
“what would FALSIFY [linking CO2 to ‘warming’]?”
Schmidt swings again:
”that the stratosphere is not cooling as expected (this is a cleaner test than the surface temperatures because there are less extraneous factors)”
And it’s a miss! The stratosphere hasn’t been cooling in over a decade:
http://www.acd.ucar.edu/Research/Highlight/stratosphere.shtml

Strike 2.
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/09/how-much-will-sea-level-rise/comment-page-4/#comments
Richard Wakefield steps up and pitches:
”How many more years of no acceleration [in SLR] will it take to abandon AGW theory?”
Gavin swings:
“AGW is based on the radiative impact of CO2 and other atmospheric constituents – none of those things depend on sea level rise.”
Hit……..Foul Ball. Misdirection doesn’t answer the question. SLR is one of the claimed major impacts of AGW and often presented as evidence for GW. If sea level rise remains constant or drops I find it hard to believe that wouldn’t damage the AGW case among both laymen and impartial scientists considering how many times temperature increase has been connected to sea level rise and the “it’s accelerating” touted as proof it’s anthropogenic. Later in the same thread: “Do you have peer reviewed papers that shows that the cause of B (sea level rise) is because of AGW?” — Wakefield; ”Response: Yes. Domingues et al (2008). – gavin”. So, if SLR is caused by AGW and SLR stops where does that leave AGW? A cause without its signature effect? LOL.
http://www.realclimate.org/?comments_popup=6013
Now, Steve Shaw takes the mound, digs in, and throws a curve ball:
”To clarify what I am wrestling with, whether CO2 warms the planet isn’t the issue. The issue is whether we have enough information yet to say authoritatively that the next 40 years will be more like 1980-2000 than like 2000-2010, in the amount of increase. This is fundamental to determining appropriate public policy. ….. I just need some specific aspects pinned down.”
Schmidt doesn’t swing:
It’s in there, right through the strike zone into the catchers mitt: Obviously, this question is absolutely germane to the “debate”, if we can’t answer “yes”, and explain why in a Willis type elevator speech, then, what the heck is all the hullabaloo about? But instead of commenting with what should be an “easy” answer, this question is relegated to The Bore Hole (#383).
Strike 3; You’re OUT! 
Next up at bat its “The Mann” himself and “The Skeptics” are in disagreement over whether they really need to send a picture up to the mound. But we’ve run out of time ….. signing off.

I knew Jacinda Ardern and her CoL had plunged the country into a financial crisis when our local hospital this week announced that all its inpatient beds were full and the overflow had filled the A&E beds with emergency admissions. They have declared a “code red”. Because they have no money they have also cancelled all elective surgery, with the expected reduction in the quality of life for all those on the waiting lists: lists that had been thrown into chaos by the recent doctors’ strike.



Apparently, the waiting list was 3 to 4 months, but now that all elective surgery has been cancelled it could be anywhere from 6 months to 18 months. We are living in a first-world country, aren’t we?



Our PM has money to spray around the Pacific Islands, to fund the ill-conceived firearms buyback scheme (that incidentally won’t save a single life), but not to fund hospitals properly to save lives and reduce the suffering of those that pay her salary. The same people who also fund the cost of flying her to all her self-promoting overseas stage shows. We must also not forget the billions we give away to the Climate Scam, the UN, the Clinton Foundation and all the others.



As people on the BFD have pointed out, the health, wellbeing and prosperity of the citizens should and must come first, and this should be Jacinda’s only and main focus. Whatever happened to her “Wellbeing” budget? Our local hospital and I would like to know.

"Hormone-disrupting pollutants in the urban rivers of South Wales are having adverse effects on the health and development of wild birds such as dippers.  Research we’ve undertaken in collaboration with the Universities of Saskatchewan and Exeter, alongside staff from the Natural Environment Research Council, shows that the chicks of dippers feeding along urban rivers have depressed thyroid hormone activity – in the case of one thyroid hormone by almost 50%. Urban dippers hatch fewer female chicks than those nesting in rural rivers nearby, while urban chicks are also underweight by comparison with their rural counterparts. Dippers are thrush-sized river birds that feed exclusively on fish and insects, and they acquire pollutants through this river-sourced diet. Our earlier evidence had shown already that urban dippers lay eggs with significantly increased levels of pollutants – particularly PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and PBDE (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), which have been used as flame-retardant chemicals in textiles, building materials, plastics and vehicles. Indeed, the concentrations of PBDEs in the eggs of Wales’ urban dippers are among the highest ever detected in songbirds anywhere in the world. These elevated concentrations are enough to explain adverse effects on chick development. All in all, these are worrying signs that could have negative implications for the breeding and survival of dippers and potentially other wild birds and animals that use urban rivers as habitat. The use of plants and animals like dippers as indicators of environmental safety or quality is a long-standing idea. The most celebrated example is the canary – which in mining regions such as South Wales were once carried far underground to warn colliers of the presence of suffocating gases: if the bird stopped singing and fell from its perch, it was a bad sign for the men and children who also worked in the mines. Might it be possible that dippers are a modern-day example that is at least as good? Over the last 30 years, I’ve investigated how a range of environment changes has affected dippers and their biology. In the 1980s, it was possible to show how problems such as acid rain reduced the numbers of insects that dippers used as prey, leading to equally marked reductions in dipper numbers. Where there was a scarcity of calcium-rich prey (critical for egg-shell formation and found in fish, freshwater shrimps and snails), dippers laid lighter eggs with thinner shells. And, in rivers polluted by insecticide residues or PCBs from local agriculture or industry, concentrations of these chemicals accumulated in dipper eggs to reveal the most affected regions and river systems. In one case, contaminants in eggs even pinpointed a single pollution source from a scrapyard that had been missed by the local regulatory authority. The concept of dippers as river indicators has been picked up in other nations too. In Canada and North America, researchers such as my collaborator Christy Morrissey used eggs of the American dipper to reveal patterns in the pollution climate across whole continents. Canadian rivers, for example, were generally cleaner and lower in persistent pollutants than those in Europe. Morrissey and I also used dippers to reveal where migrating Pacific salmon “bio-transported” pollutants from the continental shelf into Pacific river systems. In Nepal and India, we’ve used another dipper species, the brown dipper, to investigate how agricultural intensification affected Himalayan river ecosystems through pollution, altered river habitats and reduced food abundance. Now, this story of dippers and their powerful value as indicator species has once more come home to Wales – and to very same mining areas where canaries were once taken underground. Only 30 years ago, the rivers of the South Wales coal field were grossly polluted by sewage and colliery discharges, and dippers were nowhere to be seen. As these and other urban rivers have been progressively cleaned-up, dippers have once again started to breed in numbers along these formerly polluted rivers. But our new findings show how this story has a twist in the tail. Although they’re breeding again along South Wales’ urban rivers, dippers once again appear to be telling us something. Despite cleaning up gross pollution, subtle toxic effects might well persist in the urban environment, as shown by the persistent pollutants present in dipper eggs and in the apparent effects on their chicks. As with the canaries of old, this is a warning that we should heed."
"**England could face a third wave of coronavirus if ministers do not ""get the balance right"" with restrictions, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says.**
He defended the move to a tiered approach when England's lockdown ends on Wednesday, saying the curbs are needed to ""bear down"" on the pandemic.
MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance.
The PM has told MPs the restrictions will expire on 3 February in a bid to stop a Commons rebellion.
In a letter to all MPs and peers, Boris Johnson said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January and the tier system could end in February.
But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said her party's support was ""not unconditional"" and they were seeking ""clarity"" about the tier system.
It comes as a further 12,155 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 1,617,327.
There have been another 215 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, the total under that measure now being 58,245.
England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
When asked whether there could be a third national lockdown, Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr the government was ""doing everything we can to avoid that"".
But he said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right"".
He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday the tiers would be downgraded in areas where the virus was in retreat, saying: ""We are starting with a more restrictive approach than previously with the localised approach.
""But that allows us to ease up when we are confident the virus is going down and stabilised - there's a review every two weeks.""
Asked whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said: ""The problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them.""
Labour's Ms Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr her party ""will act in the public interest"".
""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it,"" she said.
She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place.
Meanwhile, in a bid to answer MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end.
In his letter, Mr Johnson said:
In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines.
He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight.""
**By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News**
'Tis the season to be jolly careful, said Boris Johnson last week. And he needs to be, with a potential rebellion of his own MPs to worry about.
His letter to all MPs is a change of tone from yesterday when Michael Gove warned it wasn't just ministers who had to take difficult decisions, but MPs too.
This morning, the foreign secretary went for the more reassuring approach and piled on the domestic diplomacyâ¦.
""We are listening"", he said.
One Tory MP told me this morning that the letter was ""nice"" but he still hadn't decided how to vote.
Many Tory MPs are waiting for an impact assessment- looking at the economic, social and health effects of the tier system, due to be published on Monday.
So far, Labour haven't said they will support the measures, but they've never voted against Covid health restrictions in the past.
Writing in the Sunday Times, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he will vote against the restrictions on Tuesday.
He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier.
""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said.
Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on.
He tweeted that MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time.""
But writing in the Sunday Times, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone.""
She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"".
On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours."
"**A student house has been issued with a closure order for holding parties that breached coronavirus restrictions.**
Manchester City Council said action was taken after the house in Fallowfield ""persistently"" went against the rules.
This included a party with more than 70 guests in September despite the city being subject to enhanced measures to stop the spread of the virus.
Under the order imposed at Manchester Magistrates' Court, it is a criminal offence to have visitors to the house.
The ruling prevents anyone apart from the tenants, emergency services and parties acting for the landlord from entering the property for the next three months.
In September, people in Greater Manchester were banned from mixing with other households indoors or outdoors.
The council said 183 letters had been sent to student households alleged to have breached Covid restrictions and 16 visits had been made to properties where a second breach had been reported since September.
Police have also issued 185 fixed-penalty notices to students for breaches, a spokesman for the authority said.
Councillor Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of students have ""done the right thing in the face of incredibly difficult circumstances"".
""My sympathies are with students whose university experience has been impacted by Covid, however there is no excuse for the incredibly reckless behaviour we have seen in this situation,"" he said.
In September, students in Manchester were warned not to attend freshers' events and avoid big parties because of the pandemic.
About 1,700 Manchester Metropolitan University students then had to self-isolate after 127 tested positive for Covid-19.

"The global coal industry will “never recover” from the Covid-19 pandemic, industry observers predict, because the crisis has proved renewable energy is cheaper for consumers and a safer bet for investors. A long-term shift away from dirty fossil fuels has accelerated during the lockdown, bringing forward power plant closures in several countries and providing new evidence that humanity’s coal use may finally have peaked after more than 200 years.  That makes the worst-case climate scenarios less likely, because they are based on a continued expansion of coal for the rest of the century. Even before the pandemic, the industry was under pressure due to heightened climate activism, divestment campaigns and cheap alternatives. The lockdown has exposed its frailties even further, wiping billions from the market valuations of the world’s biggest coal miners. As demand for electricity has fallen, many utilities have cut back on coal first, because it is more expensive than gas, wind and solar. In the EU imports of coal for thermal power plants plunged by almost two-thirds in recent months to reach lows not seen in 30 years. The consequences have been felt around the world as well. This week, a new report by the US Energy Information Administration projected the US would produce more electricity this year from renewables than from coal for the first time. Industry analysts predict coal’s share of US electricity generation could fall to just 10% in five years, down from 50% a decade ago. Despite Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to “dig coal”, there are now more job losses and closures in the industry than at any time since Eisenhower’s presidency 60 years ago. Among the latest has been Great River Energy’s plan to shut down a 1.1-gigawatt thermal plant in North Dakota and replace it with wind and gas. Rob Jackson, the chair of Global Carbon Project, said the pandemic was likely to confirm that coal will never again reach the global peak seen in 2013: “Covid-19 will slash coal emissions so much this year that the industry will never recover, even with a continued build-out in India and elsewhere. The crash in natural gas prices, record-cheap solar and wind power, and climate and health concerns have undercut the industry permanently.” Records are falling thick and fast. By Friday, the UK national grid had not burned a single lump of coal for 35 days, the longest uninterrupted period since the start of the industrial revolution more than 230 years ago. In Portugal, the record coal-free run has extended almost two months, the campaign group Europe Beyond Coal recently reported. Last month Sweden closed its last coal-fired power plant, KVV6 in Hjorthagen, eastern Stockholm, two years early because the mild winter meant it was not used even before the pandemic. Austria followed suit with the shutdown of its only remaining coal plant at Mellach. The Netherlands said it would reduce the capacity of its thermal plants by 75% to comply with a court order to reduce climate risks. More importantly, in India – the world’s second-biggest coal consumer – the government has prioritised cheap solar energy rather than coal in response to a slump in electricity demand caused by Covid-19 and a weak economy. This has led to the first year-on-year fall in carbon emissions in four decades, exceptional air quality, and a growing public clamour for more renewables. Elsewhere in Asia, the picture is mixed. A few years ago, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines were expected to be the industry’s biggest growth areas, but the pandemic, falling renewable prices and a growing divestment campaign have put several major coal projects on hold. The party of South Korean president Moon Jae-in has been re-elected on a pledge to phase out domestic coal use, and many in his ruling coalition are pushing to end financing of overseas projects. In Japan, the big three commercial lenders and the governor of the Japan Bank of International Cooperation have recently said they will no longer accept proposals for coal generation. Other money taps are also being turned off, as investors and finance houses respond to scientific advice and campaigns by divestment activists and school strikers such as Greta Thunberg. “The economics of coal were already under structural pressure before the pandemic,” said Mark Lewis, the head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of French bank BNP Paribas. “And coming out of it these pressures will still be there – but now compounded by the impact of the pandemic.” BNP Paribas is one of a growing list of financial institutions which have chosen to sever ties with coal. The bank said last week that it would accelerate its planned exit from coal financing to 2030 to bring its portfolio in line with the Paris climate goals sooner. In the same week, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund – the world’s biggest – ditched a host of coal mining and energy companies, including Glencore, Anglo-American, Vale and AGL over climate concerns. This follows coal blacklisting announcements by BlackRock, Standard Chartered and JPMorgan Chase. The fossil fuel has fallen from favour in the eyes of many investors due to rising climate concerns, cheaper renewable energy alternatives and a public backlash against air pollution. “The public health benefits of cleaner air will be front and centre after weeks of lockdown that have prompted blue skies and clean air in Asia’s megalopolises,” Lewis said. “This pressure from the finance sector will only accelerate going forward, pushing the cost of capital for coal projects even higher.” Even before the pandemic, Australian coal companies said they were finding it hard to find financing for mines and port facilities due to the international divestment campaign. This is not the only economic squeeze. A near-30% fall in the price of thermal coal has made more than half of production unprofitable, prompting several firms to warn of pit closures and layoffs. The elephant in the room is China, which burns half of the world’s coal and is the biggest financier of mines and power plants in Asia and Africa – largely to provide an export market for its domestic manufacturing and engineering firms. A few years ago, domestic coal consumption fell, prompting hopes that president Xi Jinping was committed to a shift away from dirty, high-emitting power production. But after the lockdown, the political priority is to jumpstart the economy. Provincial governments are now working on a slew of new thermal plants. But they are running at less than half of capacity because demand for coal has not returned to its previous level. “Covid-19 has made clear that China and India have built more than they need. Even before the crisis, they had overcapacity. Now with lower demand, you can see everything is a mess,” said Carlos Fernández Alvarez, lead coal analyst at the International Energy Agency. Alvarez said coal had been hit hardest by the pandemic, but he cautioned the decline could be temporary unless governments invest in renewables to pull economies out of the lockdown. “We have to look at this structurally. If there is high energy demand again in the future, it will probably be coal that picks up the slack because it is the marginal supplier,” he said. While nobody is expecting coal to disappear any time soon, Ted Nace, director of Global Energy Monitor, believes the balance has shifted for good. “Coal is definitely on the downturn and this pandemic is going to accelerate that. Demand should come back to some degree next year. But there is a very strong argument that it is not going to just bounce back.” • This article was amended on 18 May 2020. The quote about “structural pressure” was from Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of BNP Paribas, not from Michael Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, as an earlier version said. And it was the party of the South Korean president that was re-elected this year, rather than Moon Jae-in himself."

This morning the Supreme Court issued its long awaited decision in the case of Jeffrey Skilling. The most important aspect of the case concerned the so‐​called “honest services” statute. That law has been an amorphous blob that federal prosecutors could suddenly invoke against almost anyone. All nine justices acknowledged the law had problems, but only three–Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy–said the law was unconstitutionally vague. The other six justices bent over backwards to “save” the law from invalidation–they ruled that the law should be narrowly interpreted. Here is, I think, the most telling passage from the majority’s ruling: 



“As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive **no significant risk** that the honest services statute, as we intrepret it today, will be stretched out of shape.”



Instead of strict rules and limits on government power, the Court is content to offer leeway to the prosecutors–some risk of arbitrary prosecutions is acceptable you see.   
  
  
The burden ought to be placed on the government–legislators and prosecutors ought **to be able to justify every single case**. Instead, this Court needs to be persuaded that a **significant risk** of abuse exists. Here is a passage from a Supreme Court case from years ago that gets it right: 



“A criminal statute cannot rest upon an uncertain foundation. The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue. Penal statutes prohibiting the doing of certain things, and providing a punishment for their violation, should not admit of such a double meaning that the citizen may act upon the one conception of its requirements and the courts upon another.”



The second issue in the case concerned Skilling’s right to an impartial jury trial. And it came as no surprise that the Court embraced a prosecutor‐​friendly view of the Sixth Amendment. Skilling argued that the climate in Houston following the collapse of Enron was so hostile that he should have been granted a change in venue. He’s right about that. The prosecution should be indifferent as to whether they present their incriminating evidence in Houston or another city. Instead, the Court shifts the burden to the accused and sniffs, “sorry, you have not clearly proven to us that you were prejudiced by biased jurors. If someone could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had a biased jury, well that would be another story.”   
  
  
Here’s a modest proposal: This summer each justice should represent some persons accused of crimes.   
  
  
For additional background, go here.

"**The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK.**
Universities are opening temporary testing centres where hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave.
Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart.
If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December.
But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities.
The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"".
Caleb Shaw, a journalism student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, is taking a test on Monday.
""I know I'm less likely to get seriously ill with it,"" he says, but he wants to get a test to protect his family.
""If I get a test then I can make sure I don't bring it home to them. It would be stupid to not take advantage of it,"" Caleb says.
The university is using its sports centre as a temporary testing site until 6 December with 90 staff and students helping with the testing process.
Inshaal Ahmad, a students' union sabbatical officer at the University of Bradford, says most students seem supportive of the testing.
He says many students at Bradford live in multi-generational households, including older relatives, and want to ""be on the safe side"" and not risk bringing the virus back from university.
Testing at Bradford will continue until 6 December and as with other universities, booking slots for tests will also be a way of staggering the times when students can leave, within the ""travel window"" that ends on 9 December.
The mass testing is intended to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus as students travel away from their term-time addresses.
Sports halls and rooms on campus are being converted into testing centres, where students will take ""lateral flow"" swab tests, which will provide results within an hour, with the outcome sent by email or text.
Two tests are recommended to increase accuracy - and students will be expected to travel soon after a second negative result, with students in England and Wales encouraged to leave within 24 hours.
If students get a positive result, they will have to take another test to confirm - and if they have coronavirus they will have to stay and self-isolate.
Most universities are providing testing - 130 ""expressed an interest"" in taking part in the scheme, according to the Department for Health and Social Care.
But the National Union of Students says there should be capacity for all students who want a test to get one before Christmas.
""We are not aware of how universities will decide which students are tested if testing is oversubscribed,"" says the NUS.
The UCU lecturers' union says the approach to testing has been rushed and confused and the last-minute arrangements will be a ""recipe for chaos"".
The union said it had ""grave concerns"" and ""testing so many people and following necessary safety measures would be an extremely challenging operation"".
But not all universities in Northern Ireland are planning to offer testing.
""Testing will help to break the line of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it,"" said Professor Steve West, vice chancellor at the University of the West of England.
Bradford's vice chancellor, Professor Shirley Congdon, told students the tests ""offer extra assurance to you, your families, friends and community"".â¨"
"**Peak rail fares should be suspended over Christmas and mass testing should be provided for transport workers to avoid travel ""chaos"" when restrictions ease, Labour has said.**
Three households in the UK will be able to form a ""bubble"" from 23-27 December.
A surge in travel is expected and Labour wants a ""comprehensive travel plan"" presented to Parliament.
Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy has been appointed to assess how prepared road and rail networks are.
The Department for Transport said on Friday that plans are being prepared to reduce disruption on roads and railways, including 500 miles of roadworks being cleared and extended train timetables.
Labour has warned that more than two million people travelled by train between Christmas and New Year in previous years, plus millions more by car.
It said suspended peak fares between 23 and 27 December would reduce the risk of overcrowding on trains either side of peak hours.
Train staff, bus drivers and highway personnel should also be mass tested, Labour said.
Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is too important for the government to ignore or leave until the last minute. This is about protecting lives and livelihoods.""
Labour also argued that planned engineering works on the East Coast Mainline - which will close London King's Cross station for six days from Christmas Day - should be delayed from 27 December.
And it said Highways England should postpone non-essential road maintenance to reduce congestion and travel delays.
Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021.
The Department for Transport said it will publish measures aimed at easing travel disruption next week, and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to plan their journeys ""very carefully"".
The start and the end of the five-day travel window is expected to be very busy.
Cheaper advance train tickets went on sale on Friday for Christmas travel, about eight weeks later than usual because of delays in finalising timetables during the pandemic.
To allow social distancing capacity on board trains is restricted and some operators are preventing passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket.
London North Eastern Railway, which normally uses London King's Cross station for its Anglo-Scottish trains, has warned that alternative routes will be ""very busy and should also be avoided""."

On Dec. 10, Randy Schekman, a UC Berkeley professor, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The day before, he published an op‐​ed in London’s Guardian, titled “How journals like Nature, Cell, and Science are damaging science,” in which he announced that he will henceforth refuse to send manuscripts for peer‐​reviewed consideration to these prestigious science journals.



Schekman’s accusation is that these journals are distorting science by being biased towards the “flashiest” research, i.e. papers that generate headlines such as “Global Warming Will Kill Billions, Scientist Finds,” rather than the best research.





Do science journals’ propensity for flashy research result in biased research?



This matters more than one might think, because governments and universities disproportionately make their award and funding decisions based on the research published in the prestige journals.



So, if Science and Nature differentially publish flashy research, and publishing there will deliver funding and tenure, scientists are naturally going to gravitate toward trendy topics and produce flashy research. It’s a cycle that perpetuates Armageddon‐​style headlines that compel politicians to disburse more money, for more research, ultimately buying a beach house for the doom‐​saying scientists.



This leads to the question: do the journals’ propensity for flashy research result in biased research?



Unfortunately, yes; especially when it comes to climate science.



Just take a look at Science’s “Perspectives” pieces, which are really opinion pieces posing as literature reviews. Despite the fact that global warming has been prominent for about 25 years now, Science has yet to publish one Perspectives piece summarizing the body of refereed science indicating that far too much warming may have been predicted.



That should not be the case, because every new forecast of climate change should have an equal probability of producing a more or less dire result. That’s what happens with weather forecast models as new information comes in. Once it has been established that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide should raise surface temperature a certain amount, each new piece of information should either raise or lower the forecast.



But scientists aren’t incentivized to look under the less‐​flashy rock. In fact, they threaten their own well‐​being if they do.



If scientists aren’t doing their due diligence, is Schekman right that the journals aren’t doing theirs either? It’s easy to find out. I reviewed 13 months of both Science and Nature, and sorted every article or story about climate change or its impact into three piles: worse, better, or neutral compared with previous studies.



Of the 115 entries, 23 made the “neutral” pile, 83 were in the “worse” stack, and nine were in the “better.” The probability of the journals not having a bias is as likely as a coin being flipped 92 times and showing heads or tails fewer than nine times.



The number is: 100,000,000,000,000,000.



You can look this up in a binomial probability table, which shows the average number of times you have to flip a coin 92 times to get this result.



The obvious “publication bias” by these two journals is very troubling, because the resultant public funding and tenure could have some pretty nasty consequences.



This creates horrific effects, especially when the issues are policy‐​related. Summaries of the scientific literature are used to guide policymakers, but if the published research is biased, then so must be the summaries; leaving policymakers no option — not being scientists themselves — but to embrace what is inevitably touted as “the best science.”



Recently, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its fifth “Scientific Assessment” of climate change, which is, in effect, a massive literature review. Since the most prestigious journals carry the most weight, the literature that is reviewed is itself biased. The result? Even the most accurate and comprehensive review must create a biased picture.



The result is very bad policy: cap‐​and‐​trade schemes, carbon taxes, and ugly windmill and solar arrays that produce little power but appeal to the politician’s need to “do something.” All ultimately driven by scientists behaving rationally, but badly.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel here presents the top 10 science stories of 2013.
Among them is the stop in global warming, which Spiegel describes as “the mysterious temperature development of the past years“. In the sub-heading Spiegel writes:
An unexpected development has been occupying the attention of climate scientists: The air appears not to have warmed up in the last 16 years. Obviously natural phenomena are covering the increasing impact of greenhouse gases.”
Here Spiegel appears to be very confused by the science, admitting that natural factors are running the show but at the same time illogically claiming that the impact of greenhouse gases is increasing! Spiegel then writes that skeptics should not be so sure that the warming has stopped, claiming that there’s “a variety of plausible explanations for the unexpected development“.
Spiegel then cites ocean cycles, weak solar activity, and both natural and manmade aerosols, which is amazing because except for aerosols, these are precisely the factors that skeptics have been claiming and alarmists dismissing from the get-go.
So whatever excuses or wordsmithing Spiegel tries to employ to save face from having been a grand believer of the AGW dogma since the very start, two things are clear: 1) the warming has definitely stopped, and 2) natural factors are really much more important than assumed and that the skeptics were right all along.
It’s time to completely revamp the models so that they start to resemble reality. It’s also time for the media to rethink their position on the issue rather than trying to hopelessly prop it up.

"**At least eight people have been killed and 52 injured after a prison riot in Sri Lanka which saw guards clash with inmates, officials have said.**
The inmates had launched protests amid a surge of coronavirus infections in the prisons, demanding early release on bail and better facilities.
Police spokesman Ajith Rohana said guards had ""used force to control an unruly situation"" in the Mahara prison.
Around 1,000 cases have been reported from the country's overcrowded prisons.
Media reports say prison guards had opened fire to contain the riot. Local news reports quoted residents who said they had seen a ""massive fire"" on the premises.
Deputy Inspector Ajith Rohana told BBC Sinhala that the injured had been admitted to the local Ragama hospital.
Mr Rohana added that a contingent of elite police commandos had been called to tighten security around the prison, and five police teams had also been deployed.
This is the latest in a series of prison riots that have taken place in Sri Lanka in recent weeks, as the number of Covid-19 cases in jails continues to increase.
In the capital Colombo, a group of protesters at Welikada jail launched a protest on the top of a prison roof asking that they be granted bail.
Another group of inmates at the Agunakolapalassa prison have been protesting for eight days, alleging that conditions in their prison have worsened.
Rights groups say some 26,000 people are housed across facilities that have a capacity of about 10,000.
Sri Lanka experienced a surge in virus cases last month when two clusters - one at a garment factory and another at a fish market - emerged last month.
According to Johns Hopkins University, there are now 23,484 cases in Sri Lanka with 116 deaths reported."

Direct, reliable observations of atmospheric conditions stretch as far back as the mid seventeenth century, with otherwise consistent records being punctuated by periodic updates in methods, practitioners, and observational equipment. To bridge these shifts in technique and technology, scientists develop reanalysis models designed to tie together diverse observations into a coherent picture of the system’s evolution. But, like all models or analytical techniques, reanalysis data sets can suffer from errors or biases. Identifying how the records produced by different reanalyses vary can be a difficult practice, but determining if a cluster of models consistently produces biased results can be even more difficult.
A number of reanalyses have recently been developed to track the rapidly changing Arctic atmosphere, and Serreze et al. compared them with one another and with the observational record. The authors focused on how the reanalyses represent the change in Arctic tropospheric water vapor from 1979 to 2010. They compared three of the most recent and complex reanalyses against meteorological measurements made using radiosondes at nine sites north of 70 degrees North. They find that the reanalyses consistently overestimate low-altitude temperatures and winter humidity. It is important to note that these positive biases caused the reanalyses to miss low-altitude wintertime temperature and humidity inversions identified by the radiosondes.

A finding shared by both reanalyses and radiosonde observations, however, is of an increasing availability of precipitable water in the low-altitude Arctic, which the authors suggest is associated with increasing air-sea surface temperatures, reduced sea ice extent, and other markers consistent with the polar amplification of global warming. Increasing Arctic humidity is a troubling result, as heightening atmospheric water vapor could further drive up regional temperatures.

Changes in tropospheric water vapor over the Arctic are examined for the period 1979 to 2010 using humidity and temperature data from nine high latitude radiosonde stations north of 70°N with nearly complete records, and from six atmospheric reanalyses, emphasizing the three most modern efforts, MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim. Based on comparisons with the radiosonde profiles, the reanalyses as a group have positive cold-season humidity and temperature biases below the 850 hPa level and consequently do not capture observed low-level humidity and temperature inversions. MERRA has the smallest biases. Trends in column-integrated (surface to 500 hPa) water vapor (precipitable water) computed using data from the radiosondes and from the three modern reanalyses at the radiosonde locations are mostly positive, but magnitudes and statistical significance vary widely between sites and seasons. Positive trends in precipitable water from MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim, largest in summer and early autumn, dominate the northern North Atlantic, including the Greenland, Norwegian and Barents seas, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and (on the Pacific side) the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. This pattern is linked to positive anomalies in air and sea surface temperature and negative anomalies in end-of-summer sea ice extent. Trends from ERA-Interim are weaker than those from either MERRA or CFSR. As assessed for polar cap averages (the region north of 70°N), MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim all show increasing surface-500 hPa precipitable over the analysis period encompassing most months, consistent with increases in 850 hPa air temperature and 850 hPa specific humidity. Data from all of the reanalyses point to strong interannual and decadal variability. The MERRA record in particular shows evidence of artifacts likely introduced by changes in assimilation data streams. A focus on the most recent decade (2001–2010) reveals large differences between the three reanalyses in the vertical structure of specific humidity and temperature anomalies.

Recent political tumult and the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency have driven anxious commentators to lament the collapse of a post‐​1945 “liberal world order.” Nostalgic for the institution building and multilateral moment of the early postwar era, they counsel Washington to restore a battered tradition, uphold economic and security commitments, and promote liberal values. On closer inspection, while it is true that the postwar world was more prosperous and peaceful than what came before, the claim that a unitary “liberal order” prevailed and defined international relations is both ahistorical and harmful. It is ahistorical because it is blind to the process of “ordering” the world and erases the memory of violence, coercion, and compromise that also marked postwar diplomatic history. It loses sight of the realities and limits of the exercise of power abroad, the multiplicity of orders that arose, and the conflicted and contradictory nature of liberalism itself. While liberalism and liberal projects existed, such “order” as existed rested on the imperial prerogatives of a superpower that attempted to impose order by stepping outside rules and accommodating illiberal forces. “Liberal order” also conflates intentions and outcomes: some of the most doctrinaire liberal projects produced illiberal results. This nostalgia is harmful because framing the world before Trump in absolute moral terms as a “liberal order” makes it harder to consider measures that are needed to adapt to change: the retrenchment of security commitments, the redistribution of burdens among allies, prudent war‐​avoidance, and the limitation of foreign policy ambitions. It also impedes the United States from performing an increasingly important task: to reappraise its grand strategy in order to bring its power and commitments into balance.



According to a view popular in Washington, D.C., and other capitals around the world, the United States used its power and idealism for more than 70 years to create a security and economic order that transformed the world. This world order was liberal because the United States was liberal. “Liberal” in this context means the pursuit of security both through the spread of liberty, in the form of free markets and democratic constitutions, and the rule of law, in the form of rule‐​based international institutions. Today, defenders of that order fear that President Trump and a set of regressive forces are laying waste to it. They claim the consequences are grave: we are witnessing the “end of the West as we know it,”1 the abandonment of “global leadership” by its “long‐​time champion,”2 and a “coming Dark Age.”3 _Foreign Affairs_ , the house organ of the foreign policy establishment, recently asked 32 experts whether the “liberal order is in peril.” Most agreed it is, with 26 respondents registering a confidence level of 7 out of 10.4 Alarmed by the political tumult of our time, nostalgists recall the post‐​1945 moment of institution building and benign internationalism and call for its reclamation.



They are, however, in the grip of a fiction. Liberalism and liberal projects abounded in the past 70 years. But the dream of a unitary, integrated global system organized around liberalism is ahistorical. In truth, the pre‐​Trump world was a more brutal and messy place than the nostalgia allows. To be sure, there was liberalism, and it did help define postwar international relations. Broadly speaking, the post‐​1945 period was, on many measures, more prosperous, less violent, and more collaborative than what came before. One defect of “liberal order” nostalgia is that it exaggerates these qualities and simply leaves out too many contrary historical realities. Other critics have already noted the gap between nostalgia and history and that the postwar world was never “whole.” At times the liberal order was neither very liberal nor very orderly. There may be “islands of liberal order, but they are floating in a sea of something quite different.”5



Not only do nostalgists get the history wrong, they fail to confront what “world ordering” actually entails. The main critique in this paper is that the fetish for “liberal order” has obscured what is involved in the process of “ordering” — or attempting to order — the globe. The United States, as the leading actor in the orthodox narrative, emerges as a power that created order through a benign internationalist vision, consensus building, and institution creating. But the successes and failures of that order also flowed from coercion, compromise, and rougher power politics. As the ordering superpower, the United States did not bind itself with the rules of the system. It upended, stretched, or broke liberal rules to shape a putatively liberal order. Appeals to the myth of a liberal Camelot flow from a deeper myth, of power politics without coercion and empire without imperialism.



This fuller narrative is also a story of tragic limits. The world was not so easily subjugated. Efforts to spread liberalism often contained the seeds of illiberalism. Multiple orders collided and met the limits of their reach and power. Efforts to create a liberal order ended up accommodating illiberalism. Liberalism itself proved to be a conflicted thing. At times, projects to advance it had unexpected results. As it happens, the pursuit of “liberal order” is not just an antidote to the current difficulties suffered by the international system but a source of them.



Ideas about “order” matter and have weighty policy implications. Just as material power enables or forecloses certain choices, ideas condition and constrain a country’s grand strategic decisions. Those who lament the fall of the “liberal order” are saying, in effect, that some ideas are illegitimate and should be off the table. They worry that “populism” and “isolationism” endanger traditional ideas that were once dominant, leading America to abandon its manifold commitments overseas, in turn driving the world into disorder. When they call for the reclamation of the old order, they also call for the perpetuation of American primacy. By contrast, this paper argues that the exaggerated notion of the “liberal order” and its imminent collapse is a myth of the foreign policy establishment and leads America to overstretch.



This analysis is divided into three parts. First, I examine the lamentations for a lost world, unpacking what such lamentations claim about how the world “was” before its dissolution allegedly began. Liberal order nostalgia performs two functions: by denying the violent coercion, resistance, and unintended consequences of “world ordering,” it sanitizes history into a morality tale and delegitimizes arguments for revision and retrenchment. The lamentations also give an alibi to American primacy, attributing its demise to forces external to it. By reducing the issue to one of inadequate political will, and by blaming either elites or the public at large for failing to keep the faith, “liberal order” lamentations dodge the painful question of how such an excellent order could produce unsustainable burdens, alienate its own citizenry, and provoke resistance.



In the second section, I demonstrate that “liberal order” rhetoric is ahistorical and therefore largely mythical. The claim that a single, internally consistent, and consensual order predominated for more than 70 years, with liberal projects producing liberal results, fares poorly when compared with the major patterns of international relations from 1945, in the spheres of both security and commerce. Conversely, the claim that American statecraft is now being turned upside down is hyperbolic, and blind to the quiet victories that orthodox U.S. grand strategy is winning under the Trump presidency. 



Lastly, I argue that “world order” nostalgia is harmful. There is a prudent case for retrenchment, and a diplomacy of deterrence, power sharing, and accommodation, through which the United States could pursue security in a multipolar world. For an overstretched superpower to address the imbalance of power and commitments, it will have to look beyond ritual incantations.



The prospect of major change in the international system is attracting a new wave of literature about “world order.” Recent crises and political revolts have prompted security experts on both sides of the Atlantic to announce the coming of end times. The rise of pernicious “isms” — economic protectionism, authoritarian nationalism, political tribalism, superpower unilateralism — has triggered these fears, along with the gauntlets being thrown down by revisionist powers threatening U.S. hegemony in the Persian Gulf, Eastern Europe, and Asia. In the United States, the focal point of this eschatology is the presidency of Donald Trump. After the election of an erratic, coarse demagogue to the nation’s highest office in November 2016, security experts lamented the passing of a postwar structure that civilized international life, presided over by a benign American hegemon.



What is being threatened? The objects of anxiety are a “liberal world order,” which allegedly held sway for 70 years, and even the end of “the West” itself. The life of this order is normally periodized from the end of World War II in 1945 to the recent past. As the storyline goes, the United States as benevolent hegemon designed and underwrote a “global, rules‐​based” economic and security order that transformed the world.6



After its chief competitor, the Soviet Union, collapsed in 1989–1991, it extended this strategy globally. Proponents of liberal order draw on the logic of hegemonic stability theory.7 According to that theory, one dominant state exercises such a preponderance of power that it lessens the insecurities that lead to arms races and spirals of alarm, enabling other states to ease their security competitions with neighbors and rivals, relax their arms programs, and focus on economic growth. More ambitiously, it not only reshapes institutions and markets but remakes the preferences of other states. To its admirers, this order, for all its imperfections, achieved unprecedented general peace and prosperity. It was based on a harmony of interests between the United States and the rest of the world. It made the world a single system or “whole,” as Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass claims.8 Revision of the order, and retreats by the hegemon, will lead to increased disorder.



On the campaign trail Donald Trump explicitly threatened the status quo. He denounced allies as delinquent and threatened to shred alliances, tolerate nuclear proliferation, re‐​erect tariff walls, and abandon international agreements. To security traditionalists who oppose Trump, his revisionist challenge accelerates the collapse of a “liberal order” under a transnational assault by authoritarian forces. In a state of shock, they seek orientation in an ahistorical myth about the world before this dark age. As Princeton’s Aaron Friedberg tweeted, “After WWII US built a system of democratic states, tied together by trade, institutions and common values — a liberal order. Now it needs to defend that order against the illiberal powers it tried to incorporate after the Cold War.”9 Historian Jeremy Suri charges that Trump is plunging the world into a great regression by “launching a direct attack on the liberal international order that really made America great.” The elements of this order include “a system of multilateral trade and alliances that we built to serve our interests and attract others to our way of life.” Suri explains:



Through the European Recovery Program (the Marshall Plan), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, among other institutions, the United States led a postwar capitalist system that raised global standards of living, defeated Soviet communism, and converted China to a market economy. Through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe and a web of alliances in Asia and the Middle East, the United States contained aggressive states, nurtured stable allies, and promoted democratic reforms when possible.10



This sunny “highlights package” offers a strangely bloodless retelling of history. It is a euphemistic rendering of the Cold War and the actual practice of anti‐​Soviet containment by the superpower and its proxies. The Bay of Pigs, napalm, East Timor, the shah of Iran, and the Contras fade into the background. That this pristine retelling should come from distinguished historians of American diplomacy like Friedberg and Suri suggests how seductive the vision of an earlier and better order has become. Trump, too, is complicit in this mythmaking. Like his opponents, he frames his own election in stark terms. Trump speaks of a dark prehistory of “globalism,” of open borders, predatory capitalism, futile wars, and general American victimhood, and a return to wholesome nationalism, industrial regeneration, civilizational rebirth, and, of course, making America “great.”11



What was the liberal order, as its defenders define it? If an “order” is a coming together of power with social purpose, a “world order” is an international design of institutions, norms, and patterned relationships that defines the global balance of power.12 Some commentators argue that for a viable world order to emerge in a time of turbulence, the United States may have to compromise. Amitav Acharya, Michael Mazarr, and Henry Kissinger seek to revive the concept of world order, but unlike those of other “world order” visionaries, their proposed designs are pluralistic and require the United States to temper its universalism for the sake of stability and negotiated coexistence in a polycentric world.13



By contrast, the liberal order is a missionary project that looks to extirpate rival orders and demands the perpetuation of American dominance. As an ideal type, the “liberal order” entails a copious number of norms and institutions, suggesting that good things go together. In accounts of the postwar liberal order, many or all of the following features appear, though with varying emphasis: the rule of law and the supremacy of “rules,” humanist globalism and humanitarian development, free trade, multilateral cooperation, the security provision of the United States (principally through its permanent alliances), and a commitment to liberal progress through the advocacy of democratic and market reforms. Its institutions span the United Nations, NATO, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (followed by the World Trade Organization), the IMF, and the World Bank. A commitment to protocols and the bridging of divides figure centrally. Hence phrases like “open, rule‐​based international economy” abound.14 The “order,” proponents argue, embodied also a pattern of behavior, or, as Jake Sullivan at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace explains, a “system of norms, institutions, and partnerships” whereby, under the hegemon’s stewardship, collective cooperation trumped competition for relative advantage, significant shares of sovereignty were ceded for the benefits of collective action, and a global consensus spread.15 An “illiberal order” would presumably be the opposite of these things: politically and economically divided and closed, authoritarian, uncooperative, coercive, and disrespectful of rules and norms.



The liberal order is necessarily hierarchical. To speak of liberal order is to speak also of American primacy, with the former depending on the exercise of the latter. Nostalgists do not deny that the American superpower upheld it partly through overwhelming military strength. However, they emphasize the nonbloody uses of force, for example, deterring and dissuading adversaries, reassuring and uniting allies, and preventing conflict. And they stress the consensual, attractive quality of American hegemony. Postwar continental Europe therefore stands out as a favorite area of emphasis, as an “empire by invitation.”16



Most anxious observers agree that a significant “fall” is occurring.17 To explain it, they weigh heavily an alleged loss of political will within the West. Leading theorists of liberal order, such as Princeton’s G. John Ikenberry, have long warned that “the hallmarks of liberal internationalism — openness and rule‐​based relations enshrined in institutions such as the United Nations and norms such as multilateralism — could give way to a more contested and fragmented system of blocs, spheres of influence, mercantilist networks, and regional rivalries.”18 Once optimistic that the order would withstand geopolitical challenges and prove resilient, Ikenberry now fears a different kind of insurgent threat, flowing not from hostile subversive states but from within. Working‐ and middle‐​class populations, he suggests, may lose faith in the order as democracy degenerates.19



Similar complaints have arisen across the Atlantic. Warnings against U.S. disengagement are a staple of rhetoric from security thinkers in allied countries.20 For Robin Niblett, director of the internationalist Chatham House, Trump replicates and feeds on the destructive forces that powered “Brexit,” forcing liberalism into retreat.21 For the University of Exeter’s Doug Stokes, as for Ikenberry and Niblett, domestic discontent may unravel the worldwide arrangements that best served America’s “globalized” interests. For the old order to reproduce itself, it must make a new settlement with the American working class.22



Most of these diagnoses have a common premise. All offer an upbeat, potted history of the world created in and after 1945. Many then blame the crumbling of that world on agents or forces that are separate from it.23 If the order is perishing, they argue, it is being assassinated rather than dying from its internal failures. They have little to say about the significant reverses that occurred while the order reigned. These included some of America’s most disastrous wars, geopolitical chaos in the Persian Gulf from the Iran‐​Iraq War to the present sectarian breakdown, resurgent jihadi Islamism, the greatest act of urban terrorism committed by a nonstate actor in history, the eurozone crisis, the economic regression of Russia under “shock therapy,” mounting and unsustainable debt, the global financial crisis, the entrenchment and immobility of wealth, and the growing underclass of working poor. Rather than attributing to the old order the failures that occurred on its watch, nostalgists blame mismanagement, or popular fatigue, or “populism” and demagogues that whipped up mass discontent. They give credit to the order and U.S. primacy for benign developments, discounting other possible contributors such as the deterrent effects of nuclear weapons or the memory of World War II. That the order may have been complicit in its own undoing is hardly considered.



Nostalgia for a lost order is not just the complaint of self‐​styled liberal internationalists of any particular faction. It has a wider provenance among those who believe today’s choice lies between continuing American primacy and chaos. The strength of the consensus is reflected in a Brookings Institution paper, coauthored by former high‐​ranking officials in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, urging the White House to revert to a traditional posture, upholding an order favoring openness, human rights, and peace, and claiming that this is the only viable grand strategy for the United States.24 The hawkish intellectual Robert Kagan argues that the order established after World War II was a “liberal enlightenment project” that is now “challenged by forces from within and without,” not only because of popular fatigue with the burdens of international leadership but because Americans have forgotten the reasons their country adopted the role as the world’s guarantor and stabilizer.25 Primacists such as Robert Lieber, Thomas Wright, and Eliot Cohen issue similar warnings.26



The prominence of neoconservatives among this chorus is ironic. Critics once accused neoconservatives of violating the principles of liberal order with their bellicose unilateralism, by agitating for preventive war in Iraq in March 2003 without an explicit UN mandate, and by justifying torture. But this reflects the paradoxical problem at the heart of liberal “world ordering.” On the one hand, under most popular visions of liberal order, the hegemon creates a world based on deference to institutions and rules. But actual international life includes hostile, noncooperative forces that refuse to defer. Thus the liberal order includes conflicting rather than complementary rules and principles. It contains “veto players” like Russia or China with different conceptions of order. The protection and enforcement of such an order, and the enforcer’s own preponderance, rests upon selection and the exercise of a hegemon’s privilege.



Liberal world orders typically involve several impulses, namely, internationalism, integration, and imperialism.27 That last, imperialism, is the most contentious. Historically, world orders, with their trading protocols and monetary regimes, and control of sea lanes, commercial routes, and access to raw materials, are designed and imposed by the strong. The opening of Asian markets, a celebrated feature of liberal order, was also a pre‐​1945 byproduct of violent and imperial coercion, imposed on China by Great Britain through the Opium Wars and on Japan by American Commodore Matthew Perry with the threat of naval bombardment in 1853–1854.



Proponents of liberal order occasionally admit that what is sometimes framed straightforwardly as a rule‐​bound order is in fact a system of imperial power (and vigilante privilege) exercised by a hegemon. Robert Cooper, the former diplomat and adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair, argued that if the world had a civilized core that deserved lawful conduct, there was also a barbarous periphery that warranted “rougher methods of an earlier era.”28 “Among themselves,” he wrote, “the postmodern states operate on the basis of laws and open co‐​operative security” but “in the jungle, one must use the laws of the jungle.”29 One‐​time advocate of American empire Michael Ignatieff admitted that being an imperial power “means enforcing such order as there is in the world and doing so in the American interest. It means laying down the rules America wants (on everything from markets to weapons of mass destruction) while exempting itself from other rules (the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and the International Criminal Court) that go against its interest.”30 At the height of the war on terror, jurists advising the George W. Bush administration used a similar logic to justify the suspension of the rule of law and Geneva conventions.31 One can defend these inconsistencies as necessary, or not. That they continually recur suggests that liberal “world ordering” is an inescapably compromised process.



The United States is an imperial power, even if it is distinct from former empires. It may lack the land hunger of empires past and look different from European or Asian imperialisms. It was averse to formal annexation, refused to claim the mantle of empire, and made a succession of retreats, from Vietnam, Lebanon, and Iraq. But it still throws its weight around in imperial ways: through coercion, subversion, or patronage, it penetrates the sovereign autonomy of other states to constrain their choices. The political economy underlying American interventions was at times coercive, as in the structural‐​adjustment programs visited on developing countries from Eastern Europe to Latin America. Leading primacists who speak up for liberal world ordering have earlier acknowledged that the American project overseas must be necessarily imperial, albeit in this case of a distinctively informal “American” kind, involving the forceful suppression of revolt, hard‐​nosed enforcement of parameters around other states’ policies, and the exercise of unequal bargaining influence.32 But for the most part, today’s lamentations for a dying liberal order do not acknowledge the necessarily imperial component. This is the imperialism that does not know itself.



Invocations of the liberal world order have become the ritualized language of the foreign policy establishment. In the academy, there is a well‐​established scholarly study of “world orders.”33 But too often, especially among think‐​tank specialists and the foreign policy commentariat, the liberal order’s admirers assert what they ought to prove. In that respect, President Trump’s former deputy assistant for strategic communications at the National Security Council, Michael Anton, was right to argue that the foreign policy establishment has become a “priesthood,” fonder of recapitulation than argumentation.34 It repeats its axioms but neglects to ground its vision in a careful reading of history or the present. A good example is an article by Edward Luce in June 2017, mourning the internal defeat of Western liberalism and a new world “disorder.” To demonstrate the imminence of disorder under Trump, Luce did not examine what Trump was actually doing beyond the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which is not an unprecedented pullback. The many Trump administration moves that have affronted Moscow go unmentioned: for example, the reinforcement of NATO through increased funding of the European Reassurance Initiative; and the bombing of the Assad regime, Putin’s ally, in April 2017. Instead, Luce cited the statements of two allies who were wondering where Trump’s behavior would lead, gossip about personality clashes in Trump’s court, and corroborating statements from other figures in the foreign policy establishment who take the “liberal order” as an article of faith, betraying a confirmation bias. Without evidence, he then accused President Obama of “global retrenchment.”35 Typical of the genre, Luce contrasted these recent failures with the postwar internationalism and institution building of President Harry Truman.



To be reprimanded for violating established norms of American “global leadership,” against the exalted standards of Truman, is an occupational burden that comes with the presidency. Before Trump, critics had accused presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama of retreating from a long‐​standing commitment to a liberal world order. The charge that Washington is abandoning a noble Trumanite diplomatic past is less an observation than a political predisposition, substantively shallow yet part of the framework within which debate is conducted. International history after 1945 is more fraught.



Accusations that U.S. presidents are flouting a long‐​standing postwar liberal order rely upon a mythologized account of history. When presidents wage war unilaterally, topple governments, coerce allies, threaten abandonment, disregard the demands of international institutions, practice economic protectionism, or cultivate illiberal allies and clients, they may or may not be practicing prudent statecraft. Either way, their behavior is unexceptional. They are not departing from tradition.



Let us revisit history first in the area of trade and political economy. President Trump disturbs defenders of the liberal order partly through his economic nationalism, his promise to rebuild American manufacturing industries by erecting protective tariff walls, and his withdrawal from the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP). The extent to which U.S. membership in the TPP represented a long‐​standing commitment to liberal order is doubtful, given that the United States signed the agreement in February 2016 and withdrew in January 2017, and given that the agreement’s intent was to exclude and contain China as much as to integrate other Asian economies. Nonetheless, nostalgists assert that Washington’s commitment to free trade was a central pillar of liberal order. Identifying the marketing precepts of the Washington consensus with liberal order, they present Washington’s various “Open Door” policies as both a cause and symptom of the world’s liberalization.



Without question, the United States in the postwar period dismantled the economic architecture of the British Empire. It strove to reshape the international economic environment on its terms, to establish and exploit the dollar as the reserve currency, to promote open markets, and to make a world safe for the penetration of American capital. How far did that process, that long‐​standing commitment to the “Open Door,” represent a liberal drive for free trade?



In reality, there was not one but several postwar economic orders. As Michael Lind cautions:



Globalization on a large scale, characterized by the emergence of transnational corporations and supply chains, got underway only in the 1990s and 2000s. Mass immigration to the United States and Europe is also largely a post–Cold War phenomenon. The euro and the Eurozone date back only to 1999. Labor mobility within Europe is also a relatively recent policy. Controversial “megaregional” trade pacts like NAFTA, the TPP, and TTIP [Trans‐​Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership], which go beyond old‐​fashioned tariff reductions to rewrite much domestic legislation, go back only to the 1990s.36



Niall Ferguson, too, observes that “truly free trade, truly free capital flows and large‐​scale migration across borders did not begin until the 1990s.”37 Earlier decades saw capital controls, fixed exchange rates, and periodic returns to tariff barriers. One major pillar of the postwar order was U.S. ally, democratic Japan. Under U.S. military protection, that same country instituted, in the words of Claremont McKenna College’s Leon Hollerman, “the most restrictive foreign trade and foreign‐​exchange control system ever devised by a major free nation.”38 The long‐​running competition with the Soviet Union moved the United States to deliberately encourage the economic growth of its Asian allies, but under the shield of a neomercantilist state. In other words, in identifying the U.S.-led order with market and trade liberalization, nostalgists historicize what are in fact a quite recent set of post‐​1989 international arrangements. From this perspective, a liberal order did arrive, only it came later, in the age of post‐​1989 unipolarity.



There is a more basic defect in recollections of the liberal order. During the postwar era, the United States persistently flouted liberal economic principles and imposed restrictive measures when it suited. Indeed, major powers have not historically risen through free trade and passive governments. Ascending powers have typically risen partly through the deliberate, visible, and intervening hand of an activist state.39 So too with America. All U.S. presidents have had to manage the tension between the commitment to the “Open Door” and the demand for industrial protection at home. The subsidy, the tariff, the quota, and the bilateral voluntary‐​restriction agreement have remained part of America’s repertoire. As a recent study of global data by Gowling WLG reveals, the United States is a “long‐​term and prolific proponent of protectionist policies,” and the world order it presides over is notably protectionist.40 Since the 2008 financial crisis, the United States has imposed tariffs worth $39 billion, while the world’s top 60 economies have adopted more than 7,000 protectionist trade measures worth more than $400 billion. The United States and the European Union both accounted for the highest number of protectionist measures, each exercising more than 1,000, with India a distant third at 400.41 America’s trade protectionism has the highest impact on other countries. Foreign farmers would be baffled by the claim that the old order embodied free trade, when the United States persistently granted agricultural subsidies and other mechanisms limiting foreign governments’ access to U.S. consumers.42



The reversion to protectionism has precedents from before the global financial crisis. Some of the most strident advocates of open markets and the dismantling of trade barriers have in practice done the opposite. One was President Ronald Reagan. Reagan had championed the cause of free trade as a foundation of progress and peace. Yet as president, he increased the proportion of imports subject to restrictions by 100 percent from 1980, as well as tightened quotas, introduced “voluntary restraint agreements” and new duties, raised tariffs, and strengthened the Export‐​Import Bank in order to protect the recovery of U.S. industries, especially automotive, computer‐​chip, and steel.43 Reagan justified these steps on the grounds that he was forcing economic competitors to trade freely. Regardless, his policies were a long way from Adam Smith.



President Clinton also championed free trade, in words and deeds. He drove through NAFTA, a free trade zone uniting North America’s three largest economies, and pushed for China’s admission to the WTO under “most favored nation” status. Yet under Clinton, rice subsidies that continued during his administration enabled U.S. growers to dump their product onto the markets of vulnerable rural countries such as Haiti, Ghana, and Indonesia at depressed prices. Clinton has since apologized to Haiti for the devastation that these arrangements inflicted on the country.44



President George W. Bush emulated Reagan rhetorically, invoking the principles of free trade and unfettered markets. Yet in 2002, he increased steel tariffs by 30 percent, only to back down 20 months later under threat of punitive countertariffs by the European Union, a protectionist bloc in its relations with many countries beyond its borders. Confronted with the prospect of economic meltdown in the crisis of 2008, Bush intervened in the market with strongly protectionist measures, including bailouts of major firms, claiming, “I have abandoned free‐​market principles to save the free‐​market system.”45 The reintroduction of protectionist measures today, then, is not such a sudden or radical departure as is sometimes claimed, though Trump’s open enthusiasm for a “trade war” does mark a difference. There is a defensible logic to the position that in order to practice free trade a country needs a viable economy to practice it with. Reagan and Bush’s contortions on the issue reflect the inherent difficulty of liberal projects, whose architects often feel impelled to compromise with illiberal pressures. A world where even the most avowed exponents of free trade continually resorted to protectionism, though arguably more free and liberal than what had gone before or than what might have prevailed otherwise, was still not the “flat” free‐​market capitalist world we are being invited to be nostalgic for.



Nostalgists claim that one dividend of American hegemony has been the economic liberalization of the globe, or large parts of it. They could point, for example, to the transformation of China into a wealthy capitalist economy that has lifted its population out of “a dollar a day” poverty. But this liberalizing process is more conflicted than potted histories suggest. Beijing achieved rapid industrial revolution and the movement of its workforce from the field into the factory through authoritarian and illiberal measures: involuntary‐​resettlement urbanization schemes, population control through forced abortion and compulsory sterilization, severe working conditions, repression of civil society, including trade unions, labor, and human‐​rights activists, and internet surveillance, among other measures. The People’s Republic has consistently ranked low on the Freedom Index.46



A more direct application of U.S.-backed liberalism happened in Russia. After communist rule collapsed in 1991, at the urging and advice of the United States’ government and economists, Moscow embarked on a program of “shock therapy” to restructure Russia around the principle of market exchange, adopting accelerated privatization of state industries, deregulation, fiscal discipline, and the shedding of price controls. This experiment was a major effort in the project to enlarge the global liberal order at a rapid clip. It had the support of the leading institutions of global capitalism, the IMF, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department. Harvard academic Jeffrey Sachs, one of Russian liberalization’s architects from 1991 to 1993, set out the program’s logic in _The_ _Economist_ , a journal that champions the cause of the liberal world order. “To clean up the shambles left by communist mismanagement, Eastern Europe must take a swift, dramatic leap to private ownership and a market system. West Europeans must help it do so.”47 “Swift, dramatic leap,” a vast program grounded in classical liberal economics, took on the tempo and zeal of the revolutionary communism it aimed to replace. These rapid reforms replaced an oppressive and failed communist system. They did so at Washington’s continual insistence that Russia reform itself on “our conditions.” But the results on many measures were disastrous: capital flight and deep recession; slumping industrial production; malnutrition; the rise of criminality — a criminalized economy, in fact — intertwined with a corrupt oligarchy enjoying a concentration of wealth; and the decline of health care and an increased rate of premature deaths.48 As Nobel laureate and former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz observed, by eschewing the more gradualist path of Poland or China, the consequences of the program were profoundly illiberal.49 “Liberal order” visionaries are quick to give their ideas credit for the prosperity of nations from Western Europe to the Pacific Rim, finding causation in correlation. They deny such a direct link between their ideas and the problems of post‐​Soviet Russia.50 Yet it is hard to accept that measures like sudden privatization and the rise of monopolies in a corrupt country were not related to asset stripping and capital flight or that “eliminating the housing and utilities subsidies that sustained tens of millions of impoverished families” did not play a major part in the social ruin that followed.51 Western technocrats, diplomats, and politicians were deeply implicated in the new order’s design. 



Lamentations for the end of the liberal order are also heard in the realm of “hard” security. The U.S. hegemon, nostalgists warn, is losing (or has lost) the political will to underwrite the international system through a commitment to permanent alliances and to intervene to bring order out of chaos. Part of the current intellectual confusion flows from the conflation of liberalism, which is supposedly peaceable, consensual, and benign, with the process of “world ordering.” It is here that defenders of the old order present their most misleadingly anodyne account of history. A review of the actual experience of the past 70 years suggests that the process of “world ordering” must at times be coercive. For all the attractions of American hegemony abroad, there has also been resistance and imposition.



To understand how the superpower met that resistance and imposed itself, we must go beyond the romanticized postwar moment of Trumanite internationalism in the late 1940s. Consider both ends of the chronology as it is usually presented, from 1945 until the recent past. Admirers trace the restructuring of international life in that first year to the visionary institution building that President Truman oversaw amid World War II, such as the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco and its main creation, the UN Charter. In this rendering, the founders conceived the liberal order through a collaborative process of institution building. The narrative is strikingly nonviolent.



In fact, to create the conditions for that visionary world making, the liberal order was conceived in blood. Only months later, the same U.S. president launched two atomic strikes on Imperial Japan, immolating and irradiating two of its cities after blockade, firebombing, and starvation had not broken its will. He did so to put down an adversary that had been brutally pursuing a rival vision for an Asian order of its own. In order to create an order, Washington swept aside a competitor by introducing a genocidal weapon into the world. There are powerful arguments that this was the “least bad” choice available.52 Tellingly, though, in panegyrics for a dying liberalism, the words “Hiroshima” and “Nagasaki” hardly appear.



If there were liberal principles that underpinned the UN as it was founded in 1945, they were at first self‐​determination and sovereignty rather than democracy and human rights. The world order was hardly born “liberal” in the sense implied today: recall that two of the permanent five members of the UN Security Council were totalitarian communist states, and two of the democracies were managing colonial empires that they would not relinquish for decades. Then and now, modern liberalism is antithetical to the grave exertion of state power still practiced in 58 countries, the death penalty. To be sure, the birth of the post‐​1945 world order did advance some liberal ideas broadly. The general norm against imperial aggression was one. This, however, was not strong enough to prevent or dislodge China’s seizure of Tibet, the bids of Turkey and Greece to grab Cyprus, Israel’s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, India’s occupation of Kashmir and annexation of Goa, Indonesia’s occupation of East Timor, or indeed the Soviet Union’s occupation of Eastern Europe.



At the other end of the chronology, the present moment, consider that the U.S. hegemon has been waging a “war on terror” against Islamist jihadi groups since the 9/11 attacks of 2001. In pursuing the liberal cause of democratization as an antidote to terror, Washington entered the age of “enhanced interrogation” and preventive war. Now, with new weapons (drones) at hand, Washington conducts a sustained campaign of extrajudicial assassinations, often without the consent of host countries and without seeking formal permission or mandates. It has conducted renditions of suspected terrorists without trial. Reluctant to deal with live captives in indefinite detention, a more liberal president from 2009 increasingly avoided the dilemma by killing them. Meanwhile, whatever benefits it has wrought, American unipolarity was not peaceful or liberalizing for the unipolar power. The first two decades of the unipolar _Pax Americana_ after 1989, which made up less than 10 percent of America’s history, generated 25 percent of the nation’s total time at war. That period is more bellicose by an order of magnitude than the preceding eras of bipolarity and multipolarity, in terms of frequency if not intensity.53 Whether in Iraq and Libya, or now with U.S. assistance to Saudi Arabia’s indiscriminate bombardment of Yemen, this proclivity to continuous war making has not created a “liberal” condition of peaceful order. At home, there is a continuous state of alarm and vigilance, whereby “normality” is permanently suspended by an unending state of exception. This, combined with an encouraged state of paternalism where citizens are encouraged to be passive consumers of events, has helped weaken the checks and balances of the republican Constitution.54 Detention without trial, secret, warrantless surveillance, unauthorized wars, torture, covert “black sites” — these are not the obvious features of a robust liberal constitutional order. If large parts of the world have not accepted liberalism in major areas of civic life, neither has the United States.



Instead of a full reckoning with diplomatic history, nostalgists frame history around the positive creation of new architectures and schemes. Thus the Marshall Plan (1948–1961) figures centrally in America’s postwar historic mission, based on, as Benn Steil puts it, “the moral primacy of democratic government and free economic exchange.”55 This absolute, almost platonic account of the past has little room for other, less‐​celebrated events from the same era, such as the British‐ and U.S.-backed overthrow of Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953, deposed despite his commitment to national independence and secular democracy. In this picture, the violence and compromises of hegemony, moral and strategic, almost vanish.



Nostalgia for the liberal order also overlooks the reality that it was enforced through coercion. In the same era, a defining episode in the postwar assertion of American hegemony was the Suez crisis of 1956. In that hinge event of the Anglo‐​American relationship, the U.S. Sixth Fleet stalked and harassed British ships in the Mediterranean, fouling their radar and sonar, menacing them with aircraft and lighting them up at night with searchlights.56 With the British pound and oil supplies under pressure, President Dwight Eisenhower threatened Britain with the simple formula of “no ceasefire: no loans.” Patronage could be rapidly withdrawn, regardless of recent history, blood ties, or shared visions of Western‐​enforced order. The United States enforced its interpretation of that order by targeting its ally’s vitals.57



Between those two moments in time, the United States practiced geopolitics ruthlessly. It partly did so in the course of its long security competition with the Soviet Union. Strikingly, the Cold War as it was actually conducted and lived — where two superpowers did not allow rules, sovereignty, multilateralism, and institutions to constrain them when the stakes were high — does not occupy a prominent place in the mytho‐​history. Hardly anywhere in nostalgic reminiscences do there appear the numerous coups that were sponsored or supported by Washington. These interventions linked to the United States since 1945 may or may not have been defensible. They certainly violated one of the claimed core principles of “liberal,” “rules‐​based” order, that of self‐​determination.



The United States not only overthrew governments (sometimes democratically elected ones) — or attempted to — in Albania, Ghana, Guatemala, Greece, Cuba, Chile, Iran, El Salvador, Nicaragua, South Vietnam, Argentina, and Grenada. It also supported violently illiberal forces, from Islamist mujahideen in Afghanistan‐​Pakistan and President Hosni Mubarak’s oppressive state in Egypt to the Indonesian Suharto regime and its death squads. A mainstay of U.S. hegemony in the Persian Gulf is its partnership with Saudi Arabia, an absolutist state that beheads apostates and survives by making concessions to Wahhabi theocrats. It is currently waging a brutal campaign against rebels in Yemen that, according to Amnesty International, includes attacks that are “indiscriminate, disproportionate or directed against civilians and civilian objects, including funeral gatherings, schools, markets, residential areas and civilian boats.”58 NATO allies on the European continent for decades included authoritarian Portugal and Greece. West Germany, the poster child of the liberal order, did not have elections during its first four years, and its proud social democracy retained officials who had been security elites in the Third Reich.59 Former Nazi mandarins stuffed the highest levels of government, including the Foreign Office and the Interior and Justice Ministries. Several former Nazi generals would later become senior commanders in the Bundeswehr. And in the 1948 Italian elections, the CIA helped ensure the electoral defeat of communists by funding anti‐​communist parties, forging documents to discredit the Communist Party, and warning Italians that if they publicly supported the party they would be barred from entering the United States. For the sake of liberalism in the long term, the United States exercised its privileges. If the deliberate subversion of a democratic election abroad with “fake news,” bribes, and coercion represents the antithesis of liberal world order, as Trump’s critics now suggest, then Washington attacked that order in the period of its creation. Coups, partisan electoral interventions, the cooptation of illiberal actors, and the flouting of international law made American hegemony unexceptional.



In dismantling the power of old European colonial empires, the United States erected a form of domination that had an imperial quality of its own. Consider one of its more ambitious ventures in liberal ordering: the invasion and remaking of Iraq. The occupiers of Iraq regarded themselves as liberators. After invasion, though, the United States also projected power over Iraq’s interior governance in imperial fashion and with a liberal program, with all the tensions this implies. Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority Paul Bremer applied a program of rapid liberalization not only through the well‐​known de-Ba’athification and disbanding of the Iraqi Army, but through the order for “the full privatization of public enterprises, full ownership rights by foreign firms of Iraqi businesses, full repatriation of foreign profits … the opening of Iraq’s banks to foreign control, national treatment for foreign companies and … the elimination of nearly all trade barriers.”60 The United States continued to impose itself on Iraqi politics when it wanted, demanding and receiving the resignation of elected prime minister Ibrahim al‐​Jaafari in May 2007. Intended to implant market democracy, these measures infringed the country’s sovereign democratic will. In other words, the liberators were freeing the Iraqis to conform with the occupier’s preferences.



It remains hard to have an empire without imperialism. Yet many visions of liberal order erase the historical process of imperialism, decentering, as Jeanne Morefield argues, “imperial violence while simultaneously positing the necessity of imperial action.”61 If liberalism at a basic level is an enlightenment project committed to liberty, equality, and limitations on state power, and if “world ordering” requires imperialist power projection, it is hard to fuse them without friction. Some may conclude from this historical record that, in the history of American hegemonic “world ordering,” liberalism was missing in action. On each occasion, critics have accused the United States of betraying its own liberal traditions in the pursuit of power. But it is hard to believe that a republic whose leaders so often and so intensely enunciate liberal principles is really driven by secret, amoral cynicism. A more troubling possibility should be considered. Liberalism is a powerful engine of American statecraft, but that statecraft often violates liberal principles. As a dogma of foreign policy, liberalism is jealous, intolerant, and messianic. Applied unchecked, it leads to its own illiberal opposite.62 The practitioners of rough geopolitics were not necessarily hypocrites. They often believed they were serving the ultimate cause of forging a liberal peace under American oversight but that to do so they had to accommodate illiberal allies and pitilessly destroy liberalism’s enemies. In this way, a superpower attempting to create a liberal order permits itself to employ unsentimental methods.



Thus in February 2017, David Petraeus could recall sincerely that “to protect freedom here at home, we adopted a foreign policy that sought to protect and, where possible, promote freedom abroad, along with human rights and rule of law,” invoking American values such as “political pluralism” and “a free and open society.”63 Yet as commander in Iraq, Petraeus sought to reverse that country’s implosion and salvage victory by compromising these standards. To that fight, he brought pragmatic, byzantine divide‐​and‐​exploit methods, paying for the defection of former Iraqi insurgents and working with Shia paramilitary units not known for their commitment to the Hague conventions. As director of the CIA, Petraeus advocated and implemented a campaign of “signature” drone strikes, whereby the assailant knowingly targets a group gathering — at a funeral for an al Qaeda member, for instance — because of their suspicious behavior and association, rather than through verified identification of the presence of individual persons. Such strikes, therefore, can also threaten noncombatants and the innocent.64 To bolster the struggling rebellion in Syria, Petraeus later in 2015 advocated luring away and recruiting “opportunistic” members of the jihadist Jabhat al‐​Nusra, then formally affiliated with al Qaeda.65 This is not the place to arbitrate the wisdom and legitimacy of such measures. Dealing with conflicts in such places is a choice of agonies, and no doubt Petraeus and his peers regard themselves as guarding Americans while they sleep and trafficking with lesser evils to keep greater ones at bay. But note that a senior advocate of liberal order can also advocate measures that risk “crowd killing” and that involve enlistment of members of jihadi terrorist organizations and collaboration with sectarian governments. Champions of liberalism must somehow navigate their ideals through the illiberal demands of warfare.



Nostalgists for the liberal order also betray a shallow conception of their central idea, liberalism. They conflate liberalism with other desirable phenomena, like capitalism and democracy. They neglect the possibility of illiberal democracy, and illiberal capitalism. Majority democratic rule does not equate with, or necessarily produce, a liberal protection of individual rights such as the presumption of innocence or trial by jury, a liberal tolerance for opposition and dissent, or a constitutional order that separates powers and constrains government through an independent judiciary or a free press. Capitalism can also be illiberal, as the Chinese Communist Party demonstrates. One of America’s long‐​term allies, Singapore, evolved as a supervised market democracy that curtailed the right to dissent. South Korea, an ally and protectorate within America’s Asian system, evolved first as a dictatorship under authoritarian founding fathers who were also modernizers, Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee. These authoritarians nurtured the _chaebol_ business groups, Hyundai, Daewoo, and Samsung. Free markets took root first as highly protected markets under unfree political conditions. Such contradictions are absent from liberal‐​order panegyrics.



As it is recalled, the “liberal order” embodies the permanent commitment of the United States to alliances and institutions without coercion. A broader historical perspective suggests, however, that Trump’s coercive treatment of allies is less of a break with the past than is often thought. In reality, the United States has often coerced allies with threats of abandonment and punishment.66 In 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles threatened Europe with an “agonizing reappraisal” of alliances. In 1973 and 1974, President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger suspended intelligence and nuclear cooperation with Britain to punish noncooperation over a U.S.-initiated declaration of principles and the privacy of bilateral and UK‐​European Economic Community discussions. The United States has used the threat of abandonment to persuade allies and clients to cancel their nuclear programs, including West Germany, Japan, and Taiwan, while threatening adversaries with sanctions or preventive war. The demand that European allies shoulder more of the burden of military expenditure has been a staple of U.S. diplomacy, from President Eisenhower to former secretary of defense Robert Gates. Despite Britain spending blood and treasure in Afghanistan and Iraq to support the war on terror and cement its standing in Washington, President Obama made a blunt threat that departing from the European Union would place the UK at the “back of the queue” when seeking a bilateral free trade agreement. Assured commitment to institutions and allies through only positive solidarity is a false memory. This underlines the pattern whereby Washington underwrites a liberal world order not by adhering to its principles but by stepping outside them, practicing punishment, threats, and bribes that it would not accept if directed at itself. 



In “liberal order” litanies, another persistent claim is that the order was “rules‐​based.” It was not. Rules exist, and flouting them can have costs. But at critical moments for strong states such as the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, rules proved to be slippery; they were invoked, stretched, arbitrarily altered, or ignored, as interest permitted. The unreality of nostalgic legalism was illustrated in the summer of 2016 by two adversaries who both at different times have appealed to “rules” as the arbiter of international order. China defied the unanimous ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which found against its territorial claims, and continued to expand into the South China Sea and seize disputed waters, islands, and shoals. At the same time, the United States appealed to China to respect the “legally binding” verdict yet had not even ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that it urged China to observe. From ignoring the International Court of Justice over the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1986 to bombing Serbia in 1999 without a UN mandate, the United States has infringed on the letter of international law when it has found that other interests or values were compelling. It exercised a vigilante’s privilege. So too did other major powers. For less powerful and emerging states, the writ of liberal order was often remote, as they “routed around” rules to pursue their interests. In this century, Africa, from the Great Lakes region to the Sudan, has seen millions butchered, displaced, and unavenged. The era may have involved greater degrees of “rule following” than earlier eras. But it was not “based” on the observation of rules, at least not for the major powers. To rebrand this fraught history of power politics as an era of rule‐​bound civility is perverse. There is nothing intrinsically wrong in calling for the conservation, or restoration, of an order on the basis that it represents something better. In this case, though, the nostalgia rests on delusion — about what the world was and what it can be.



The debate around “liberal order” is consequential. Memories of what went before will condition the ability of the United States and its allies to navigate their way ahead. At issue here is neither the legitimacy of American power in the world nor many of its benefits. If there was to be a superpower emerging from the rubble of world war in midcentury, we should be grateful it was the United States, given the totalitarian alternatives on offer. Under America’s aegis, there were islands of liberty where prosperous markets and democracies grew. U.S. internationalism rebuilt Western Europe and East Asia and successfully contained Soviet communism. The central issue is whether this created a wider “liberal” system, and whether the actual historic process of world ordering can even be achieved by liberal means. The answer, in both cases, is no. Even at its zenith, America did not have the power to reorder the world so fundamentally. Its more ambitious efforts to do so generated illiberal as well as liberal results. The limits on power and knowledge are too strong for any world ordering to be so straightforward and benign.



How do we best explain these contradictions? The most accurate answer is not that the United States cynically preached liberalism while practicing realpolitik. Liberalism is an authentic and powerful engine of U.S. diplomacy. It is a pillar of the American diplomatic mind. But it was never all‐​conquering. Long before Trump, large swaths of the globe (and of American statecraft) were unsubjugated by it. Today’s lamentations confuse two phenomena, liberal ideals and institutions on one hand and a hegemon’s world ordering on the other. To underwrite the order it promoted, the superpower exercised prerogatives in ways that cannot adequately be labelled “liberal,” implicitly claiming a privilege to do so. Except in atypical circumstances, large liberal projects require murky bargains. At worst they contain the seeds of their own unraveling, especially in the countries that become laboratories for the most doctrinaire attempts.



Endless recall of the “liberal order” is not only ahistorical. It is harmful. It damages the intellectual capacity to diagnose the failures of the recent past. It harms the effort to construct a workable design for the future. It impedes Washington from undertaking a needed reassessment of its grand strategy that has put the United States where it now is: struggling under the weight of spiraling debt, confronting multiplying foreign conflicts and domestic discord, and set on a collision course with rivals. Appeals to take up the burden, again, of spreading liberalism overseas presupposes the worldview of idealistic technocrats, confident in their capacity to reprogram the world despite growing evidence to the contrary. At a time when a sober reappraisal and some retrenchment is needed, both Trump and his critics undermine that task by peddling ahistorical reductionism. There is a better, non‐​Trumpian critique to be made of a failing foreign policy consensus, and on behalf of an alternative order based on a wiser combination of restraint, deterrence, and power sharing.



A review of the United States’ current grand strategic situation suggests that a clear‐​eyed stock taking is in order. Trump’s presidency doesn’t signify a general retrenchment of the United States and a retreat from international commitments. Under Trump, Washington’s growing commitments still exceed its power. The United States feels its capacity to impose order strained, even with the significant investments it already makes. As Richard Betts once suggested of the annual defense budget, half a trillion dollars is more than enough.67 It is in the size of the policy ambition relative to capabilities, rather than merely the size of those capabilities, where the dangerous imbalance lies. Despite his threats to overturn the old order, the power of the foreign policy establishment and its habitual ideas have steered Trump to quickly conform to the fundamentals of traditional U.S. grand strategy.68 He now aggressively reasserts U.S. primacy. If he poses a danger, it is not from abandonment but overreach. On its current course, the United States is prone to two forms of self‐​inflicted wounds: self‐​encirclement, whereby a state undermines its own security by provoking resistance and counterpower; and imperial overextension, whereby a state expands to the point where the costs outstrip the benefits.69



The United States is accumulating record deficits and growing, unsustainable debts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal debt will reach 150 percent of GDP by 2047.70 Because repayment obligations are the first, compulsory items in expenditure and because heavy fiscal burdens beyond a certain proportion of debt‐​to‐​GDP tend to choke economic growth,71 a growing debt load directly impedes the country’s ability to sustain its way of life alongside its extensive international commitments. U.S. grand strategy also gives Washington a proclivity to continuous wars that it chooses to fund through deficits. According to one estimate, U.S. wars from 2001 to 2016 had a budgetary cost of approximately $4.79 trillion, taking into account indirect costs such as interest on borrowing and through‐​life care for veterans.72 Those wars have led to further geopolitical crises and demand for further commitment. Conflict‐​induced anarchy in Iraq and Libya created footholds for the Islamic State and, by upsetting the balance of power in the Persian Gulf, opened the way to a Saudi‐​Iran cold war that now implicates the United States.



The Trump administration has not reversed this imbalance but aggravated it. It has significantly increased the defense budget, while significantly reducing taxes. It has embarked on a deficit‐​financed military buildup, a pattern that historically increases imbalances in the economy and triggers a “boom‐​bust” cycle, and where overreaching wars (like Iraq) and financial meltdowns (like the global financial crisis) are linked.73 The final 2018 defense budget is expected to be 13 percent higher than that of 2017.74 The United States’ grand strategy of primacy saddles it with defense and national security expenditures that amount to over 68 percent of discretionary spending, taking into account the base budget and overseas contingency operations and support for veterans affairs, homeland security, and the nuclear weapons program.75



Meanwhile, the overall direction so far of President Trump’s foreign policy has been to multiply America’s security commitments and entanglements. The United States has implicated itself more deeply in the geopolitics of the Persian Gulf. Trump has intensified America’s confrontation with Iran by abandoning the multiparty settlement on Iran’s nuclear program. He has reinforced U.S. patronage of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf monarchies, while hardening Washington’s alignment with Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as its capital. By November 2017, Trump had increased the number of troops and civilians working for the Department of Defense in the Middle East by 33 percent.76 At the time of writing, the status of America’s commitment in Syria is not clear, with the administration both promising to withdraw yet indicating it would stay to defeat the remnants of the Islamic State, and threatening to continue to punish Syria for chemical weapons use. He increased the U.S. commitment to the Afghanistan‐​Pakistan theater. Lastly, the Trump administration’s _National Security_ _Strategy_ openly acknowledges competition against “revisionist” powers Russia and China.77 And its _Nuclear Posture_ _Review_ expands the conditions under which the United States would threaten nuclear use and plans an increased arsenal of low‐​yield nuclear bombs.78 Escalating rivalries are the likely result. Not only is this imbalance between power and commitments financially difficult to service. It also makes the country harder to govern. Recurrent clashes over federal budgets and the increasing tradeoffs between consumption, investment, and defense lead to periods of paralysis. We see a dangerous interaction between domestic discord and foreign policy failure.



These deteriorating circumstances make it imperative for Washington to conduct a cold reassessment of its grand strategy. It needs to ask what works and what doesn’t, to rank its interests into a hierarchy and distinguish what is vital from what is desirable, to assess what is achievable, and what costs and sacrifices it can bear. The growing demand on already scarce resources, from the mounting costs of defense to the current and future burdens of entitlements, means that it will be difficult for the superpower to increase its extraction of resources from its population base. For a reassessment to be realistic, the country must be able to consider retrenchment, burden shifting, the accommodation of potential rivals, and the limitation of commitments. History suggests strategies that bring a state’s power and commitments into balance and that can successfully prevent overstretch, insolvency, or exhaustion.79 To do this, decisionmakers can draw on an American tradition of prudential, realist thinking about aligning resources and goals. As Samuel P. Huntington summarized it, to address the gap between ambitions and capabilities, states can attempt



to redefine their interests and so reduce their commitments to a level which they can sustain with their existing capabilities; to reduce the threats to their interests through diplomacy; to enhance the contribution of allies to the protection of their interests; to increase their own resources, usually meaning larger military forces and military budgets; to substitute cheaper forms of power for more expensive ones, thus using the same resources to produce more power; to devise more effective strategies for the use of their capabilities, thereby securing also greater output in terms of power for the same input in terms of resources.80



If, however, Washington is held to a fictitious and demanding historical standard, this exercise will be impossible. If “liberal order” visions prevail, it will be deemed immoral even to consider an alternative of restraint. A pernicious byproduct of such nostalgia is its reductionism, whereby traditionalists assert a false choice between primacy or “global leadership” on one hand and inward‐​looking isolation on the other. Accordingly, advocates of primacy brand today’s realists who call for retrenchment as Trumpian.81 By contrast, if Washington can be liberated from the burdensome historical fantasy that hegemonic nostalgists impose upon it, then it can gain a clearer‐​sighted appreciation of the choices now before it.

Dr. Roger Pielke Sr. reports that there’s a new paper out with a fun title, based on that famous for Robert A. Heinlein quote : Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.
“The Climate Is Not What You Expect” By S. Lovejoy and D. Schertzer 2012
The abstract reads: (emphasis added by Pielke)
Prevailing definitions of climate are not much different from “the climate is what you expect, the weather is what you get”. Using a variety of sources including reanalyses and paleo data, and aided by notions and analysis techniques from Nonlinear Geophysics, we argue that this dictum is fundamentally wrong. In addition to the weather and climate, there is a qualitatively distinct intermediate regime extending over a factor of ≈ 1000 in scale.
For example, mean temperature fluctuations increase up to about 5 K at 10 days (the lifetime of planetary structures), then decrease to about 0.2 K at 30 years, and then increase again to about 5 K at glacial-interglacial scales. Both deterministic GCM’s with fixed forcings (“control runs”) and stochastic turbulence-based models reproduce the first two regimes, but not the third. The middle regime is thus a kind of low frequency “macroweather” not “high frequency climate”. Regimes whose fluctuations increase with scale appear unstable whereas regimes where they decrease appear stable. If we average macroweather states over periods ≈ 30 years, the results thus have low variability. In this sense, macroweather is what you expect.
We can use the critical duration of ≈ 30 years to define (fluctuating) “climate states”. As we move to even lower frequencies, these states increasingly fluctuate – appearing unstable so that the climate is not what you expect. The same methodology allows us to categorize climate forcings according to whether their fluctuations decrease or increase with scale and this has important implications for GCM’s and for climate change and climate predictions.
The conclusion reads:
Contrary to [Bryson, 1997], we have argued that the climate is not accurately viewed as the statistics of fundamentally fast weather dynamics that are constrained by quasi fixed boundary conditions. The empirically substantiated picture is rather one of unstable (high frequency) weather processes tending – at scales beyond 10 days or so and primarily due to the quenching of spatial degrees of freedom – to quasi stable (intermediate frequency, low variability) macroweather processes. Climate processes only emerge from macroweather at even lower frequencies, and this thanks to new slow  internal climate processes coupled with external forcings. Their synergy yields fluctuations that on average again grow with scale and become dominant typically on time scales of 10 – 30 years up to ≈ 100 kyrs.
Looked at another way, if the climate really was what you expected, then – since one expects averages – predicting the climate would be a relatively simple matter. On the contrary, we have argued that from the stochastic point of view – and notwithstanding the vastly different time scales – that predicting natural climate change is very much like predicting the weather. This is because the climate at any time or place is the consequence of climate changes that are (qualitatively and quantitatively) unexpected in very much the same way that the weather is unexpected.
Pielke writes:
There are a series of informative comments on this paper by Judy Curry, Philip Richens, Shaun Lovejoy and others on the weblog All Models are Wrong post
Limitless Possibilities
In the insightful comment by Shaun Lovejoy on that weblog, he does write on one issue that I disagree with. Shaun writes
“….deterministic models (GCM’s) reproduce only weather and macroweather statistics (they do this quite well)”.
I agree on weather, but not on macroweather. Macroweather prediction has shown little, if any skill ; e.g. see the papers listed in my post

"Westpac has promised to stop supporting thermal coalmining, joining other major financial institutions in promising it will not back the fossil fuel industry through investments or loans beyond 2030. It leaves ANZ as the only big Australian bank not to have pledged to get out of thermal coal, the dirtiest fuel used in mass electricity generation.  Environmental activists said Westpac’s commitment, which over the next decade includes not taking on new thermal coal customers and limiting support for mines or projects in existing coal basins, was “another nail in the coffin” of the thermal coal industry. It came as Westpac decided to not pay an interim dividend to shareholders after it posted a first-half profit slide because of hefty impairment charges related mainly to the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia’s second-largest lender reported a 70% slump in cash earnings to $993m for the six months ended 31 March, from $3.30bn a year earlier. Net profit was down 62% to $1.19bn. A bank statement released on Monday said Westpac recognised climate change was one of the most significant issues that would affect long-term prosperity of the global economy “and our way of life”. It committed the bank to managing its business in alignment with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, including a transition to an economy that has “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a list of principles, the bank said climate change was a financial risk, that addressing it would create opportunities and called for the re-introduction of a carbon price. It promised to lend another $3.5bn to climate solutions over the next three years and ensure its financing of electricity plants supported a path to zero emissions. “Westpac’s preferred policy position is that a broad, market-based price on carbon is the most effective, affordable, flexible and equitable means of achieving emissions reductions at the least cost across the economy,” it said. On thermal coal, it said it would support existing customers as it reduces its exposure to the fossil fuel to zero over the next decade. It would continue to offer finance for metallurgical coal, used in steel production, while supporting technology developments to reduce the steel industry’s dependence on it. On oil and gas, it said it would assess their role in the transition to a low carbon economy while providing finance in line with its commitment to the Paris deal. Climate activist group Market Forces said Westpac’s commitment on electricity lending should “squeeze out” new coal power plants and make it near impossible to finance new gas generation. It pointed to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that found meeting the Paris goal of keeping global heating as close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as possible meant energy from gas must fall 25% below 2010 levels by 2030. The group’s executive director, Julien Vincent, said the bank’s stance was a nail in the coffin of thermal coal and a warning to the federal government if it planned to boost fossil fuels on the way out of the Covid-19 pandemic. “This plan shows it won’t be happening with Westpac’s cooperation,” Vincent said. “Last year, the Commonwealth Bank was the first to commit to be out of thermal coal by 2030 along with all three of our general insurers. Now, anyone trying to operate a coalmine or power station in Australia by the end of this decade will need to do it without Westpac as well.” Market Forces said it hoped the new policy meant Westpac would reverse its recent lending trends, including $5.4bn in loans to coal, oil and gas projects since 2016, far more than the bank made available to renewable energy projects. The activist group found Westpac increased its new investments in fossil fuel projects by 8% in 2018-19 compared with the previous year. The bank said its overall exposure to climate polluting industries, including longstanding investments, fell by 16%. The Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors with funds under management worth about $2tn, said Westpac’s policy was a positive step that reinforced a global trend among international financiers to strike out or limit coal financing. The group’s chief executive, Emma Herd, said in the past few months some of the world’s biggest funders of coal projects, including Japanese banks Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho, had ruled out directly funding new coal plants. Others, such as HSBC, had tightened existing policies. May House, an economic analysts with the Australian Conservation Foundation, welcomed the announcement and called on financial institutions to ensure their financing and investment portfolios were focused on both rebuilding the economy and addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. “For Australia’s big four banks, this does not end at setting an exit date for financing thermal coal, but should extend to ruling out funding any new or expanded oil and gas projects,” she said."

Where will we hold Australia,  
we who have no other country?  
Not Indigenous, merely born here.



Australian politics is periodically rocked by “progressive” fads which generate much sound and fury but ultimately fizzle out because Australians are by and large simply too sensible to indulge such flights of fancy. In the late 90s, it was the Republic push which excited the tiny minds of the inner-city left. But while the luvvies worked themselves into a backslapping lather during their aptly-named “Con-Con”, the sensible mass of ordinary Australians overwhelmingly rejected it when it came to a referendum. The political-media elite likewise keep assuring each other that their imaginary “climate emergency” is “the great moral challenge of our time”: at election after election, Australian voters have quietly begged to differ.



The current fad for Australian “progressives” is a constitutionally-enshrined “Indigenous Voice”. Even the elites are slowly realising that enshrining racial separatism in the nation’s foundational legal document is going to be a hard sell. Enthusiasts like Noel Pearson are tying themselves into ever-more ridiculous knots, trying to deny the obvious.



Cape York leader Noel Pearson says the truth is out about the just movement for a First Nations voice in the constitution and now only lies can defeat it.



Which is kind of rich, considering what comes next.



“Our opponents in the Institute of Public Affairs attempt to put a liberal philosophical sheen on Andrew Bolt’s argument that a First Nations voice would constitute separate treatment on the basis of race in the constitution,” he said.



“This argument succeeds only if you ignore the truth that our claim is on the basis of our being indigenous to this country, not on the basis of race.”



  
If Pearson has finished calling a spade a rectangular manual earth-moving implement, perhaps he would care to explain how that **isn’t** about race?



He might also care to reconcile that claim with his previous statement that:



The essence of indigeneity … is that people have a connection with their ancestors whose bones are in the soil. Whose dust is part of the sand. I had to come to the somewhat uncomfortable conclusion that even Andrew Bolt was becoming Indigenous because the bones of his ancestors are now becoming part of the territory.



If Pearson truly believes that statement, then I, with generations of ancestors whose bones are in the soil of my land, am as indigenous as he. In which case, separate “indigenous recognition” for he but not for me can **only** be on the basis of his race.



Pearson should just admit that he, like every other Australian, already **is** recognised in the constitution: **This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution shall be binding on the courts, judges, and people of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth**.



What he, like all the other “Voice” proponents really want is a constitutionally enshrined separate status for just one race of people in Australia. **Apartheid** , we used to call that.

"**Moderna is filing for US and European emergency regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use.**
Regulators will look at trial data for the mRNA vaccine and decide if it is safe and effective enough to recommend for roll out.
Clinical studies show the jab is more than 94% effective at protecting people from becoming ill with Covid-19.
Pfizer, which has a similar jab, has already filed for the same US approval.
UK regulators are also reviewing data on the Pfizer vaccine, as well as another type of Covid vaccine from AstraZenca and Oxford University for emergency approval.
Moderna says it hopes to gain UK approval soon, now that it has trial data from 30,000 volunteers - including high risk groups like the elderly - that suggests it works.
In those studies, 15,000 people received the real vaccine while the other participants got placebo injections. No serious side effects were reported.
During the studies, 185 people in the placebo group fell ill with Covid-19, and some severely so.
In comparison, there were 11 cases in the vaccine group and none were severe.
Full trial data has not been released, but will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course.
The three front-runner vaccines have different pros and cons.
The AstraZeneca jab is cheaper - around Â£3 ($4) for a dose, compared to around Â£15 ($20) for the Pfizer vaccine and Â£25 ($33) for Moderna's.
And it is potentially easier to distribute because it does not need to be stored under ultra-low temperatures.
But its efficacy in trials - between 62% and 90% - is a bit lower than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines:
Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: ""This is great news indeed - the more trial data that we have, the greater confidence we have that vaccines can be used to blunt the human cost of Covid-19.
""As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public.""
Meanwhile, the UK's new minister responsible for vaccine rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, said vaccination would not be compulsory, but that society might expect people to get immunised.
He told BBC's World At One: ""I think the very strong message that you will see, this is the way we return the whole country, and so it's good for your family, it's good for your community, it's good for your country to be vaccinated.
""And, ultimately people will have to make a decision."""

The draft national curricular standards released yesterday, as I wrote earlier, will in all likelihood do little or no educational good if adopted. They'll either be ignored or, if hard to meet, dumbed-down.   
  
That said, the really troubling question is not whether the standards will do any good, but whether they will do much harm.   
  
The answer: Oh, they'll do harm. They'll move us one step closer to complete centralization of education, which portends many potentially bad things, from total special-interest domination to even more wasteful spending.   
  
Perhaps the most concerning possibility is that complete centralization -- meaning, federalization -- will lead to nationwide conflict over what the schools should teach, much as we are seeing in Texas right now and witnessed in the 1990s, the last time Washington tried to push ""voluntary"" national standards. Back then national standards in several subjects were proposed, and a national firestorm was set off over what they did, and did not, contain.   




The Common Core State Standards Initiative folks clearly learned from the nineties experience, assiduously avoiding even the appearance of mandating the reading of specific literary works and focusing instead on skills. (The draft standards include a lot of reading exemplars but don't require knowledge of any specific literary pieces). As a result, the response so far seems much less heated than occurred in the nineties, though critiques of the proposed standards certainly do exist. Once control over language arts skills and mathematics is fully centralized, however, can we really expect specific content standards in literature and other subjects to be left entirely to states and districts?   
  
It seems unlikely: Once Washington connects receipt of federal funding to performance on national standards for some subjects, it is very likely to expand into others. After all, aren't science, history, and other topics as important as reading and math?   
  
""Promoting"" science is a huge favorite of federal politicians, so it's certainly hard to imagine science -- and the freighted questions about human origins and climate change that go with it -- not becoming a target for nationalization. Similarly, since many public schooling advocates argue that we must have government schools to create good citizens, it's hard to envision the controversy-laden subjects of history and civics not entering the sites of federal politicians. And when they do, we can either expect the sparks to fly, or the standards that are set to be so milquetoast as to be meaningless.   
  
Wait. Am I being overly alarmist about this, trying to start a trumped-up slippery-slope scare to undermine the current national standards push?   
  
Nope. National standards supporters are already talking about targeting science and history. For instance, in the forward to _International Lessons about National Standards_, a recent report from the national-standards-loving Thomas B. Fordham Institute, it is written about the CCSSI: 





Our authors would prefer for science to be included in this first round, and we’d like to get to history sooner rather than later.



And Fordham is not alone. Indeed, the CCSSI folks have already been talking about creating national science and social studies standards!   
  
When should all kids learn evolution, if at all? How much Hispanic history should students know? How many Founding Fathers should high school grads be able to identify? What caused the Civil War? Is global warming a major threat? Are we a Christian nation? How these and numerous other bitterly contested questions will officially be answered will suddenly have to be duked out by every American, and the winners will get to dictate to the entire nation.   
  
So the language arts and math standards revealed yesterday are, almost certainly, just the camel's nose under the tent. Unfortunately, that means the whole destructive beast isn't far behind.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA November 11, 2013 press release by Austria’s national weather service, the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), somehow got by me. And not surprisingly it was completely ignored by the German-language mainstream media. It’s titled: “Slower temperature increase: climate models under scrutiny“.
In the introduction the ZAMG writes:
If one compares the temperature development of the last 15 years to the simulations from the new climate model generation, then one sees a substantial deviation between reality and model: the so-called temperature hiatus.”
Air temperature is the preferred parameter that experts use to gauge climate change. On the hiatus the ZAMG writes, “In the last 15 years there has been a clear weakening in the global temperature rise; only 3 of 114 climate model simulations account for it (Figure 1).”

Figure 1: Change in global near-surface temperature relative to the 1986–2005 period from observation data (black) and model simulations (coloured) (IPCC 2013).
As possible causes for the unexpected temperature hiatus, the ZAMG cites: 1) the 11-year solar cycle, 2) volcanic activity, 3) internal climate variability and 4) man-made aerosols. Keep in mind that man-made aerosols have long been dubiously used as the preferred wild card to explain away deviations between models and observations. If there’s a misfit, no problem! Just adjust the aerosol weighting in the model until it there’s a fit! Never mind small details like reality.
Interestingly, the ZAMG also brings up global winter temperature trends and provides the following chart.

Figure 2: Winter linear trends of near surface temperatures for the period 1987–2010 from CRUTEM3 data in in degrees C per decade (Cohen u.a. 2012b).
Note how the northern hemisphere winters are cooling dramatically. Ed Caryl recently wrote a piece on this and a couple of readers got a bit pissy about the claim wintertime temps are cooling. Well, here’s more proof that they indeed really are cooling. What more do you want?
So why are the models deviating so starkly from reality? The ZAMG writes:
Why the global climate models are by far over-estimating the current temperature development – and thus obviously are not taking the processes behind it correctly – is the topic of discussion and is now the subject of ongoing research. According to the latest expert report, it could be an error in missing or incorrect radiative forcing, or a false reaction by the climate model to external drives. Moreover, some of the climate models are likely reacting too much to the concentrations of greenhouse gases.”
In layman’s terms: The modelers have no clue what’s wrong, and they are not even close to properly modeling the climate. The sheer simplicity of their models, when compared to the enormous complexity of the climate system, is a joke.
The Austrian ZAMG concludes:
The research results of the last year make it ever clearer that natural fluctuations in climate are substantial. The current temperature hiatus shows that the climate system is not understood in its full complexity and that the climate models still are not adequate.”
Really makes you wonder about the scientists who claim to be 95% certain. That 5% uncertainty is looming larger than ever.

From “The Hockey Schtick“, some inconvenient truth that breaks Mann’s already broken hockey stick into even smaller pieces. A new paper finds significant cooling of Atlantic Ocean over past millennium, making the MWP warmer in terms of sea surface temperature than today. Since land temperatures (including forest lands of Sheep Mountain and Yamal) respond significantly to ocean temperatures (the ocean is the big kahuna of global heat sinks) it is a pretty safe bet that those favored trees (including YAD 061) experienced warmer temperatures during the MWP than today. The eastern tropical North Atlantic reconstruction of SSTs was based on foraminiferal (marine plankton shells) Mg/Ca ratios that resolves multidecadal variability over the past 1700 years. see below:

The paper, published December 29th, 2011 in the journal Paleoceanography finds that Atlantic Ocean surface temperatures have significantly cooled over the past millennium, since the Medieval Warming Period from about 950-1200 AD.
Summer-Fall Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) shown in top graph. Iceland Sea Surface temperatures have also declined over the past 1200 years (4th graph). Note also the significant increase of solar irradiance from the Little Ice Age 1550-1850 to the latter 20th century (5th graph).Key Points: 

Monsoon season SST is reconstructed for the past 3 millennia
Over the past 1700 years, several intervals show multidecadal SST variability
Late medieval cooling amounts to approximately 0.5 degree Celsius

doi:10.1029/2011PA002130
Multidecadal variability and late medieval cooling of near-coastal sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical North Atlantic 
Henning Kuhnert et al
Multidecadal variations in Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) influence the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. However, prior to the instrumental time period, information on multidecadal climate variability becomes limited, and there is a particular scarcity of sufficiently resolved SST reconstructions. Here we present an eastern tropical North Atlantic reconstruction of SSTs based on foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios that resolves multidecadal variability over the past 1700 years.
Spectral power in the multidecadal band (50 to 70 years period) is significant over several time intervals suggesting that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has been influencing local SST. Since our data exhibit high scatter the absence of multidecadal variability in the remaining record does not exclude the possibility that SST variations on this time scale might have been present without being detected in our data. Cooling by ∼0.5°C takes place between about AD 1250 and AD 1500; while this corresponds to the inception of the Little Ice Age (LIA), the end of the LIA is not reflected in our record and SST remains relatively low.
This transition to cooler SSTs parallels the previously reconstructed shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation toward a low pre-20th century mean state and possibly reflects common solar forcing.

"**A mass Covid-19 vaccination programme will need the full support of the executive in order to be delivered, the Ulster Unionist Party leader has said.**
Steve Aiken urged the first and deputy first ministers to present a united front on the importance of the vaccine.
Mr Aiken said Northern Ireland was moving to ""a critical stage"" of the pandemic.
On Sunday, the Department of Health reported three more coronavirus-related deaths and 351 new cases in NI.
It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test, to 986.
GPs in NI are preparing for a mass vaccination programme to begin next month.
Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics Mr Aiken said: ""All of the executive should be working together and getting the same message out.
""Now is not the time for backbiting but what we must be doing is supporting [Robin Swann] because we must support our health service to get through this stage.""
Mr Aiken said he would ""love"" the first and deputy first ministers to ""keep coherent with the message they have come out with in the past week"", saying ""they must do that because we're moving to a critical stage"" of the pandemic.
Speaking about the vaccines, Mr Aiken said: ""I really do hope that the various vaccines, their efficacy will be proved and they will be given the approval for their rollout to start.""
He called on Stormont to focus on helping the economy to recover and dealing with the pandemic in the new year.
""We need to be doing this to be able to make sure we can come out the other side and make sure our health service isn't overwhelmed,"" he said.
The UUP leader added that the ""most important thing"" for the people of Northern Ireland to doing was to support the health minister.
On Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland.
It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983.
Meanwhile, it emerged that GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January.
Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date.
Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks.
The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups.
GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland relying on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed, according to a letter from the Health and Social Care Board sent to GP practices.
The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien.
""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien.
""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme.""
""This is the light at the end of the tunnel that so many of us have been waiting for,"" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP committee at the British Medical Association.
Dr Stout said the intention is ""to get started this side of Christmas"" but acknowledged the rollout will be ""massively challenging"".
Health and social care frontline workers are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable.
Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage provisional.
The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health.
Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public."
"Air pollution has a particularly damaging effect on children. They’re still growing and breathe faster than adults do. They also live closer to the ground, where the most polluting gases from vehicles accumulate. Pollution from traffic has been linked to problems with brain development, stunted growth, respiratory conditions, cancers and 300,000 child deaths worldwide. Children themselves are far from oblivious to all this. The school climate strikes show that young people are forcing air pollution and the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda. The strikes tell us that children demand a platform to challenge pollution in their environment. Unable to voice their concerns in school, they are forced to take radical action. What if instead there was a way to work with children in tackling air pollution and climate change? Through my research, I look for ways that we can give children the tools, the skills and the confidence to affect change in the cities they live in. With the help of teachers and my colleagues in Open Lab – a research group at Newcastle University – we’ve come up with Sense Explorers, a series of lessons to run in primary schools. Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK has a population of just over 260,000. It’s relatively small, but several areas of the city have illegal levels of air pollution. The culprit? Cars, buses and lorries, all emitting harmful concentrations of polluting gases such as nitrogen dioxide in built-up areas. 


      Read more:
      Why air pollution in schools is such a big deal – and what to do about it


 The children I talked to care about the environment and wanted to see it change for the better – but they have few means to influence that change. In our lessons, we didn’t simply teach school children about environmental issues – we allowed them to learn for themselves what they can do to improve their local environment. First, we took them to streets in their neighbourhood. With the help of some digital tools, including a basic kit we built ourselves, we collected data about air pollution. In our pilot lessons, we gave them a tool that professionals use called the Fidas Frog, a handheld device that monitors fine dust in the air. But when we found this wasn’t so fun or easy for children, we created the Sensor Pi. Using low-cost sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi computer, they could get a rough air pollution reading at the press of a button.  We didn’t just rely on technology – we asked the children to think about what their own five senses were telling them about the street. Could they see or hear what may be causing pollution? We compiled the data they collected and showed it back to them alongside official data. Adults might not expect children to be able to interpret air pollution data, but when we asked them to explain what might be causing peaks in the graphs, they suggested parents in their idling cars, rush-hour traffic and the fumes from local factories. We then asked: if you were in charge of the city, how would you make the situation better? The children proposed many things, including solar-powered cars, separate bridges for people and vehicles, tunnels to keep traffic underground and even electric travelators to replace roads and cars altogether. Many of their ideas to combat pollution could be implemented right now – slowing vehicles down or removing them from the road, providing electric car charging points, filtering the air and getting more people to walk and cycle. These ideas won’t just linger in a teacher’s drawer or decorate a display wall. We’ve worked with four classes in three different schools, and local politicians came to meet all of them to listen and commit to action on their ideas. Schools are the perfect places to encourage children to become environmental activists. It’s where children learn about the future, what it holds for them, and how they can make it better. We should be showing them what they can – and should – do to make their cities less polluted places. Urban planners and politicians are often hesitant to work with children, but they shouldn’t be – we need to embrace their creativity and passion to take radical action on air pollution and climate change. More now than ever, we need the original ideas that only children can bring. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Solution 1: fudge the issue. Just accept that we are Fast-trackers and can therefore get away with anything.

Email 5175-Tom Wigley – 2004
In any simple global formula, there should be at least two clearly identifiable sources of uncertainty. One is the sensitivity (d(melt)/dT) and the other is the total available ice. In the TAR, the latter never comes into it in their analysis (i.e., the ‘derivation’ of the GSIC formula) — but my point is that it *does* come in by accident due to the quadratic fudge factor. The total volume range is 5-32cm, which is, at the very least, inconsistent with other material in the chapter (see below). 5cm is clearly utterly ridiculous.

I will press on with trying to work out why the temperature needs a ‘fudge factor’ along with the poorer modelling for winter.
Email 1461, Milind Kandlikar, 2004
With GCMs the issue is different. Tuning may be a way to fudge the physics. For example, understanding of clouds or aerosols is far from complete – so (ideally) researchers build the “best” model they can within the constraints of physical understanding and computational capacity. Then they tweak parameters to provide a good approximation to observations. It is this context that all the talk about “detuning” is confusing. How does one speak of “detuning” using the same physical models as before? A “detuned” model merely uses a different set of parameters that match observations – it not hard to find multiple combinations of parameters that give the similar model outputs (in complex models with many parameters/degrees of freedom) So how useful is a detuned model that uses old physics? Why is this being seen as some sort of a breakthrough?

The question we should all be asking is where has honest objective journalism gone? Has it been cremated or is it lying in a mass media grave where it has decomposed down to its bare bones?



It doesn’t matter whether it’s what we are viewing, hearing, or reading; 95 per cent of what we are fed is left-wing-biased diatribe. Why is that? Where do today’s so-called journalists get their bias from? Universities? Journalism schools? On the job indoctrination? It’s not hard to come up with the answer. All three.



What we have been witnessing for quite some time now is a global phenomenon amongst all forms of media where there is a compulsion to depict the Left always in a favourable light. It has become a habit with the media that this is done with scant regard for truth or objectivity. What is important is the narrative – THEIR narrative.



Politics, climate change or any number of other subjects which should be debated are not anymore because the media take a stance that they deem to be the right and only one, and if too many alternative views are expressed then the comments are terminated. This, of course, is the modus operandi of the Left. **Rather than encourage debate, shut it down.**



The obvious next step in this sequence brings us to free speech. Free speech is fine with the Left as long as they are the ones doing the speaking, which a dutiful and compliant media will lap up as if they’ve just been given Black Forest cake for dessert. I chose Black Forest cake because it comes from the Black Forest region of Germany which is renowned for its fairy tales, which a lot of the news is nowadays. There is a reservation, though;, I got the idea from CNN talking about the world’s best desserts, so it could very well be FAKE NEWS!



The irony in all of this, of course, is that it is the Left of the media (the vast majority) who are losing viewers, listeners and readers. CNN is a leading example and many others aren’t too far behind.



They need to wake up. Right-wing and conservative readers read the news too.

Few express opinions different from what they are paid to say, and such is equally true for those who work for government. On an almost daily basis, the world is treated to presidential spokespeople denying what most people understand to be true.



Last week, Jason Furman, President Obama’s chief economic adviser, who used to have a reputation as a competent economist, embarrassed himself by trying to deny — in response to a Congressional Budget Office report — that the president’s proposal to increase the minimum wage would cost jobs. Many on the left, including some economists, pretend that the law of supply and demand does not fully apply when it comes to wages. All will admit, however, a $100 an hour minimum wage would be a huge job killer. So what they are really saying, without admitting it, is the political advantages of supporting a smaller increase in the minimum wage outweigh the economic cost, which will primarily be borne by young people and the least skilled (who tend not vote in the same numbers as those who might benefit).



Many of those advocating a higher minimum wage are the same folks who correctly claim that higher taxes on tobacco will reduce smoking over time and argue that higher taxes on carbon will tend to reduce such emissions over time. If higher prices for smokers and carbon emitters change behavior and result in less tobacco and coal being produced, why would not higher labor costs result in fewer workers being hired?



All too many professionals are willing to ignore empirical evidence when it conflicts with their beliefs or those of their employers. Perhaps in no place do we see greater evidence of this than in the field of climate science. Most climate scientists are hired directly or indirectly (i.e., through grants to the institutions that employ them) by governments. A climate scientist whose research showed that climate change is normal and proceeding at a rate that poses no danger to mankind would most likely be excluded from future funding. The political class tends to only spend taxpayer monies on things that directly benefit them or expand their power. During the past three decades, global temperatures have changed more slowly than predicted by 95 percent of the models. There was an 18‐​year period of global warming, but there has been a standstill in global temperature rises for the last 17 years.



If the climate scientists who produced all of these grossly defective, predictive models had been employed by private companies that depended on the accuracy of their predictions, they would have been fired, or at least sent back to start over again. Trying to track all of the things that can affect climate — or the economy — in a model is an extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, task. Private economic forecasters who are consistently wrong tend to lose their credibility and at least some of their income.



There is one group of economic forecasters, though, who suffer very little loss of prestige or income, even though they may often be wrong. They are those who work for the Federal Reserve and other government agencies. The press, out of ignorance or laziness, gives far more coverage and prestige to the “official” forecasts of government agencies than to nongovernment forecasters, many of whom have far better forecast records.



Last week, the Federal Reserve released 1,865 pages of transcripts of its private policy meetings from 2008, the year of the financial crisis. Among the things these documents reveal is that members of the Fed did not understand what was going on with the economy as well as many private analysts and, as usual, were late to react. The members of the Fed also had strong disagreements with each other about the state of the economy and what actions they should take. None of this is particularly surprising, but it should serve as another warning about giving government too much power.



When people take positions in government, they neither become smarter or wiser, but people with power often develop a “fatal conceit” (in the words of F.A. Hayek) that they “know” things they do not know.



The British “Met Office” is responsible for weather forecasts in Britain and has been a promoter of the global warming thesis. In November, the Met Office predicted much drier than normal winters for Britain because of global warming. Instead, Britain has just suffered the wettest winter since records have been kept, resulting in widespread flooding and several deaths. Fatal conceit?

 “Tim, Chris, I hope you’re not right about the lack of warming lasting till about 2020”
Question: If warming really threatens to destroy human civilization, why was Jones hoping for warming?

And if the world was still warming in 2009, why did Jones refer to “lack of warming”?
Email 4195
Tim, Chris, I hope you’re not right about the lack of warming lasting till about 2020.
…
I seem to be getting an email a week from skeptics saying where’s the warming gone. I know the warming is on the decadal scale, but it would be nice to wear their smug grins away.
Maybe he needs a backup plan: 
MacCracken suggests that Phil Jones start working on a “backup” in case Jones’ prediction of warming is wrong

ClimateGate FOIA grepper! – if the sulfate hypothesis is right, then your prediction of warming might end up being wrong
In any case, if the sulfate hypothesis is right, then your prediction of warming might end up being wrong. I think we have been too readily explaining the slow changes over past decade as a result of variability–that explanation is wearing thin. I would just suggest, as a backup to your prediction, that you also do some checking on the sulfate issue, just so you might have a quantified explanation in case the prediction is wrong. Otherwise, the Skeptics will be all over us–the world is really cooling, the models are no good, etc. And all this just as the US is about ready to get serious on the issue.
We all, and you all in particular, need to be prepared.
Best, Mike MacCracken [Note that Obama’s chief science advisor, John Holdren, is copied on this email]

"**The US could see ""surge upon surge"" of coronavirus cases as people return home from the Thanksgiving holiday, a top US disease expert has warned.**
Speaking on Sunday, Dr Anthony Fauci said it was ""not too late"" for those yet to travel to help curb the virus by wearing masks and socially distancing.
Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US.
The US has recorded more than 13 million coronavirus cases and more than 266,000 people have died.
As of Sunday, the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in November has surpassed four million, double the figure recorded in October.
Last year, an estimated 26 million people passed through US airports in the week surrounding the holiday.
Health experts had called for people to spend Thanksgiving at home, but this week US airports marked their busiest period since mid-March.
Anywhere from 800,000 to more than one million travellers passed through US airport checkpoints on any day during the past week, according to Transport Security Administration statistics.
""There is almost certainly going to be an uptick because of what has happened with the travel,"" Dr Fauci told CNN's State of the Union.
In another television appearance, he recommended Thanksgiving travellers to quarantine for a period of time ""if it's possible"".
Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, echoed Dr Fauci's concerns, telling CBS News that people who had travelled for the holiday should avoid seeing relatives over the age of 65.
""Now we're entering this post-Thanksgiving surge with three, four and 10 times as much disease across the country,"" she said. ""We are deeply worried"".
Meanwhile, in **New York City** Mayor Bill de Blasio says schools can reopen in December, weeks after they were shut for a second time. Parents had complained that bars and restaurants were able to operate, but not schools.
And in **California** , Los Angeles county is imposing a new three-week lockdown from Monday, which will ban most public gatherings and limit the number of people allowed in shops at any one time.
This coming week, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is set to discuss the rollout of the vaccine with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Dr Fauci said the vaccine offered a ""light at the end of the tunnel""."

The Thai people have voted. The crony populists decisively defeated the establishment thugs. It probably was the best outcome among imperfect choices.



Thailand has been in various stages of political crisis for years. The only good news is that while Thailand is Southeast Asia’s second‐​largest economy, even the worst political chaos there affects no vital American interest. Long‐​term stability will come only if the country’s ruling elite is willing to cede power to the disaffected and heretofore neglected rural majority.



The Thai monarchy was made famous by _The King and I_ and lost its absolute power seventy‐​nine years ago. In recent years, parliamentary democracy and powerful army have uneasily coexisted: over the years there have been eleven coups, seven attempted coups, twenty‐​three military governments, and nine military‐​dominated regimes. Helping provide political stability was King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a widely revered figure able to call even military rulers to account.





It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new.



This system is breaking down, however. The king is eighty‐​three and has been hospitalized since late 2009. The crown prince enjoys little of the respect accorded his father and some Thai citizens have proposed bypassing him for his sister or even jumping to one of his young sons.



Moreover, a decade ago a frustrated rural majority rallied behind billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra to overthrow the country’s cozy political establishment. Thaksin promised to share the wealth, winning elections — and, it was charged, growing wealthier himself — in return. He became prime minister in 2001, only to be ousted in a coup in 2006.



Unfortunately, King Bhumibol has been increasingly unable to intervene even if he was inclined to act. Worse, the courtiers surrounding him and the queen allied themselves with the military and other elites. The judiciary also was firmly in establishment hands, an important factor where political outcomes often are determined by judges.



With Thaksin living in Dubai to avoid prison, the military rewrote the constitution to restrict the power of elected officials — not to protect the people, like the original U.S. Constitution, but to safeguard the ruling coalition of royalists, businessmen, military officers, and bureaucrats. They relied on the misnamed Democrat Party as their political vehicle. However, Thaksin’s successor party won a plurality of seats in the 2007 vote and formed a coalition government.



The courts then disqualified a succession of pro‐​Thaksin parliamentarians, parties, and prime ministers on dubious charges — one of the latter, for instance, was ousted for being paid to host a televised cooking show. In contrast, the DP, which had not won even a plurality of the vote since 1992, received much kindlier treatment when charged with legal violations.



So‐​called “Yellow Shirt” demonstrators took over the prime minister’s office and international airport, demanding the government’s ouster and constitutional changes to disenfranchise the rural majority, and the army refused to restore order. Thailand’s strict lese‐​majeste laws were largely deployed against Thaksin supporters — there were 164 cases in 2009 alone — as establishment forces charged him with planning to downgrade the monarchy. (Even foreigners, including an American blogger and an Australian novelist living in Thailand, have ended up behind bars for mild or indirect criticism of things royal.) Behind the scenes the court and army pressured coalition partners to switch sides, finally turning the government over to the Democrat Party.



As largely urban dwellers, the Yellow Shirts had an obvious advantage in organizing protests. But in 2009 and 2010 Thaksin loyalists, known as Red Shirts, managed to fill Bangkok, first to disrupt an ASEAN summit and later to shut down much of the financial district. The military conveniently decided that this time public demonstrations threatened Thailand’s security and bloodily evicted the protestors. At least 91 people died and more than 1800 were wounded; opposition leaders were prosecuted and imprisoned.



Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva spoke of reconciliation while continuing to demonize the Red Shirts. Thaksin turned to his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, to carry his banner for the Puea Thai Party in the July 3 election. She promised to increase the minimum wage, hike subsidies for the elderly, expand price supports, initiate tax relief and provide a host of other benefits. The normally more fiscally responsible DP responded accordingly, but populism lite offered little electoral appeal. Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan‐​ocha staged a televised attack on the Puea Thai Party, but could not staunch the anger of Red Shirt activists.



The result was a decisive victory for 44‐​year‐​old Yingluck. Her party took 265 seats in a 500‐​member parliament, compared to just 159 for the DP. A party formed by the general who staged the 2006 coup won two seats.



Yingluck immediately moved to form a coalition with four smaller parties, giving her government nearly 299 seats. Strengthening her coalition makes it harder for opponents to again use the judiciary to win back political control. The electoral commission said it was investigating election violations which could lead to the disqualification of candidates — and no one expects an objective judgment.



The military promised to respect the election result. Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said: “We are not going to intervene.” But leading officers disclaimed any interest in staging a coup before the last one. Activists opposed to Puea Thai’s victory have promised protests and in a majority of those polled by the Bangkok Post said they expect political violence in the future.



The putative prime minister faces an extraordinary challenge. The members of the frustrated and long‐​marginalized majority who voted for her expect a better future, even though her policies could wreck the government budget, business climate and national economy. Her brother hopes for an amnesty which would allow him to return home, a step which would enrage his opponents.



Dealing with the traditional ruling institutions accustomed to occupying the commanding heights of power likely will be even harder for Yingluck. Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Singapore’s Institute of South East Asian Studies observed: “I think one of her biggest challenges is how to build a working relationship with the elite, particularly the military.” Indeed, Christophe Archambault, who covered Thailand for 17 years for Reuters, warned that her tenure could be short: “The establishment is likely to resort again to Yellow Shirt mob violence, a judicial intervention, or even another coup to unseat her. That will tear Thailand further apart.”



There is much scuttlebutt about the potential of striking a deal or even having struck a deal before the election to protect the military from prosecution for the 2006 coup and last year’s crackdown on the Red Shirts in return for accepting a Yingluck government. One can imagine the appeal to the Thaksin forces of such an arrangement.



But the incoming prime minister’s ultimate objective should be to strip establishment institutions of their ability to effectively invalidate elections when they don’t like the results. One young voter declared: “It’s been a so‐​called democracy, not a real democracy. This time I’d like the majority to decide the winner. I really want democracy to decide the outcome.”



Of course, confronting thuggish elites requires a firm government hand, strong political base, and steely personal nerves. A similar process took years in Turkey, in which the so‐​called Deep State dominated by the military and other elites used the courts and laws protecting the image of Turkey founder Kemal Attaturk to maintain their influence irrespective of election results. A Thai government that demonstrates economic success would be far better positioned to undertake far‐​reaching political reforms.



There’s not much Washington, which urged the outgoing government to respect the election result, or anyone else can do other than counsel caution, patience, reconciliation and compromise. Thitinan Pongsudhirak of the Institute of Security and International Studies observed: “We must take the long view. This is not a two‐​year or a three‐​year exercise. We are talking about two or three decades of political maturation to come. It will be many years before we can reconcile the old order and the new order.”



It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new. If not, the Thai people will need all the good wishes they can get to manage the future.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Washington in style, with a state dinner and speech to Congress. He brought with him plans for a more expansive international role for his country, but the military burden of defending Japan will continue to fall disproportionately on America.



World War II still hangs over Japan and its relations with neighboring states. As occupying power, the U.S. imposed the “peace constitution” on Tokyo, with Article Nine banning possession of a military. As the Cold War developed, however, Washington recognized that a rearmed Japan could play an important security role.



Japanese officials equaled American politicians in creatively interpreting their nation’s fundamental law—Tokyo established “Self‐​Defense Forces” as opposed to armed forces. However, Japan’s governments hid between the amendment to cap military outlays and limit the SDF’s role, ensuring American protection.



That approach also suited Tokyo’s neighbors, including other U.S. allies, most of which had suffered under Imperial Japan’s brutal occupation. Although not everyone was hostile to Tokyo, Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea especially preferred Japan disarmed and Washington as military guardian. Marine Corps Gen. Henry Stackpole famously referred to U.S. troops in Japan as a “cap in the bottle” to remilitarization.



As America’s economic edge ebbed and the international security challenges grew, Washington urged Tokyo to do more, though under U.S. direction. Movement was glacial, however. Although some members of the ruling LDP, such as Abe, who previously served as prime minister, shared a more nationalist perspective, policy change was limited by the pacifist‐​minded population. In recent years, however, Japanese sentiment has shifted toward a more vigorous military role in the face of an unpredictable North Korea developing both missiles and nuclear weapons and a powerful China growing more confrontational.



This changing environment generated the new “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation,” formally released on Tuesday. Yet the much‐​heralded document—the first revision in 18 years—might deliver less than promised. The guidelines are only aspirational and state that they create no obligations for either government.



More important, the presentation is about Japanese, not American security. In essence, the new standards affirm what should have been obvious all along—Japan will help America defend Japan. For instance, the guidelines discuss responding to “emerging threats to Japan’s peace and security” and “an armed attack against Japan.” Washington commits to “continue to forward deploy combat‐​ready forces in the Asia‐​Pacific region and maintain the ability to reinforce those forces rapidly.” In contrast, there is nothing about Tokyo supporting U.S. defense or security. American interests simply are subsumed in a short section at the end about “cooperation for regional and global peace and security.”



This approach was evident in the Prime Minister Abe’s speech to Congress, when he spoke of maintaining “the peace and security of the Asia‐​Pacific region.” He emphasized “the central pillar that is the U.S.-Japan alliance.” Tokyo’s responsibility, he said, is to “fortify the U.S.-Japan alliance.” He explained that his government is seeking “to enhance the legislative foundations of our security” in order to “make the cooperation between the U.S. military and Japan’s Self‐​Defense Forces even stronger, and the alliance still more solid.” He lauded the new provisions under which Japan would “take yet more responsibility for the peace and stability in the world,” but as examples mostly cited humanitarian and peace‐​keeping operations.





The military burden of defending Japan will continue to fall disproportionately on America.



Even these modest changes won’t come easily. Abe enjoys a large legislative majority, but his coalition partner, necessary to reach two‐​thirds, opposes amending Article Nine. The public also is skeptical: last year demonstrations erupted against Abe’s defense proposals and one protestor set himself on fire, forcing the government to adjust its plans. A recent Pew Research poll found that only 29 percent of Japanese supported new legislation to implement the guidelines. Just 23 percent wanted their government to be more active militarily.



Nor is there any guarantee that Tokyo will aggressively implement the new standards if passed. A Foreign Ministry spokesman treated as a great advance the fact that the new rules would allow a Japanese ship on patrol with an American vessel to render aid if the latter was attacked—something which most Americans would see as inherent to any genuine “alliance.” However, Tokyo professor Narushige Michishita argued that “technically” the new rules would not allow Japan to defend a U.S. ship if Japan’s security was not directly threatened. Moreover, Tokyo almost certainly would do its best to avoid situations where combat might be involved. Opined Japanese scholar Jun Okumura, “We will wait a long time before a destroyer is conveniently nearby when the Chinese [navy] attacks the U.S. 7th Fleet.”



Worse, Japan’s military outlays were essentially flat over the last decade while Washington, and more ominously for Japan, the People’s Republic of China, dramatically increased military expenditures. Tokyo’s annual spending of some $50 billion annually is about one‐​third to one‐​fourth as much as the PRC (estimates of China’s real spending vary). Focusing SDF resources on non‐​military duties, as suggested by Abe in his speech, actually would inflate the PRC’s military edge, with the U.S. left to fill the widening gap.



Obviously Abe expects the two nations’ basic roles to remain the same. Tokyo’s job is non‐​combat. Abe touted his nation’s “proactive contribution to peace based on the principle of international cooperation.” That is, Japan will do some relatively costless and riskless social work which will enhance Tokyo’s international reputation. For instance, Japan is prepared to help deal with “terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters and climate change.” Even Tokyo’s potential new “security” duties appear designed to avoid combat—cyber warfare, reconnaissance, mine‐​sweeping, logistics. None of these require a military alliance.



Washington’s job is to do anything bloody or messy. That is, deter and fight wars with other militaries, a task which the prime minister ignored. Some observers talk about the guidelines creating a more equal relationship based on mutual defense, but that isn’t what the new rules say. The U.S. has been responsible for defending Japan. The U.S. continues to be responsible for defending Japan. Indeed, it must do more to defend Japan. Explained President Barack Obama: “I want to reiterate that our treaty commitment to Japan’s security is absolute, and that Article 5 covers all territories under Japan’s administration, including Senkakus Islands.” The Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee reported that both nations’ ministers “confirmed the strategic importance of deploying the most modern an advanced U.S. capabilities to Japan”; “welcomed the deployment” of various American aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ships; and “stressed the importance of sustained cooperation in enhancing Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities” through deployment of additional U.S. weapons. (Many of these likely will go to Okinawa, which already bears a disproportionate burden of America’s “forward presence.”)



Since the PRC is a nuclear power, in practice the U.S. must continue to risk Los Angeles to protect Tokyo. Of course, no one imagines a conflict, let alone one that would go nuclear. However, wars often are not expected and rarely turn out as predicted. Beijing has far more at stake in any East Asian conflict and would be willing to risk much more than would Washington. Confronting China over Japan would not the same as disposing of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, or Serbia.



While America has an obvious interest in Japan’s continued independence, no one imagines a Chinese attempt to conquer Tokyo. Rather, the most likely trigger for conflict today is the Senkaku Islands, a half dozen valueless pieces of rock which have taken on increased importance because of the potential resources around them. Beijing’s claim to what the Chinese call the Diaoyus is as good if not better than that of Japan. That doesn’t justify the PRC using force, but Abe so far has preferred confrontational to compromise—a stance reinforced by Washington’s explicit guarantee.



One provision of the new guidelines directly though anonymously deals with the Senkakus: “If the need arises, the Self‐​Defense Forces will conduct operations to retake an island.” In such an effort the SDF would expect to work with U.S. units, especially those currently stationed in Japan. Moreover, the two governments are discussing mounting joint patrols elsewhere in the South China Sea, which also would draw the U.S. into any Japanese confrontation with China, including over claims of other nations which might be cooperating with Tokyo, such as the Philippines and Vietnam.



Abe’s historical revisionism further inflames regional tensions. It is difficult to assess what proportions are belief, tradition, and politics. Abe and other senior officials backed away from prior acceptance of Tokyo’s responsibility for starting the Pacific war and coercing women into military brothels. High profile visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, which memorializes several Class A convicted war criminals, inflame passions. Revised textbooks downplayed Japan’s World War II role and emphasized Japan’s current territorial claims.



None of this suggests that Tokyo is about to embark upon a new round of imperial conquests. But such incidents create suspicion and antagonize other nations, including South Korea, which should work closely with Japan to promote regional peace and stability. Abe addressed the historical controversy in his speech to Congress when he spoke of his “deep repentance in my heart” for American lives lost fighting in the Pacific in World War II and reaffirmed the apologies of prior Japanese premiers for their nation’s conduct. However, he should use the same tone in addressing his neighbors and his government should avoid new incidents.



There actually was much to celebrate in Prime Minister Abe’s visit. But a largely one‐​way military alliance is not one of them. Abe intended to highlight the changing bilateral alliance. Unfortunately, Washington and Tokyo only have reinforced the status quo. President Obama admitted: “it’s important to recognize we do not expect some instant and major transformation in terms of how Japan projects military power.” Worse, he obviously doesn’t expect Tokyo to take over more responsibility for defending its own interests. Alas, American policy almost guarantees that Japan will never devote lives and resources to its own defense commensurate with its interest in its own defense.



Indeed, U.S. officials appear to have forgotten the purpose of alliances—to help the country making the alliance. Abe was eloquent in stating why Japan enjoyed being allied with America. It isn’t evident what the U.S. receives in return. The problem is not just the administration. Representatives J. Randy Forbes and K. Michael Conaway, members of the Armed Services Committee, pushed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act “reiterating the United States’ commitment to Japan.” Why? No doubt, Washington defending Japan is good for Tokyo. But how does doing so benefit Americans who do the paying today and may do the dying tomorrow?



After World War II the U.S. sensibly shielded allied states from totalitarian assault as they recovered. That policy succeeded decades ago. Now Washington should cede responsibility for defending its populous and prosperous friends and allies. These nations still should cooperate, including on the “human security” issues emphasized by Abe. Moreover, America should remain a watchful and wary friend, prepared to act from afar against potentially hostile hegemonic threats. Beijing might eventually become one, but it is not close to being one today. In the meantime Washington should let other states manage day‐​to‐​day disputes and controversies in the region.



The U.S. should not tell Tokyo what to do. Japan’s defense and foreign policies belong to the Japanese. Nor should American officials attempt to micro‐​manage Tokyo’s responses to Chinese challenges in the Senkakus or elsewhere. Rather, Washington should explain what it will not do. No promise of war on Japan’s behalf, no forward military deployment, no guarantee for Japanese commerce at sea, no Pentagon backing for contested territorial claims.



This would force the Japanese people to debate their security needs, set priorities, and pay the cost. A great nation with global interests situated next to a potentially hostile revanchist state probably should spend more than one percent of GDP on the military. Moreover, Tokyo would have added incentive to improve its relationships with neighboring states. East Asia will more secure if weaker nations work together to constrain the PRC, and Japan already is forging useful ties with India, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Relations with South Korea require concerted effort to improve, something more likely if neither country can rely on America to backstop its security. In this way military necessity might be the most powerful impetus for Japan to downplay historical revisionism.



After 70 years the U.S. should stop playing globocop, especially in regions where powerful, democratic friends such as Japan can do so much more to defend themselves and their neighborhoods. This would be the best way to enhance security and stability not only of the Asia‐​Pacific, of which the prime minister spoke, but also of America, which is Washington’s highest responsibility.

"A new study has found that the government’s $4bn Murray-Darling irrigation efficiency program, designed to make farms more efficient while returning some of the saved water to the environment has actually led to irrigators who received subsidies extracting more water than those who did not. The study by academics from University of Adelaide, University of NSW, the Australian National University and the Environmental Defenders office found up to 28% more water was extracted by those who received subsidies. It also found that the subsidies went mainly to corporate farming and that 51% of irrigators themselves were sceptical about whether the programs were working. Their findings, published in the international journal, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, analysed almost 2,500 on-farm Murray-Darling Basin irrigation surveys and identified a “rebound effect” of increased water extractions, coinciding with the Australian government’s investment in irrigation infrastructure upgrades. Efficiency programs – such as installing drip irrigation or lining dams – are funded under the Murray Darling Basin plan as a way of reclaiming water for the environment. The water savings achieved by the upgrades are meant to be shared between the farmer and the environment, as a win-win. But this study argues that the schemes often amount to “robbing Peter to pay Paul” because they reduce flows into the environment that were occurring in the past through groundwater systems and are leading to greater water extractions by those who get the subsidies. The efficiency programs under the Murray Darling Basin plan have long been controversial because they cost roughly three times as much as buying back water directly from from farmers. But direct buybacks are highly contentious in rural communities because of their economic impact. Prof Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford School at ANU told a senate committee last year that the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers. Now this report casts doubt about whether they are actually retrieving water at all. “Combined with documented concerns around measurement of water and compliance, this raises serious doubts about the true extent to which environmental flows are increasing at a catchment and basin level, as a consequence of the subsidised upgrades,” the authors said. Lead author and resource economist Prof Sarah Wheeler from the University of Adelaide said: “Our analysis over the past decade found that irrigators who received infrastructure grants actually increased their water extraction volumes by 21 to 28%, compared to irrigators who received no subsidies.” The subsidies aim to help irrigators upgrade their infrastructure technology to save water and return some savings to the environment, in a bid to increase stream flows and ultimately reinstate a sustainable level of extraction in the Murray Darling Basin. Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW Sydney, said the implementation of some government programs seemed to have the opposite effect of what they had intended. “The ‘buyback’ of irrigation water has put water back into the rivers, but our research found the subsidised infrastructure program could be ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ by enabling more water extractions than water recovered through the efficiency program,” Kingsford said. The study also found that half of all irrigators surveyed agreed that the taxpayer-funded program for the irrigation infrastructure was ‘wasteful and inefficient’. The study found that the program favoured corporate agriculture, in terms of subsidy amount per entity more than family farms. The increase water extraction occurred because of changes in crop types, increases in irrigated areas and greater use of surface water entitlements [water that is captured on farm rather than being allowed to flow into the river system],” Grafton said. Environmental Defenders Office special counsel Emma Carmody said: “There are a range of regulatory and governance issues which could result in the increased taking of water from some rivers and aquifers in the MDB, beyond specified limits.” These include illegal extractions, increased floodplain harvesting, groundwater substitution and problems with ‘sustainable diversion limit’ compliance tools in some catchments. Kingsford warned that if water consumption is not being controlled as required by the basin plan, the health of rivers and groundwater systems in the Murray-Darling Basin will continue to degrade, without even accounting for the current and future threat of climate change."

Guest Post by David Middleton
I ran across a really funny story on Real Clear Energy last Friday…
Once you get past all of the nonsense about fracking polluting groundwater and global warming hysteria, the article really gets “interesting.”

Ten Reasons Why Fracking is isn’t Doomed
1. Scientists have found that solar photovoltaic cells could be producing electricity at less 50 cents a watt by 2016, four years earlier than other projections.
The source of reason #1 is this blog post…
Brave new world as solar PV heads to 50c/watt
By Giles Parkinson on 20 July 2012
US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu earlier this year suggested that solar PV without subsidies will be cheaper than both coal and gas if it could get its costs down to around $1/watt by the end of the decade – an event that would trigger a total re-examination of the way electricity was produced in the world’s largest economy.
[…]
The report includes a few notable graphs. The first is the cost path for module – now estimated at around 75c/W and heading down to 50c/W at a rate of knots. GTM, and most others in the industry, believe it will get to the 50c/W mark by 2016 at the latest, most likely 2015

[…]
http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/brav…-50cwatt-29404
The chart implies that solar PV power plants currently cost ~$1.45/W and will soon fall to ~$0.50/W. However, the chart only covers the CapEx for the solar modules. Even if the module costs are accurate, the CapEx for solar PV power plants currently ranges from $6-7/W ($6-7 million per MW), costing 6-7 times as much as and requiring 8 times as much land area per MW as a natural gas-fired plant.

Even if you factor in fuel,solar PV is still projected to cost 3 times as much per kWh as gas-fired electricity (combined cycle).

Even if the module costs did drop from $1.45 to $0.50 per Watt, that would only lower the full cost from $6-7 million per MW to $5-6 million per MW. Land isn’t free and construction isn’t done by volunteers.
2. Germany is on the verge of producing more solar energy than wind energy, the first major industrialized country to reach that milestone. Germany wants to produce 35 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020, only 8 years from now.
I didn’t think the second reason could be dumber than the first reason. I was wrong…


3. Researchers at UCLA have created a solar-power-generating window. If all those glass box skyscrapers in southern California could be put to work generating electricity, it would probably power the whole state.
Words escape me… Even if mythical solar windows could power the entire State…
How much would it cost per MW of installed capacity?
How would California keep the lights on when “the Sun don’t shine”?
4. The British government has given the go-ahead for two huge offshore wind farms off the coast of Norfolk (the eastern coast). Together, they will have the capacity to produce over a gigawatt of power (roughly one nuclear power plant’s worth). Britain is the leader in offshore wind energy generation.
“Over a gigawatt of power”! That’s just 1,000 MW and, as can be seen in the previously posted levelized generation cost chart, offshore wind is even more expensive than solar PV.
5. With Japan’s nuclear energy plants being phased out because of public fury over the Fukushima disaster, the country is trying to move quickly to renewables. It is placing a big bet on offshore floating wind platforms.
Maybe I’m missing something here… But I don’t see how Japan’s lack of cheap energy sources dooms fracking.
6. Scientists have concluded that it is perfectly practical to provide 2/3s of US electricity from solar over the next decades. The main problem is not electricity generation or having enough land to put the cells on, it is the poor electrical grid of the US, which will have to be redone.
Reason number 6 seems to be that there is enough surface area on the planet for solar PV (I wonder if there’s enough Windex on the planet). Good to know that there’s enough space. Since natural gas-fired plants take up 1/8 as much space per MW, “space” isn’t likely to doom fracking before it dooms solar PV.
7. Algeria wants to go solar, aiming for 650 megawatts of solar energy by 2015 and a massive 22 gigawatts by 2030. The Desertec Foundation has big projects in Egypt and Morocco, and Algeria, an oil producer, has decided to join in.
It’s been a bit more than a year since I ran the numbers on Desertec; but I doubt they’ve improved. The ultimate goal is 100 GW installed capacity (100,000 MW) at an estimated total cost of $550 billion (~$5.5 million per MW)… Only about 6 times as expensive as coal and natural gas and 2-3 times as expensive as nuclear and wind.
1 TW (Terrawatt) = 1 billion kW (Kilowatts)
At 15 cents per kWh, Desertec will generate an annual gross revenue of $105 billion if it really delivers 700 TWh per year. That’s enough to cover the construction cost principle (pay out) in 35-46 years (30-40 years to build and 5-6 years of operation).
If Desertec really had to compete with nuclear, natural gas and coal, it could only charge 3 to 7 cents per kWh. This would push “pay out” up to about 70 years.
In either case, it’s still an example of multinational mental deficiency.
On top of all of that. These solar arrays would be built across North Africa and the Middle East. I always thought one of selling points for solar was that it would make us less energy-dependent on regions like North Africa and the Middle East… 
8. Some 750,000 Australian homes have solar panels on the roof, heading toward 10% of the 8 million households in the sun-drenched country.
Not likely to doom fracking in the USA… We’re a bit less sun-drenched than Oz. And I doubt it will doom fracking in Oz either….
Australian LNG Exports to Triple
11 July 2012
National exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could more than triple to 63 million tonnes per annum by 2016-17 as Australia plays a greater role in satisfying global energy demand.
This is the forecast of the inaugural Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics (BREE) Gas Market Report released today by Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson AM MP.

9. China is going to make a major push for solar energy after 2015, aiming for a mind-bogging (Sic) 50 gigawatts worth by 2020.
I think the author may have meant “mind-boggling,” However, the author’s mind clearly is “bogged.” 50 GW would be less than 5% of China’s generation capacity.
China leads the world in the manufacturing and sales of solar PV cells, but they are in no hurry to build out solar PV infrastructure for themselves…

They manufacture solar cells to sell them to Germany.
China’s push to build 50 GW of solar PV won’t even doom fracking in China, much less in the USA…

Can China Follow U.S. Shift from Coal to Gas?
By ANDREW C. REVKIN
[…]
Second, several years ago, I heard that teams of Chinese engineers were spending months in Oklahoma to learn about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as a method for liberating gas and oil from previously untappable shale deposits. More recently, reports showed that China — which was once considered gas poor — now has estimated volumes greater than those of the United States (which are, as you know, enormous). This week China signaled that it may indeed be gearing up for an ambitious gas push. An article in China Daily, “Will China embrace a shale gas boom?,” essentially answers its headline question with a resounding yes.

Reason number 10: Blame Israel…
10. The Egyptian gas pipeline through the Sinai to Jordan and Israel has been blown up 15 times since the Jan. 25 revolution. Egyptians are angry that the government of deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak had sold the gas at substantially below-market prices to Israel. Because of the interruptions, Jordan’s government is more eager than ever to move to solar and wind power. A sign of increased international interest in the nascent Jordanian renewables sector is that a Chinese company wants to invest $200 million in a solar project. Jordan has a goal of getting 10% of its electricity from renewables by 2020, though that may be an ambitious timeline. If its government were smart, it would go all out and double that goal, and try to meet it.
I have no doubt that China is eager to sell solar cells to another gullible customer… In the meantime Israel is open for business to natural gas drilling…

Noble Energy has been operating in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Israel, since 1998. Our 47 percent interest in the Mari-B field, the first offshore natural gas production facility in Israel, is one of our core international assets. Production from Mari-B began in 2004 and sales volumes have increased as Israel’s natural gas infrastructure has developed. Additional pipeline construction and power plant conversion is contributing to the growing natural gas demand in Israel. Significant new exploration discoveries at Tamar and Dalit will help meet Israel’s energy needs and drive new uses for natural gas in the future.
In early 2010, the Company commenced drilling two additional development wells at Mari-B. Combined with additional compression work, these new wells will support near-term gas deliverability and serve as injection wells for storage in the future.
We have a 36 percent operated working interest at Tamar, with gross mean resources of 8.4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas. Tamar was the largest natural gas discovery in the world in 2009 and represents Noble Energy’s largest-ever exploration find. Initial expectations target first production from Tamar in 2012. Contracting for the sale of natural gas from Tamar is underway, and the Company has negotiated a number of multi-year letters of intent to deliver energy supply to customers. Project sanction at Tamar is expected in 2010.
In late 2009, we acquired additional 3D seismic over approximately 1,600 square miles in the region where we have identified a number of new prospects and leads on our significant acreage position offshore Israel and Cyprus. Based on the results of the seismic program, the Company has identified gross unrisked resource potential greater than 30 Tcf. Along with our partners, we are planning to spud Leviathan, a 16 Tcf gross prospect, in the fourth quarter 2010.

"Japan recently left the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and has now caught the first whale in its waters since resuming commercial whaling, 33 years after a global ban came into effect. As a non-member, Japan is no longer bound by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) – the rules that the IWC has used to manage whaling since 1946. The IWC’s moratorium on commercial whaling has broadly been a success – whale populations have increased where whaling was the primary threat. The humpback whale is one example of successful recovery, but species such as the northern right whale have never recovered from centuries of whaling and are in critically low numbers. Outrage and despair greeted Japan’s decision to relaunch commercial whaling in its waters, although the conservation status of many species may be unaffected. Still, Japan’s exit from the IWC is a worrying message to the international community at a time when collaboration on environmental issues is sorely needed. Japan introduced a proposal at the IWC in 2018 which would allow it to restart commercial whaling. This was voted down – the proposal that was approved in its place supported a shift in the commission’s goal towards banning all commercial whaling in perpetuity.  A permanent commercial whaling ban might sound like an ordinary step, but the IWC’s purpose since 1946 has been “the orderly development of the whaling industry”. The IWC has gradually pivoted to focus more on conservation and other threats to whales since then, but one of its founding goals was to support the whaling industry and the people it employed. As the whaling industry has declined and attitudes towards whales have changed around the world, the IWC has changed too. Japan meanwhile has always been clear it wants to resume commercial whaling and is leaving the IWC because the moratorium was only meant to be temporary and lifted when whale populations could support whaling. Japan isn’t the first country to leave the IWC because of frustration with its rules on commercial whaling. Iceland left in 1992 and rejoined in 2002 as a full member but with a reservation to the moratorium that allows it to commercially whale. Norway objected to the moratorium decision in 1982 and so kept its right to commercially whale while remaining a full IWC member.  For most whale species, the exit of Japan from the convention banning commercial whaling will have few consequences. Whale populations in the Southern Ocean are even likely to benefit as Japan will lose its special research permit for scientific whaling in the region by leaving the IWC. Japan mostly took Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) here, but this species is not considered endangered. It’s a different story for whales found within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). No longer bound by the IWC’s rules, Japan can harvest whales here under the right given by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea but the number and species it will decide to take hasn’t been announced. One vulnerable population living in Japan’s EEZ which may be affected are common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which are genetically distinct and possibly number fewer than 5,500. It’s worrying this population hasn’t shown the same robust recovery seen among other minke whales.  Japan will want to prove to the world it can whale sustainably but the long-term future of whaling is uncertain. The market for whale meat in Japan peaked after World War II and is now a shadow of its former self. Although still eaten in cultural ceremonies and a few localities in northern Honshu, consumption is around 40g per capita each year - about the size of a slice of ham. Whether Japan’s diminished appetite for whale meat will reduce its whaling efforts though remains to be seen. Research by the IWC scientific committee has greatly advanced our understanding of whale ecology and how to address other threats to their survival, like pollution, bycatch and climate change. Japan’s exit from the IWC doesn’t threaten the organisation’s activities and every effort should be made to continue this important research. But if the “International Whaling Commission” is to become a conservation organisation, then maybe its status as a whaling commission is outdated.  Countries could continue to work together on whale conservation by using the Convention on Migratory Species. This specifically targets the conservation of migratory species and their habitats, and would apply to protecting whales. In fact, there is already a regional agreement between countries that’s focused on whale conservation. Agreements made under this convention might be better able to deal with the diverse threats facing whales. A whale research programme focused on conservation – as opposed to a whaling research programme – made up of the IWC scientific committee and Japan might have fewer conflicts as their objective would be clearer. Japan’s exit from the IWC is a complicated issue beyond just whale conservation – it highlights the need for the international community to overcome disagreements. Asking why the IWC has succeeded and failed at different times can help us improve the way we work together on global challenges as after all, whaling is only one example of the many urgent and complex environmental issues that demand a global response. How well we work together determines more than just the fate of the world’s whales."

In case you missed it, on Sunday Dr. Roger Pielke Sr.wrote a statement of support for Watts et al 2012. See: Comments On The Game Changer New Paper “An Area And Distance Weighted Analysis Of The Impacts Of Station Exposure On The U.S. Historical Climatology Network Temperatures And Temperature Trends” By Watts Et Al 2012
Today he has written another essay, showing that Watts et al 2012 and another recent paper, McNider et al 2012 have shown
“…evidence of major systematic warm biases in the analysis of multi-decadal land surface temperature anomalies by NCDC, GISS, CRU and BEST.”
The Summary: 

One paper [Watts et al 2012] show that siting quality does matter. A warm bias results in the continental USA when poorly sited locations are used to construct a gridded analysis of land surface temperature anomalies.
The other paper [McNider et al 2012] (pdf here) shows that not only does the height at which minimum temperature observations are made matter, but even slight changes in vertical mixing (such as from adding a small shed near the observation site, even in an otherwise pristine location) can increase the measured temperature at the height of the observation. This can occur when there is little or no layer averaged warming.

"**Employers are cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs as Covid-19 continues to hit the economy.**
While many parts of the country went into lockdown to combat the spread of the virus, unemployment numbers have been rising sharply. How high could the unemployment rate go?
The most widely used measure is the unemployment rate. It counts how many people are able to work and want a job, but can't find one.
The most recent unemployment rate - for July to September - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
That is an increase of 0.7% over the previous three months, and meant that 1.62 million people were unemployed.
However, this number is always based on surveys taken in previous months and is not right up to date. Some of the data was gathered in July and August, when infection rates were falling, and large parts of the economy were reopening.
So this figure is likely to carry on rising in coming months.
Most economists expect unemployment to continue rising for the rest of the year.
UK unemployment is likely to reach 2.6 million in the middle of 2021, according to the government's economic watchdog, or 7.5% of the working age population. It's currently about 1.6 million.
This is echoed by the Bank of England, which forecasts that unemployment will most likely peak at about 7.7% in April to June of next year.
There was a high degree of uncertainty around that forecast, with a small chance that it could rise as high as 10%.
However, those forecasts don't take into account the government's decision to extend the furlough scheme to the end of March.
The government has been trying to protect jobs through a number of measures. The largest is the furlough scheme, where it pays most of the wages for workers when their employers cannot. That has prevented many of those people becoming unemployed.
However, the furlough scheme was being wound down in September and October, ahead of its planned closure on 31 October.
Many companies cut jobs in preparation for the end of the scheme, and July to September saw a record rise in the number of redundancies of 181,000.
The government has now announced an extension to the scheme for another five months, which it hopes will protect more jobs.
The easing of lockdown restrictions across the summer also boosted the numbers of people counted as unemployed.
People who weren't looking for a job during the first lockdown were considered ""economically inactive"", and weren't included in the figures. But as the rules changed, they began to look for work and were therefore classed as unemployed.
The figures for July to September saw a record number of people move from inactive to unemployed - 215,000.
One of the hardest-hit groups has been young people. The figures show that 174,000 fewer 16- to 24-year-olds were employed in July to September, compared to the previous three months.
The ONS says that this is because young people are more likely to be working in areas such as hotels, restaurants and tourism. Jobs like these have been particularly hard-hit by lockdown, and quarantine restrictions have reduced the number of tourists.
The latest official statistics capture the state of the country before a lockdown across all of England was announced, and the extension of the furlough scheme.
They do show a picture of many things improving, although that may not last.
The total number of hours people worked in July to September increased as parts of the economy reopened and people returned to work.
The average amount people earn had been falling sharply during the crisis, but it rose 1.9% in the latest figures (excluding bonuses).
The number of job vacancies available also continued to increase, but there are still 35% less than a year ago.
The start of the pandemic saw a big increase in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, which was much bigger than the rise in the number of people counted as unemployed.
In October 2020 the number of people claiming either Jobseeker's Allowance or universal credit because they were ""searching for work"" was 2.6 million, 1.4 million higher than March, before the pandemic had begun to take effect.
However, some of these people are working, but with low earnings either because they are on low wages or short hours.
The ONS says it cannot tell how many of those people are out of work, or whether they are now able to get universal credit because the rules for claiming it have changed."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an e-mail from an NTZ reader who brought a recent post at Skeptical Science to my attention. Normally I don’t read reality-denial, end-of-world theorist sites. But in this case I had to make an exception. In general, for once, it’s even worth reading.
=======================================================

Climate Bet for Charity, 2013 Update
Posted on 27 November 2013 by Rob Honeycutt
A couple of years ago I happened upon a German “climate contrarian” website called NoTricksZone run by Pierre Gosselin.  While reading through one particular post I made an off-hand comment that I’d never found a skeptic who would put their money where their mouth is related to climate.
Well, Pierre took that as a challenge and we got together to create a gentleman’s climate bet with proceeds going to a charity of the winner’s choice.  (Correction: As Tom points out in the commens the terms state, “…the charity organisation is yet to be chosen, but will (1) be one that both sides agree on, (2) help children in dire need (3) have low overhead and (4) be international.”) That was back in early 2011.  It became the Climate Bet for Charity, subtext: “Will  the next 2011-2020 decade be warmer than the previous 2001 – 2010 decade?”
Continue reading here.
Couple of notes. Rob Honeycutt writes:
I pulled up the UAH and RSS lower tropospheric anomalies through WoodForTrees.org and did the calculations myself.  Sure enough, the average of UAH and RSS for the 2001-2010 decade comes out at 0.226C.  The current 2011-present decade is running at 0.173C.  That’s 0.053C below the last decade, based on, yes, three years of data.  So, they actually do have this much correct.”
And even if the current decade ended up being slightly warmer, it would still mean CO2 sensitivity is seriously exaggerated.
Next Rob blames the start-point (which he agreed with from the beginning) for being one of the reasons they are behind in the bet. He also writes:
In fact, since we’re averaging so few data points in the early phase of the of the chart, it’s going to be mostly just noise.  It doesn’t tell us anything meaningful at all.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




I suppose if the data for the current decade were running warmer, you would not be hearing any “just noise” talk from Rob.
Rob then tries a few other statistical games before ultimately concluding that, under the bottom line, temperatures haven’t been rising like they were expected to.
Next Rob gives his opinion on who he feels is doing the better job measuring global temperature:
 I’m now of the personal opinion that GISS is likely the most accurate data set being that it has the greatest coverage for the Arctic, where we’re seeing the greatest warming.”
Arctic measurement has serious issues, as ED Caryl has just written at NTZ. I get the feeling he wishes he regrets agreeing to using RSS and UAH data to settle the bet. In the end, he does maintain a positive attitude, doing his best to exude confidence:
My own best guess is, barring a major low latitude volcanic event before 2020, there is a >95% chance that this decade will end up being warmer than the last. Physics is on our side.  You just can’t add 2.3Watts/m2 of man-made radiative forcing (source) to the climate system and believe the planet is not going to warm.
Strangely those theoretical 2.3 W/sqm and his brand of physics mysteriously have not produced any warming in 15 years….except, that is, “somewhere” in the depths of the oceans.
Finally, to support his theories of global warming physics, Rob writes:
Note that the decade of 1991-2000 was 0.139C warmer than 1981-1990, and the decade of 2001-2010 was 0.204C warmer than 1991-2000.”
Suddenly Rob completely forgets about the oceans. 🙂

"In 2015, flooding exposed the frozen bodies of two cave lion cubs in the Yakutia region of Russia. Members of a species that vanished at the end of the last Ice Age, the pair were buried approximately 12,000 years ago when the roof of their den collapsed and trapped them in the frozen ground. In photos, their faces are so well-preserved one might almost believe they are only sleeping. Yet despite their unusually perfect condition, the cubs are not the only such relics to have appeared in recent years. Throughout the Arctic and subarctic, animals and artefacts buried for thousands of years are reappearing, liberated from their frozen graves by the rapid warming in the region. In the Alps and elsewhere, bodies of people lost for decades in the mountains are emerging from the ice as glaciers melt. In Australia, towns submerged for generations are resurfacing as dam levels fall due to drought and heat.   As British author Robert Macfarlane has observed, these uncanny emergences or “Anthropocene unburials” are part of a larger process of unsettlement and unhinging. As human time and geological time collapse into one another, the deep past is erupting into the present all around us with terrifying and uncanny consequences. What was fixed is now in flux, what was settled is being swept away faster than we can save it. Nor is it just the past that has become unstable. The climate emergency is unsettling our future as well, erasing what we thought was certain, what we thought we knew. For many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia. Over weeks and months we watched helplessly as the conflagration consumed lives, livelihoods, even entire ecosystems, while images that seemed wrenched from a dystopian future flickered across our screens. In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world. Part of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story. A desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, Clade, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand. Faced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world? My new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn’t, or isn’t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago, complete with woolly mammoths. It seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to be such a being? As the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human. Along the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal. Yet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing. I began writing Ghost Species just after my father’s death. It will be published a few weeks after my mother’s. It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia’s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible. • Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton"
"Red wolves were one of the first carnivores Europeans encountered in North America. Unfortunately, this meant red wolves were also one of the first to be exterminated. Fuelled by fear and superstition, government supported eradication campaigns reduced red wolves to only about 100 individuals by mid-20th century.  In the 1970s, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) removed the last remaining red wolves from eastern Texas and western Louisiana to try to save them in captivity. Declared extinct in the wild in 1980, the USFWS has since focused conservation efforts on creating a captive population from which to restore red wolves to their historic range in the future.  Now, despite reestablishing a wild population, the USFWS Red Wolf Recovery Program is under review and could face closure. Removing red wolves from the wild was unprecedented and marked the first time a species was purposely removed from its natural environment to save it from extinction. The long-term objective to return them to the wild started with a small captive population and the Red Wolf Species Survival Plan that laid out a strategy for managing red wolf populations, establishing techniques for proper capture and restraint, coordinating research, and ultimately reintroducing captive-born red wolves to the wild. One problem was the red wolf’s close relation to the coyote: as red wolf populations tumbled, coyotes from western and central states moved into the wolf’s historic range, eventually colonising it entirely. The two species’ ranges did not historically overlap, but once in contact they can interbreed, meaning dwindling red wolf numbers were further reduced and assimilated into the coyote population via hybridisation. Starting with only 14 red wolves as founders, the captive population rose to about 60 after five years, during which time USFWS used several islands as preserves where some red wolves could be kept in semi-wild conditions and provide training opportunity for USFWS biologists. In 1987, the USFWS released four pairs of captive-born red wolves on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina. Since then the USFWS has established a wild population currently of about 80 individuals – the first successful reintroduction of its kind. Conservation and management of endangered carnivores is difficult, but restoring wolves to the eastern US is unprecedented as the effort requires addressing impacts by humans, hybridisation with coyotes, and inbreeding common to small endangered populations. The high number of wolves killed by humans exacerbates problems of inbreeding, which lowers the wolves’ fitness by decreasing reproductive rates and increasing susceptibility to environmental change and disease. Hybridisation increases when shrinking numbers allow coyotes to colonise territories of wolves killed by humans, and when a red wolf cannot locate a red wolf mate it will accept a coyote and produce hybrids. They may even do so to avoid inbreeding. To address hybridisation, USFWS developed a catch-and-release programme where coyotes are sterilised. These sterile coyotes then act as territorial placeholders; fitted with radio collars and monitored by USFWS biologists, they defend their territory against fertile coyotes until red wolves can move in and occupy those areas. This technique lowers coyote densities by suppressing reproduction, while also preventing hybrids in the event the sterile coyote finds a red wolf mate. Fortunately red wolves will readily adopt pups and raise them as their own, so captive-born red wolf pups are fostered into wild litters in order to increase the genetic diversity of the wild population. Not only does this technique decrease the relatedness of neighbouring wolves and augment the wild population, but it increases the survival of captive-born animals by allowing them be raised by wild red wolf packs. While the species’ recovery has benefited greatly from these techniques, the best solution to these problems is to simply increase the population size. Currently, about 80 red wolves in 15 packs hold territories across 6,500 km2 of public and private land. It’s essential to reduce the number of human-caused deaths and to boost red wolf population numbers. Despite great strides to restore red wolves to their former range, much work needs to be done, and an end to the USFWS Red Wolf Recovery Program could see the end of the red wolf."

For those celebrating Brexit as a way to push for freer markets, be aware that there is going to be a fight over this. This is from a _Financial Times_ piece arguing that the UK must ensure that its agriculture industry continues to receive subsidies:   




Some free market thinkers believe Britain’s departure from the CAP [the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy] is a golden opportunity to scale back — and even end — agricultural subsidies altogether. They believe the CAP has been hugely distortive because farmers are granted funds according to how much they produce. British farming businesses have therefore been unwilling to innovate, leaving agricultural productivity in the UK lagging well behind that of the US, for example.   
  
  
Proponents of deep cuts in subsidy also believe they are a _sine qua non_ if Britain is to forge new trade deals with non‐​EU states. The EU is so heavily committed to agricultural protectionism — imposing tariff barriers on outsiders while subsidising its own farmers — that its ability to sign trade agreements with developing nations has long been restricted. If the UK adopts a different approach, opening up its markets to food exports from, say, Commonwealth nations, it could gain significant new access for UK companies looking to sell services.   
  
  
Politicians should tread carefully, however. It is in Britain’s interest to maintain a strong farming industry at home and no government should take risks on food security. Farming is an uncertain profession and one that is increasingly exposed to the challenges posed by climate change. That is why most developed countries, whether inside the EU or not, maintain public funding for farming communities.   
  
  
The right course for Britain is to replace the CAP with a smarter and more innovative system of public support. Instead of subsiding food production, the UK should look to adopt a system of highly specific direct transfers. Future UK governments should, for example, put far more emphasis on paying farmers to tackle specific environmental problems; or to boost training and skills in the workplace; or to invest in research and development projects that boost productivity.



It’s amazing how much effort goes into finding new and “innovative” ways for governments to take taxpayer money and give it to the agriculture industry. No doubt there are better and worse ways to provide that money, and the EU Common Agricultural Policy could be improved, but Brexit offers an opportunity to go beyond the incremental changes suggested above for farm subsidies. That’s why the next few months and years are such an important time for the future of UK policy: There’s a chance to move strongly in the direction of free markets, in agriculture and other sectors. But this article makes clear that there will be people pushing back, and making questionable arguments about “food security,” so it’s important to engage now, while policies are still being decided.

George Avery is an assistant professor of public health at Purdue University. In today’s _Daily Caller_ , Avery rebuts claims that the Obama health plan would improve public health: 



The idea that health care contributes significantly to population health is both intuitively appealing and untrue.…   
  
  
In fact, federal “reform” often hurts the public health system. Both public health and health care experts have criticized Medicare and Medicaid, enacted by Congress in 1965, for changing the focus of health care practitioners from prevention to treatment.…   
  
  
Requiring all Americans purchase health insurance, which the current bills hope to do, would not address the underlying socio‐​economic issues at the root of most public health problems.…   
  
  
Indeed, access to health care can help individual patients, but can also aggravate some public health problems.… High rates of surgical intervention increase the risk and spread of drug resistant infections like MRSA.



Avery is the author of the Cato Institute briefing paper, “Scientific Misconduct: The Manipulation of Evidence for Political Advocacy in Health Care and Climate Policy.”

"**JD Sports has pulled out of talks over a rescue deal for department store chain Debenhams.**
It was the last remaining bidder for the firm, which is in administration, and up until the end of last week had been closing in on a deal.
But retail giant Arcadia is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams and its collapse is understood to have been a factor in JD Sports' decision.
Without a buyer, Debenhams could be wound down, risking thousands of jobs.
The company had already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has 12,000 workers.
The 242-year-old retailer had been considering a potential sale since the summer after it went into administration in April for the second time in a year.
The news that Arcadia has collapsed into administration, after the Covid-19 pandemic hit trading, has further complicated matters.
The downfall of the Arcadia group puts 13,000 jobs at risk. The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, currently has 9,294 employees on furlough.
Arcadia's brands, such as Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, are sold across Debenhams stores. They account for about Â£75m of sales.
Former Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire told the BBC he felt ""desperately sorry"" for the thousands of employees who were worried about their jobs.
He said that Debenhams had been ""caught in a straitjacket"" with too many High Street outlets on long leases.
""You've got to be so much faster and so much more online,"" he said, adding that the chain would have been better off with about 70 stores instead of the 130 it currently operates.
Shareholders in JD Sports had reacted badly to the news of the potential purchase of Debenhams, with the sports retailer seeing a sharp fall in its share price last week.
That rebounded on Monday after weekend reports claiming that it was reconsidering its move.
JD Sports was widely seen as the last chance to save the beleaguered British chain.
But in a short statement issued on Tuesday, JD Sports said that ""discussions with the administrators of Debenhams regarding a potential acquisition of the UK business have now been terminated"".
If a buyer is not found for Debenhams, the firm could go into liquidation, or face being wound down. During that process, buyers would be sought for its shops and the business's other assets, like stock.
Hilco Capital, a firm that specialises in winding up struggling retailers, was appointed by Debenhams in August to draw up contingency plans.
Debenhams said at the time that it was ""trading strongly"", despite having issued a string of profit warnings even before the pandemic hit.
In recent years several big High Street names have struggled including Thomas Cook, Mothercare and Bonmarche as retailers try to adapt to the rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits.

"This year is on course to be the world’s hottest since measurements began, according to meteorologists, who estimate there is a 50% to 75% chance that 2020 will break the record set four years ago. Although the coronavirus lockdown has temporarily cleared the skies, it has done nothing to cool the climate, which needs deeper, longer-term measures, the scientists say.  Heat records have been broken from the Antarctic to Greenland since January, which has surprised many scientists because this is not an El Niño year, the phenomenon usually associated with high temperatures. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates there is a 75% chance that 2020 will be the hottest year since measurements began. The US agency said trends were closely tracking the current record of 2016, when temperatures soared early in the year due to an unusually intense El Niño and then came down. The US agency said there was a 99.9% likelihood that 2020 will be one of the top five years for temperatures on record. A separate calculation by Gavin Schmidt, the director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, found a 60% chance this year will set a record. The Met Office is more cautious, estimating a 50% likelihood that 2020 will set a new record, though the UK institution says this year will extend the run of warm years since 2015, which is the hottest period on record. Abnormal weather is increasingly the norm as temperature records fall year after year, and month after month. This January was the hottest on record, leaving many Arctic nations without snow in their capital cities. In February, a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq, in Greenland, set an April record of 6C on Sunday. In the first quarter, the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia, where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks, large parts of the US have sweltered. Last Friday, downtown Los Angeles hit an April high of 34C, according to the National Weather Service. Western Australia has also experienced record heat. In the UK, the trend is less pronounced. The daily maximum UK temperature for April so far is 3.1C above average, with records set in Cornwall, Dyfed and Gwynedd. Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, said global warming was nudging closer to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. He said his online tracker showed a relatively conservative level of 1.14C of warming due to gaps in the data, but that this could rise to 1.17C or higher once the latest figures were incorporated. Although the pandemic has at least temporarily reduced the amount of new emissions, he said the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains a huge concern. “The climate crisis continues unabated,” Haustein said. “The emissions will go down this year, but the concentrations keep on rising. We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels. But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives, taxes, carbon prices etc).” This was echoed by Grahame Madge, a climate spokesman for the Met Office: “A reliance and trust in science to inform action from governments and society to solve a global emergency are exactly the measures needed to seed in plans to solve the next crisis facing mankind: climate change.”"

One of the most memorable characters in Michael Crichton’s climate-thriller _State of Fear_ is the pompous, egotistical actor-activist Ted Bradley. Bradley, who serves as both the avatar of Hollywood’s ignorant self-importance and as a foil for the book’s skeptic-heroes, comes to a hilariously bad end. As the crew are held captive by cannibals in New Guinea, Bradley insists that their peaceful village life is the acme of human contentment. He keeps insisting it, right up till the moment they club him over the head and butcher him.



But Ted Bradley’s fictional ignorance is as nothing compared to the dangerously blind foolishness of Western Pollyannas who insist that the world’s shitholes are just, like, misunderstood. Then come a cropper when they travel there to prove it.



Two Australians detained in a notorious Tehran prison have been identified as travel bloggers from Perth who were reportedly arrested for flying a drone without a licence.



Jolie King and Mark Firkin have been globetrotting since June 2017, and documenting their travels on Instagram and Youtube.



They started their blog to “inspire anyone wanting to travel, and also try to break the stigma around travelling to countries which get a bad rap in the media”.



At least they’ve got off lightly, compared to poor [Pippa Bracca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Bacca). The Italian feminist and artist set off to hitch-hike through the Middle East in a wedding dress, “to give a message of peace and of trust”. Her naked, strangled and decomposing body was later found hidden in bushes near Istanbul.



Ms King was told by the Iranian authorities that she was being detained in hope of a prisoner swap, a source told The Times…Most recently the couple had posted videos of themselves driving the Karakoram Highway in Pakistan.



…“We’ll be blogging the whole trip on YouTube, documenting through pics and blogs on here, Facey and our website,” they wrote on an Instagram post in April.



Will they be posting Instagram pics of the prison food, a breathless world wonders? How many stars will their Yelp review give Iran’s secret police?



A female academic who holds Australian and British citizenship is also being detained and has ­reportedly been sentenced to 10 years in prison for an unspecified offence.



Another woman, dual Australian-Iranian citizen and Melbourne University demographer Meimanat Hosseini-Chavoshi, was arrested in Iran in December, charged with trying to “infiltrate” Iranian institutions.



Gosh, it’s almost like these idiot bloggers should have known that Iran gets a “bad rap” for a reason.



The Australian government even has a whole website for this stuff:



Reconsider your need to travel to Iran due to the risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested. Dual nationals are also at risk. We can’t guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you’re detained or arrested.

"**Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third over lockdown, according to a major study.**
Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements - but, despite this progress, cases remained relatively high across England.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the data showed the country could not ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"".
The findings by Imperial College London were based on swabbing more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The React-1 study is highly respected and gives us the most up-to-date picture of Covid-19 in the country.
Its researchers estimated the virus's reproduction (R) rate had fallen to 0.88. That means on average every infection translated to less than one other new infection, so the epidemic is shrinking.
Run alongside pollster Ipsos MORI, the Imperial study involved testing a random sample of people for coronavirus, whether or not they had symptoms.
The results of these tests suggested a 30% fall in infections between the last study and the period of 13-24 November.
Before that, cases were accelerating - doubling every nine days when the study last reported at the end of October.
Now cases are coming down, but more slowly than they shot up - halving roughly every 37 days.
In the North West and North East, though - regions with some of the highest numbers of cases - infections fell by more than half.
The findings suggest cases are now highest in the East Midlands and West Midlands.
Lockdown came into force across England on 5 November but national data, based on people with symptoms, suggests there was a spike in cases in the week after.
This was put down to pre-lockdown socialising, since it takes five days on average after catching the infection for it to be detectable by a test.
Despite clear improvements, overall cases remain high.
An estimated one in 100 people have coronavirus - double the rate in September when infections began to rise.
The study also found certain groups had a higher chance of testing positive over this period:
It estimated that:
Prof Paul Elliott, who leads the study, said the data offered ""encouraging signs"" for England's epidemic.
""These trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in [the worst-affected areas] and that lockdown has added to this effect.
But he said: ""As we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay.""
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to continue to pay attention to public-health messaging, as cases remained high.
""It's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control,"" he added.
Prof Kevin McConway, a statistics professor at the Open University, urged caution over the figures.
He said: ""Things have started moving in the right direction again, but we're by no means in the position we were at the end of the summer, or even the start of the summer. We can't stop taking great care yet by any means.""
The government suggested England's new tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, would be ""crucial"" to keeping infections falling.
The three-tier system is tougher than the similar one in place before 5 November, under which cases continued to rise.
It will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
These findings of the React-1 study are interim, meaning they still need to be reviewed.

By Jim Goodridge  – former California State Climatologist
Photosynthesis simply stated is 6CO2 + 6H2O + photons = C6H12O6+6O2.
It is suggested by the relative abundances of atmospheric CO2 and O2,
That CO2 is a quite active material and it is always in short supply.
Plant growth is basically the chemical reaction of storing solar energy.
Chemical reactions generally double with an increase of 10°F.
Rising temperatures cause CO2 to boil out of ocean water.

Rising temperature and CO2 concentration both stimulate plant growth.
Our atmosphere originally contained about 30 percent CO2.
The era of chlorophyll dominance is referred to as the Great Oxidation.
This happened 2.5 billion years ago. The ocean’s dissolved iron.
Rusted out, producing our planets iron ore deposits and releasing oxygen.
Chlorophyll is still the mechanism controlling the CO2 and O2 abundance.
All life forms basically originated by a photosynthesis process.
Chemically our hemoglobin and chlorophyll are quite similar.
Suggesting a common origin, that is supported by common DNA code.
Where as animals do not photosynthesize, their plant foods do.
Beef, chicken or fish feed off photosynthetic products.
It is mainly trace minerals that supplement photo-source.
CO2 is literally the gas of life for all macro life forms we encounter.
The existence of extremophiles suggests very early non-solar energy sources.
Demonizing CO2 started with the plan for peaceful use of atomic bombs.
The big dream in 1946 that was that atomic energy would be so cheap,
That electricity would never again need to be metered.
The attribution of increased CO2 to fossil fuel burning was born here.
Atomic energy advocates wanted to save Earth from runaway GH heating like Venus.
A conservation ethic developed to conserve the finite petroleum for the future and
Anti-pollution and anti-growth advocates added voices to the anti- CO2 theme.
All earthly macro life forms are photosynthically derived from CO2,
Either directly or indirectly by chlorophyll that absorbs solar photons.
We are not here not at the whim of a deity but by evolution of CO2 derivatives.
================================================================
Note: Jim’s line, The attribution of increased CO2 to fossil fuel burning was born here. 
There’s a tremendous backstory to this which I have been chasing for awhile. See this post from the earlier days of WUWT in 2008. If anyone can help find it, I’d be appreciative.

UPDATE: The paper itself is available below.
There is a new  paper published yesterday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters from NASA GISS/Columbia University and Brown University titled  Hydroclimate of the northeastern United States is highly sensitive to solar forcing
Key Points

Holocene northeast US hydrological change is consistent with solar forcing
Small changes in solar forcing are amplified in our region by Arctic Oscillation
Leaf-wax abundances in peatlands provide high-resolution climate information

This paper looks at hydrogen isotope proxy records over the past 6800 years and finds that the hydroclimate of the Northeastern U.S. is “highly sensitive” to solar activity.

The abstract of the paper says:
“The Sun may be entering a weak phase, analogous to the Maunder minimum, which could lead to more frequent flooding in the northeastern US at this multidecadal timescale.”
It is interesting to see this solar-hydro relationship defined in the USA. Previous similar works include defining a solar-hyrdo relationship to Nile River flow in Africa.
Here’s the paper and abstract: 
GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 39, L04707, 5 PP., 2012

Hydroclimate of the northeastern United States is highly sensitive to solar forcing

Dramatic hydrological fluctuations strongly impact human society, but the driving mechanisms for these changes are unclear. One suggested driver is solar variability, but supporting paleoclimate evidence is lacking. Therefore, long, continuous, high-resolution records from strategic locations are crucial for resolving the scientific debate regarding sensitivity of climate to solar forcing. We present a 6800–year, decadally-resolved biomarker and multidecadally-resolved hydrogen isotope record of hydroclimate from a coastal Maine peatland, The Great Heath (TGH). Regional moisture balance responds strongly and consistently to solar forcing at centennial to millennial timescales, with solar minima concurrent with wet conditions. We propose that the Arctic/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) can amplify small solar fluctuations, producing the reconstructed hydrological variations. The Sun may be entering a weak phase, analogous to the Maunder minimum, which could lead to more frequent flooding in the northeastern US at this multidecadal timescale.

"**Boris Johnson has agreed to publish the health, economic and social data behind England's new tier system later, as he seeks to avert a Commons rebellion.**
MPs will vote on the measures on Tuesday, and numerous Conservative MPs have demanded to see the evidence government is basing its new system on.
Writing to a group of around 70 MPs - who are sceptical of the new rules - Mr Johnson called for ""unity and resolve"".
Labour is expected to support the PM, but is yet to confirm its stance.
If Labour does decide to get behind the new tier system, the government should easily win the vote - even if there is a sizeable revolt among Conservative MPs.
The information is expected to include data first published by the Office for Budget Responsibility last week.
England's new system - due to replace the national lockdown when it expires on Wednesday - will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
Nearly all of England will be in the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
The PM's letter to Tories from the Covid Recovery Group is his second letter to colleagues over the weekend, as he seeks to reassure them about the measures.
In an earlier letter to all MPs and peers, the prime minister said the rules in some areas could be eased in December, MPs could vote again on the measures in January, and the tier system could end on 3 February.
But some Conservative MPs have complained their constituencies are entering one of the tougher tiers, despite cases in their areas falling, and asked to see the data behind the measures.
The contents of one document could determine the size of Tuesday's Conservative revolt.
The government has conceded a key demand of the rebels - to produce an assessment of the economic and social impact of the restrictions.
Put very crudely, MPs want to know if the lives these tiers will save will outweigh livelihoods that will be lost.
Privately, some other potential rebels are indicating they are prepared to be convinced by the government's arguments.
And Mr Johnson's efforts to win over his sceptics seem to be making some headway.
The former minister Conor Burns - an old ally of Mr Johnson's - had been critical of how the government intended to impose its restrictions.
But he told the Westminster Hour he won't be voting against them, saying: ""We've got the vaccine coming over the horizon. If the government really feels we need to do this then I'm probably prepared to swallow hard and support them.""
But some other potential rebels have told the BBC that they are withholding their support unless and until they see the hard data behind the PM's decisions.
In his letter to the Covid Recovery Group, Mr Johnson said he'd ""responded positively"" to their ""constructive proposals"". The next 24 hours will see him continue the campaign of persuasion with his own backbenchers.
Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said he was ""particularly concerned about some of the non-Covid health implications these restrictions have been having"".
And he urged the government to publish details of what extra support would be made available, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of the new tier system before Tuesday's vote.
Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to increase the grants given to businesses. He said the hospitality sector in his region is ""facing crisis"".
Speaking during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturers in Wales, Mr Johnson said he understood people's ""frustrations"" particularly those in the hospitality sector.
He said the best thing for the industry would be to ""keep the virus under control, use mass testing, roll that out in ever greater numbers, plus the vaccine if, as I hope, we can start to distribute them.""
In his letter to MPs, the PM also said the government would:
Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice acknowledged a large number of Conservative MPs were ""unsettled"" and said the prime minister would be ""working very hard"" to reassure those MPs that he doesn't want to ""maintain the measures for a moment longer than is necessary"".
He added he would be surprised if Labour voted against the steps, adding ""it is not the moment for any party to play politics.""
Speaking at a virtual town hall with residents from Lancaster and Morecambe, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""need for restrictions"" and that the Labour Party ""has to act in the national interest"".
He expressed concerned that the government ""doesn't have the support package right"" and said people in the North West ""are tearing their hair out saying ""we've been in restrictions for months and need better support.'""
Sir Keir and other members of the shadow cabinet are due to meet England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance later, as they decide whether to vote with the government.
However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns.
The party is urging the government to release the evidence underpinning the new system; commit to involving local authorities; and offer urgent support to pubs.
Meanwhile, a major study from Imperial College London has found that coronavirus infections in England fell by about a third over lockdown.
Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, but cases still remained high across England.
Researchers estimated that the virus's reproduction (R) rate had fallen to 0.88, meaning the epidemic is shrinking.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases which will come into force from 18:00 GMT on Friday.
On Sunday, a further 12,155 positive coronavirus test results were recorded across the UK, bringing the total to 1,617,327.
A further 215 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded, bringing the total to 58,245."

Abstract
The traditional estimate of temperature at measuring stations has been to average the highest (Tmax) and lowest (Tmin) daily measurements. This leads to error in estimating the true mean temperature. What is the magnitude of this error and how does it depend on geographic and climatic variables? The US Climate Reference Network (USCRN) of temperature measuring stations is employed to estimate the error for each station in the network. The 10th-90th percentile range of the errors extends from -0.5 to +0.5 C. Latitude and relative humidity (RH) are found to exert the largest influences on the error, explaining about 28% of the variance. A majority of stations have a consistent under- or over-estimate during all four seasons. The station behavior is also consistent across the years.
Introduction 
Historically, temperature measurements used to estimate climate change have depended on thermometers that record the maximum and minimum temperatures over a day. The average of these two measurements, which we will call Tminmax, has been used to estimate a mean daily temperature. However, this simple approach will have some error in estimating the true mean (Tmean) temperature. What is the magnitude of this error? How does it vary by season, elevation, latitude or longitude, and other parameters? For a given station, is it random or consistently biased in one direction?

Multiple studies have considered this question. Many of these are found in food and agriculture journals, since a correct mean temperature is crucial for predicting ripening of crops. For example, Ma and Guttorp (2012) report that Swedish researchers have been using a linear combination of five measurements (daily minimum, daily maximum, and measurements taken at 6, 12, and 18 hours UTC) since 1916 (Ekholm 1916) although revised later (Moden, 1939; Nordli et al, 1996). Tuomenvirta (2000) calculated the historical variation (1890-1995) of Tmean – Tminmax differences for three groups of Scandinavian and northern stations. For the continental stations (Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark) average differences across all stations were small (+0.1 to +0.2 oC) beginning in 1890 and dropping close to 0 from about 1930 on. However, for two groups of mainly coastal stations in the Norwegian islands and West Greenland, they found strongly negative differences (-0.6 oC) in 1890, falling close to zero from 1965 on. Other studies have considered different ways to determine Tmean from Tmin, Tmax and ancillary measurements (Weiss and Hays, 2005; Reoicovsky et al., 1989; McMaster et al., 1983; Misra et al., 2012). Still other studies have considered Tmin and Tmax in global climate models (GCMs) (Thrasher et al, 2012; Lobell et al., 2007).
This short note examines these questions using the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN), a network of high-quality temperature measurement stations operated by NOAA and begun around 2000 with a single station, reaching a total of about 114 stations in the continental US (44 states) by 2008. There are also 4 stations in Alaska, 2 in Hawaii, and one in Canada meeting the USCRN criteria. Four more stations in Alaska have been established, bringing the total to 125 stations, but have only 2-3 years of data at this writing. A regional (USRCRN) network of 17 stations has also been established in Alabama and has about 4 years of data. All these 142 stations were used in the following analysis, although at times the 121- or 125-station dataset was used. The stations are located in fairly pristine areas meeting all criteria for weather stations. Temperature measurements are taken in triplicate, and other measures at all stations include precipitation and solar radiance. Measurements of relative humidity (RH) were instituted in 2007 at two stations and by about 2009 were being collected at the 125 sites in the USCRN network but not at the Alabama (USRCRN) network. A database of all measurements is publically available at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/products/. The database includes hourly, daily, and monthly results. This database, together with single compilations of multiple files kindly supplied by NOAA, was used for the following analysis.
Methods
The monthly data for the 142 stations were downloaded one station at a time and joined together in a single database. (Note: at present, the monthly data are only available to the public as separate files for each station. Daily data are available as separate files for each year for each station. This requires 142 separate downloads for the monthly data, and about 500 or so downloads for the daily data. Fortunately, a NOAA database manager was able to provide the daily data as a single file of about 373,000 records.)
The hourly data include the maximum and minimum 5-minute average temperatures recorded each hour as well as the mean temperature averaged over the hour. The daily data include the highest 5-minute maximum and the lowest 5-minute minimum temperatures recorded in the hourly data that day (i.e. Tmax and Tmin) together with the mean daily temperature (Tmean). The average of Tmax and Tmin ({Tmax+Tmin}/2) is also included for comparison with the true mean. The monthly data includes the maximum and minimum temperatures for the month; these are averages of the observed highest 5-minute average maximum and minimum daily temperatures. There is also an estimate of the true mean monthly temperature and the monthly average temperature using the monthly Tmax and Tmin. The difference between the daily Tminmax and the true mean will be referred to as Delta T:
DeltaT = (Tmin+Tmax)/2 – Truemean
Data were analyzed using Excel 2010 and Statistica v11. For each station, the entire length of the station’s history was used; the number of months ranged from 47 to 132. Since the relationship between the true mean and Tminmax may vary over time, these were compared by season, where Winter corresponds to January through March and so on. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) was calculated for each day as Tmax-Tmin. For the two stations with the highest and lowest overall error, the hourly data were downloaded to investigate the diurnal pattern.
Results
As of Aug 11, 2012 there were 12,305 station-months and 373,975 station-days from 142 stations. The metadata for all stations are available at the Website http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/docs.html.
Delta T averaged over all daily measurements for each station ranged from -0.66 oC (Lewistowne, MT) to +1.38 oC (Fallbrook, CA, near San Diego). (Figure 1). A negative sign means the minmax approach underestimated the true mean. Just about as many stations overestimated (58) as underestimated (63) the true mean.

Figure 1. DeltaT for 121 USCRN stations: 2000-August 5, 2012. Error bars are standard errors.
A histogram of these results is provided (Figure 2). The mean was 0.0 with an interquartile range of -0.2 to +0.2 oC. The 10-90 percentile range was from -0.5 to + 0.5 oC.

Figure 2. Histogram of Delta T for 121 USCRN stations.
Seasonal variability was surprisingly low: in more than half of the 121 stations with at least 47 months of complete data, the Tminmax either underestimated (28 sites) or overestimated (39 sites) the true mean in all 4 seasons. Most of the remaining stations were also weighted in one direction or another; only 20 stations (16.5%) were evenly balanced at 2 seasons in each direction. 16 of these 20 were negative in winter and spring, positive in summer and fall. Over all 121 stations, there was a slight tendency for underestimates to be favored in winter and spring, with overestimates in summer and fall (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Variation of Delta T by season.
Since Delta T was determined by averaging all values over all years for each station, the possibility remains that stations may have varied across the years. This was tested by comparing the average Delta T for each station across the years 2008-9 against the average in 2010-11. The result showed that the stations were very stable across the years, with a Spearman correlation of 0.974 (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Comparison of Delta T for each station across consecutive 2-year periods. N = 140 stations.
When Delta T is mapped, some quite clear patterns emerge (Figure 5). Overestimates (blue dots) are strongly clustered in the South and along the entire Pacific Coast from Sitka, Alaska to San Diego, also including Hawaii. Underestimates (red dots) are located along the extreme northern tier of states from Maine to Washington (excepting the two Washington stations west of the Cascades) and all noncoastal stations west of Colorado’s eastern border.

Figure 5. DeltaT at 121 USCRN stations. Colors are quartiles. Red: -0.66 to -0.17 C. Gold: -0.17 to 0 C. Green: 0 to +0.25 C. Blue: +0.25 to +1.39 C.
Figure 5 suggests that the error has a latitude gradient, decreasing from positive to negative as one goes North. Indeed a regression shows a highly significant (p<0.000002) negative coefficient of –0.018 oC per degree of latitude (Table 1, Figure 6). However, other variables clearly affect DeltaT as shown by the adjusted R2 value indicating that latitude explains only 21% of the observed variance.

Figure 6. Regression of DeltaT on Latitude.
Therefore a multiple regression was carried out on the measured variables within the monthly datafile. The Spearman correlations of these variables with DeltaT are provided in Table 2. The largest absolute value of the Spearman coefficient was with latitude (-0.375), but other relatively high correlations were noted for Tmin (0.308) and RHmax (0.301). However, TMIN, TMAX, TRUEMEAN and DTR could not be included in the multiple regression, since they (or their constituent variables in the case of DTR) appear on the left-hand side as part of the definition of DELTAT. Also the three RH variables were highly collinear, so only RHMEAN was included in the multiple regression. Finally, because Alaska and Hawaii have such extreme latitude and longitude values, they were omitted from the multiple regression. These actions left 3289 station-months (out of 3499 total) and 6 measured independent variables, of which 4 were significant. Together they explained about 30% of the measured variance (Table 3, Figure 7). However, only latitude and RH were the main explanatory variables, explaining 28% of the variance themselves with about equal contributions as judged from the t-values. When the multiple regression was repeated for each season, in fall and winter the four significant and two nonsignificant variables were identical to those in the annual regression, with adjusted R2 values of 19-20%, but in spring and summer all six variables were significant, with R2 values of 47-50%. However, in all seasons, the two dominant variables were latitude and RH.

Since RH had a strong effect on DeltaT, a map of RH was made for comparison with the DeltaT map above (Figure 8). The map again shows the clustering noted for DeltaT along the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, and the West. However, the effect of latitude along the northern tier is missing from the RH map.

Fundamentally, the difference between the minmax approach and the true mean is a function of diurnal variation—stations where the temperature spends more time closer to the minimum than the maximum will have their mean temperatures overestimated by the minmax method, and vice versa. To show this graphically, the mean diurnal variation over all seasons and years is shown for the station with the largest overestimate (Fallbrook, CA) and the one with the largest underestimate (Lewistowne, MT) (Figure 9). Although both graphs have a minimum at 6 AM and a maximum at about 2 PM, the Lewistown (lower) diurnal curve is broader. For example, 8 hours are within 2 oC of the Lewistowne maximum, whereas only about 6 hours are within 2 oC of the Fallbrook maximum. Another indicator is that 12 hours are greater than the true mean in Lewistowne but only 9 in Fallbrook.

Discussion
For a majority of US and global stations, at least until recent times, it is not possible to investigate the question of the error involved in using the Tminmax method, since insufficient measurements were made to determine the true mean. The USCRN provides one of the best datasets to investigate this question, not only since both the true mean temperatures and the daily Tmax and Tmin are provided, but also because the quality of the stations is high. Since there are >100 stations well distributed across the nation, which now have at least 4 years of continuous data, the database seems adequate for this use and the results comparing 2-year averages suggest the findings are robust.
The questions asked in the Introduction to this paper can now be answered, at least in a preliminary way.
“What is the magnitude of this error?” We see the range is from -0.66 oC to +1.38 oC, although the latter value appears to be unusual, with the second highest value only +0.88 oC.
“How does it vary by season, elevation, latitude or longitude, and other parameters?” The direction of the error is surprisingly unaffected by season, with more than half the stations showing consistent under- or over-estimates during all 4 seasons. We have seen a strong effect of latitude and RH, with a weaker effect of elevation. Geographic considerations are clearly important, with coastal and Southern sites showing strong overestimates while the northern and western stations mostly show strong underestimates of the minmax method. Although the Tuomenvirta (2000) results mentioned above are averages across all stations in a region, still their findings that the coastal stations in west Greenland and the Norwegian islands showed a strong delta T in the same direction as the coastal stations in the USCRN supports the influence of RH, whereas their finding of the opposite sign for the continental stations shows the same dependence we find here for the Western interior USCRN stations. (Note that their definition of delta T has the opposite sign from ours.)
“For a given station, is it random or biased in a consistent direction?” For most stations, the direction and magnitude of the error is very consistent across time, as shown by the comparison across seasons and across years.
Considering the larger number of stations in the US and in historical time, we may speculate that the error in the minmax method was at least as large as indicated here, and most probably somewhat larger, since many stations have been shown to be poorly sited (Fall et al, 2011). The tendency in the USCRN dataset to have about equal numbers of underestimates as overestimates is simply accidental, reflecting the particular mix of coastal, noncoastal, Northern and Southern sites. It may be that this applies as well to the larger number of sites in the continental US, but there is likely to be a bias in one direction or another in different countries, depending on their latitude extent and RH levels.
This error could affect spatial averaging. For example, the Fallbrook CA site with the highest positive DeltaT value of 1.39 C is just 147 miles away from the Yuma site with one of the largest negative values of -0.58. If these two stations were reading the identical true mean temperature, they would appear to disagree by nearly 2 full degrees Celsius using the standard minmax method. Quite a few similar pairs of close-lying stations with opposite directions of DeltaT can be seen in the map (check for nearby red and blue pairs). However, if only anomalies were considered, the error in absolute temperature levels might not affect estimates of spatial correlation (Menne and Williams, 2008).
Although the errors documented here are true errors (that is, they cannot be adjusted by time of observation or other adjustments), nonetheless it would not be expected that they have much of a direct effect on trends. After all, if one station is consistently overestimated across the years, it will have the same trend as if the values were replaced by the true values. Or if it varies cyclically by season, again after sufficient time the variations would tend to cancel and the trend be mostly unaffected. Of course, this cannot be checked with the USCRN database since it covers at most 4-5 years with the full complement of stations, and normal year-to-year “weather” variations would likely overwhelm any climatic trends over such a short period.

APPENDIX
The main concern of this paper has been with Delta T and therefore almost all of the above analyses deal with that variable. However, another variable depending on the daily Tmax and Tmin is their difference, the Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR), which has its own interest. For example, the main finding of Fall et al., (2011) was that the poorly sited stations tended to overestimate Tmin and underestimate Tmax, leading to a large underestimate of DTR. However, the USCRN stations are all well-sited and therefore the estimates of DTR should be unbiased. What can we learn from the USCRN about this variable? We can first of all map its variation (Figure A-1).

Figure A-1. Variation of daily DTR across the US CRN. Colors are quartiles. Red: 4.7-10.8 C. Gold: 10.8-12.0 C. Green: 12.0-13.8 C. Blue: 13.8-19.9 C. 
Here we see that the coastal sites have the lowest daily variation, reflecting the well-known moderating effect of the oceans. Perhaps the two sites near the Great Lakes in the lowest quartile of the DTR distribution are also due to this lake effect. The Western interior states have the highest DTRs.
A multiple regression shows that RH is by far the strongest explanatory variable (Table A-1). Solar radiation and precipitation have moderate effects, and latitude is weakly significant. The model explains about 46% of the variance, with RHMEAN accounting for most (42%) of that (Figure A-2).

Figure A-2. Diurnal Temperature Range vs. mean RH.
The figure suggests that a linear fit is not very good; for RH between about 60-95% the effect on DTR (eyeball estimate) is perhaps twice the slope of -0.138 C per % RH for all the data..
Finally, how does the true mean temperature depend on the variables measured at the UCRN sites? The multiple regression is provided in Table A-2. Although all six variables are significant and explain about 79% of the variance, the relationship is largely driven (R2=59%) by solar radiation (Figure A-3).

Nicolas Garcia Belmonte has visualized wind motion in the USA, which I think is quite neat. On his weblog he writes:
I’ve been working on a WebGL data visualization of wind motion patterns for a 72 hour period in the United States.

Gathering the data from the National Weather Service was pretty interesting, I didn’t know USA had so many weather stations! 
The visualization shows wind direction encoded in line angles, wind speed encoded in line lengths and disk radius, and temperature encoded in hue. All this for about 1200 weather stations across the country.
You can switch between different visual markers from the top menu, also play the wind motion for the 72 hours or select a specific time from the timeline below the graphic.

This month President Trump visited Detroit to announce that his administration would revisit the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations that require vehicles to attain an average minimum gas mileage. The Obama administration had agreed to increase those standards by 2025 to 60 miles per gallon for small cars and 46 for large cars, and 50 for small trucks and 30 for large trucks.



Why are such requirements necessary? CAFE supporters claim that consumers don’t fully appreciate the value of good gas mileage. Specifically consumers are not willing to pay more initially for a vehicle that gets better gas mileage and has lower operating costs over the lifetime of the vehicle. Thus the government must mandate the production of more efficient vehicles.



Are consumers myopic? Clemson University economist Molly Espey examined sales price data for 2001 model year cars and found that consumers paid _more_ than the fuel savings for different cars that, apart from gas mileage, were comparable. In another paper, a team of researchers led by James M. Sallee of the University of California, Berkeley, examined monthly sales data for vehicles sold between July 1993 and June 2008 and found that consumers paid more for better mileage cars when fuel prices increased and paid less for them when fuel prices decreased. Consumers’ willingness to pay perfectly replicated expected future fuel costs without any government intervention.





It’s hard to disagree that fuel economy standards are bad policy.



CAFE supporters respond that the Obama standards weren’t intended to address consumer failings to appreciate fuel savings, but rather to reduce carbon emissions and their effects on the climate. But CAFE is a clumsy way to combat climate change, both because it targets only one source of greenhouse gases and because it does so indirectly and thus inefficiently.



A less costly way is to tax carbon emissions, which would encourage consumers to economize in both their gasoline use and their other carbon‐​emitting activities. The problem is that the public, and thus politicians, hate new taxes, even if they are revenue‐​neutral.



In addition, many prefer CAFE standards because they believe that taxes on carbon emissions are regressive, falling heavily on lower‐​income households. Academic researchers agree with this, but they find CAFE places an even heavier burden on those with low‐​incomes.



A recent paper by Georgetown economist Arik Levinson looks at the distributional implications of gasoline taxes, keeping in mind how the resulting tax revenues would be used. Levinson finds that the most affluent 5 percent of households have at least 10 times the income of the poorest 20 percent, but those rich households use only four times more gasoline. That means that a gasoline tax would be regressive in the sense that the affluent would pay a lower percentage of their income. But if the proceeds were then rebated equally to all households, the overall tax‐​plus‐​rebate program would be progressive because low‐​income households would get back more money than they paid.



CAFE standards are equivalent to a tax on the gasoline used per mile of travel. Thus to assess the distributional effects of CAFE standards, we need to know whether a direct tax on gasoline use increases faster with income than a “CAFE standard–equivalent” tax. Affluent households use four times as much gasoline as poor households, but affluent households use only three times the gasoline _per mile_ as poor households. Thus, an explicit tax on gasoline goes up faster with respect to income for affluent households than the tax‐​equivalent cost of CAFE standards with respect to income. Put more simply, a gasoline tax would be more progressive than the cost of CAFE standards.



CAFE’s regressivity has grown worse in recent years. There was once a single standard for cars and a single standard for trucks, but in 2011 the federal government began using different standards for small and large cars and small and large trucks. The larger vehicles face more lenient standards and, of course, wealthier people tend to drive larger vehicles. Thus, the new CAFE standards are even more regressive relative to a gas tax.



To summarize, academic researchers have shown that consumers correctly consider fuel costs when making vehicle‐​buying decisions. CAFE standards cannot be justified as correcting some sort of consumer failure to appreciate fuel savings. The idea that CAFE reduces carbon emissions is slightly more reasonable, but it is a very indirect, inefficient and regressive method. Thus it’s hard to disagree with the Trump administration that the CAFE standards are bad regulation.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN IPCC AR5 completely neglected discussing the reason why we have climate to begin with: THE SUN. There’s a reason why they did.
I’m pleased to say that Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s climate skeptic book “The Neglected Sun” is NUMBER 1 in several categories at Amazon.uk!


Of course, The Neglected Sun is not yet at the top of the charts overall, but it’s way up from a couple of days ago. Now with the AR5 report out, this book is more timely than ever. Pick up some extra copies for Christmas presents.
You can purchase it in paperback at the really great price of £9.09.
The book looks at all climate factors and doesn’t gloss over anything. There’s a reason why the IPCC avoids the sun – they’re scared to death of it. Lüning and Vahrenholt explain why.
And you’ll understand why Fritz Vahrenholt had to get a bodyguard and why the two authors became the German science establishment’s and climate activism’s most feared and disliked dissidents.

This government has to rank as the most inept, illogical and idiotic we have had the misfortune to endure. They sit in the House in Question Time like possums in the headlights. Unable to answer questions coherently, they are only saved from the equivalent of daily roadkill by the blatant bias displayed by Speaker Mallard. His knavery in continually wading to their defence is nothing short of a disgrace.



Worse than that though, are the decisions being made, many which reflect an inability to make sensible judgments. Ideology is overruling rational thinking which highlights a major problem with this government. They find ideology much easier to cope with than rational thinking which requires a mental capacity to first comprehend the subject matter and then formulate legislation based on logical thought. 



Examples of where failure has occurred in this regard are:



ENERGY. The virtual closing down of the oil and gas industry. A Captain’s call. The result is that the industry is sunk, just like the Titanic. Having done that, they declared a climate emergency and told everyone to buy an electric car. They then turned down an application to build a hydro dam on the West Coast in favour of a few kayakers. Hypocrisy in the extreme. If it wasn’t such a momentous act of stupidity we could all die laughing.



TRANSPORT. The Hamilton to Auckland train. It is, in fact, two trains with two fares and only two stops taking over two hours to complete the journey. Then there’s the Dominion Road tram. The initial costing was two billion but evidently it is now approaching seven. This tells you a lot about the financial prowess of these dunderheads. I wonder where that leaves the business case? Perhaps there isn’t one. Do they even know what a business case is?



EDUCATION. The closing of Charter schools. They are ruining the lives of children in need simply to please their Union masters. Due to other policy failures, school lunches are now having to be provided. The PM suggests that schools team up with the local bakery. What for? A pie, a doughnut and a coke? She failed to mention who would pay the bakery for the purchase of such wholesome treats. Here’s a better idea. How about the schools team up with parents and ask them why they can’t provide their child with a lunch. Perhaps even dare to talk about parental responsibility.



WELFARE. Their policies encourage lack of responsibility and as a result, the risk of indiscriminate procreation. Carmel Sepuloni made it very clear from the outset that antics in the bedroom were no concern of hers, but she would be only too happy to take financial care of the two legged consequences. The welfare cheques are so good they can’t get the nephews off the couch. And if the statistics are correct, they’re not getting people out of the poverty trap either.



HOUSING. The government has no place in the housing market. Its role is to build statehouses. The fiasco that is Kiwibuild proves this beyond doubt. The targeting of landlords with endless regulations means the resulting increased costs are being passed on to the tenants making renting even less affordable. Hence an increase in the housing waiting lists. They obviously couldn’t even work that out.



HEALTH. Millions are being poured into mental health for no positive effect. This is another example of left-wing ideology, that problems are solved by throwing money at them. Then there is the cancer agency broken promise and DHB financial blowouts.



CRIME. A ridiculous knee jerk reaction following the Christchurch massacre meaning law-abiding citizens are being forced to hand in their firearms while the gangs keep theirs. Judges are now handing down pathetic sentences to honour the Government’s policy of reducing the prison population. Multiple rape = home detention.



This is proving to be a government incapable of governing. The prime minister, as has been noted, is part-time at best, although full time wouldn’t make much of a difference. Her grasp of the issues of the day is woeful as evidenced weekly in the ums and ahs interview with Mike Hosking. The rest of her shambolic team is equally lightweight and clueless.   
We deserve better, but that will only happen with a change of government. National, and don’t we like to moan about them, are nowhere near this level of downright incompetence. With ACT to keep them honest, as opposed to NZF, I think we might get a government that could command some respect.



Give some serious thought as to how you might cast your vote next year.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwiss veteran journalist Alex Reichmuth at the online Weltwoche here writes that despite the lack of warming over past 15 years, recovering Arctic sea ice, and slowdown in sea level rise, “the warners of climate catastrophe are not impressed. Their arguments are getting more adventurous”. This especially in the wake of typhoon Yolanda.
Swiss journalist Alex Reichmuth (photo right) writes that flagging interest is frustrating global warming activists.
Progress on hammering out a globally binding climate emissions treaty has been moving at a glacial pace. Reichmuth also adds that “it is not only the political gridlock that is frustrating the climate catastrophe warners, but also flagging public interest in global warming.”
He writes that major Swiss media outlet SRF did not even bother sending any correspondents over the COP 19 conference in Warsaw, and says “the loss of interest also comes from the latest reports coming from science where there are few signs of catastrophe.”
Another sign, he writes, is the disappearance of Swiss warmist climate blog of the ETH in Zurich. “Now the blog is called ‘Future Blog’ and offers popular articles like on how to prevent waste from buffets by using Tupperware.”

" We’re already being swamped with ideas about “reforms” needed to recover from the pandemic crisis. But the word reform is like gift wrap – a handy cover for any offering, thought-through or otherwise. Perhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments “must” do to advance an author’s previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world.  Imagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a “war”. Think, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABC’s 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them “in” or “out”, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice – even if that policy hasn’t yet been outlined. Now consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia. I concede that’s quite a leap given the past decade of mind-numbing debate, during which experts have struggled to get a look in. But in the background, some have been giving it a shot. For six years now leading business, environmental, investor, union, farming and social welfare groups have been trying, largely in vain, to create a space for a sensible discussion about global heating, and to give Australian politicians a way to retreat from the self-defeating culture war that has scuppered all attempts at policy. They wouldn’t put it this way, but in effect the environmentalists, desperate for Australia to make some meaningful move towards reducing emissions, and the business groups, desperate for some kind of investment certainty, have been trying to save Australia’s politicians from themselves. The starting point for the Australian Climate Roundtable’s deliberations is that Australia needs to reach net zero emissions, and that delaying action just increases the cost of reaching that goal. Unremarkable propositions in any fact-based forum, but in some Coalition circles, still close to heresy. Now the roundtable, including its business members, argues that this post-corona reconstruction is a chance to speed up decarbonising the economy. The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, argued in an opinion piece that the post-corona discussion should divest itself of “ideological constraints”. “In resuscitating our economy, we can tackle some of our most vexed problems. Every dollar we invest in energy should be a dollar towards a lower carbon economy and lower energy bills,” she wrote. And expert evidence about what might be possible has been flooding in by the day. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week released its long awaited “renewable integration study”, which found Australia could accommodate levels of up to 75% “instant” penetration of wind and solar in its main grid by 2025 – that we have the know-how, but need to update market and regulatory settings. Think about that next time someone starts burbling on about the impossibility of a renewable-dependent grid coping “when the wind don’t blow and the sun don’t shine”. Less than a year after an election in which Bill Shorten’s target of 45% renewables by 2030 was attacked for being “unachievable” and “economy wrecking”, the expert market operator says 75% is technically achievable – and in just five years time. And then there was the advice from the International Energy Agency this week that renewable electricity will be the only energy source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years, triggered by the pandemic. The Morrison government is supposed to be working on a “roadmap” towards some kind of long-term emissions reduction policy, understandably delayed while it deals with the pandemic. It could draw on the work of a bunch of expert groups who have already had a go – the latest Climateworks report released earlier this month found that net zero emissions by 2035 is possible in Australia, using technologies that are mostly already mature and available. The CSIRO’s roadmap released last year found there was no trade-off between  economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions, and in fact strong action could lead to GDP growth, an increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050. But then, apparently pre-empting his own policy, and contradicting his own government’s claim to be “technology neutral”, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has spent the week calling for a “gas-fired recovery”, variously advocating more gas-peaking plants, more long-term gas supply for manufacturers and more onshore gas production. The details of what he’s advocating remain opaque, but as the Grattan Institute’s energy expert Tony Wood points out, renewed suggestions of government intervention are only likely to deter investment, presumably the opposite of what Taylor is seeking. If there’s a coherent policy in there somewhere, it really is time for the government to unwrap it. The experts have been waiting for years, and it turns out that listening to them is a good idea."

Amidst the many headline‐​grabbing moments of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, both parties released their platforms for the 2016 election. While both platforms mentioned the U.S.-China relationship, there was very little room for agreement on how the United States should deal with China in the years to come. The Republicans and Democrats both displayed some “dragon slayer” tendencies — after all nobody wants to look weak in international politics. But the platforms showed substantive differences on how Washington should deal with Beijing.



The Democrats: Continuing the Pivot



The core of the Democratic platform is the Obama administration’s “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, which was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. The platform considers East Asian allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines to be essential for achieving U.S. interests in the region. According to the platform, “We will also work with our allies and partners to fortify regional institutions and norms as well as protect freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.” Importantly, allies are not explicitly called on to balance against China or try to contain its rise.





No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.



The primary source of hawkish language on China in the Democratic platform is found on page 49. The platform states, “We will stand up to Beijing on unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, censorship of the internet, piracy, and cyberattacks.” However, and in stark contrast to the Republican platform, the very next sentence mentions “areas of cooperation” with Beijing that the Democrats will pursue. Seeking cooperation with China on issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation and standing up to Beijing when important interests are threatened is a continuation of the Obama administration’s policies.



If Hillary Clinton wins in November and follows through on this platform, then expect the United States to stay the course in the pivot to Asia. Whether or not this policy will achieve its intended goals is questionable given China’s intransigence in response to the Obama administration’s policies, but Beijing likely prefers a continuation of the pivot to the harsh stance spelled out in the GOP platform.



The Republicans: China is the Enemy, and We Will Defeat It



The Republican platform is adamant about the threat China poses to the United States and cooperation is practically impossible. According to the Republicans, the United States has tried playing nice with China, but has gotten nothing in return besides unfair trade policies, regional instability, grave human rights violations, and the revival of “the cult of Mao.” Chinese activities in the South China Sea are one example of how the Obama administration’s weakness has “invited aggression.” China is presented as an enemy, and the United States does not cooperate with its enemies.



The Republican platform is also more hawkish on Taiwan. Taiwan’s democratic system of government, human rights record, and open economy are “saluted” in the GOP platform, but not in the Democratic platform. This makes American support for, and if need be defense of, Taiwan essential for normative, not just practical reasons. Additionally, the Republicans affirm the Six Assurances to Taiwan made by President Reagan in 1982, which the Democratic platform does not mention.



Implementing the GOP platform would put the United States into an outright adversarial relationship with China characterized by greater U.S. criticism of China’s human rights record and activities in cyberspace, and a stronger U.S. military stance to prevent weakness from inviting aggression. However, it is unclear how much of the platform would be implemented by Donald Trump if he is elected president. His tough talk on economic issues suggests adherence to those aspects of the platform, but weakening U.S. alliance relationships could undermine the platform’s language on Taiwan and the treaty allies.



Both the Republican and Democratic platforms reflect a willingness to get tougher with China, albeit in different ways and to a different degree. The Democrats want to continue the pivot to Asia and strengthen the alliance system that Chinese leaders see as a vehicle for containment. The Republicans want to reclaim a moral high ground and confront China on its human rights record, territorial ambitions, and cyber activities. No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.

"Gunjur Beach should be a pearl in the crown of the Gambia, a small sliver of a country in West Africa. Long stretches of silver sand are lined with coconut palms, while many generations of fishermen from nearby Senegal have used this beach as a landing point for their colourful and masterfully crafted wooden boats. And in the past 30 years several bars and eco-tourism ventures have moved into the area, serving “voluntourists” and bird watchers. I have just returned from Gunjur, where I was researching its historical community-based link with the town of Marlborough in the UK. During my visit, I met various members of the community to explore the particular development challenges faced there today.  I heard that, for the past few years, the seafront at Gunjur has been at the centre of a tense environmental and social dispute, one that magnifies wider concerns about the nature of Chinese investment in The Gambia.  The dispute is over a factory that produces fishmeal, a product obtained by drying and grinding fish or fish waste. It is usually sold as powder before being added to other foods and fed to poultry, pigs or farmed fish.  In 2016, a Chinese-owned fishmeal manufacturer, Golden Lead, opened a factory and started operations at Gunjur Beach. The factory is flanked by the ocean on one side and on the other the Bolong Fenyo – a lagoon with lots of birds that was Gambia’s first community wildlife reserve. Golden Lead’s operational contract was issued by the previous government of Yahya Jammeh, an autocrat who was much reviled for reported corruption and human rights abuses. Some locals worried about its environmental impact but, nonetheless, the factory was initially welcomed. Locals believed Golden Lead promised improved infrastructure, increased employment and training for Gambians. With relatively high wages on offer, around 80 people took up jobs. However tensions soon surfaced over the factory’s use of ocean-caught bonga, a fish that Gunjurians have long relied upon as a cheap and abundant source of protein. Increased pressure on supplies has already pushed up bonga prices. Local residents allege that since the factory arrived in Gunjur, swathes of dead fish and mammals – including whales, turtles, dolphins, eels and rays – have washed up on the beach. Things started to escalate when, in 2017, the Bolong Fenyo suddenly changed colour and fish and birds in the protected reserve started to die. Biomedical scientist Ahmed Manjang tested the local water and found it was unusually high in phosphates. Local environmentalists blamed a waste pipe running from the factory building into the ocean (fishmeal factories tend to produce lots of wastewater). However, Golden Lead had previously denied that it had been dumping wastewater products.  The Gambian National Environment Agency (NEA) then got involved, and ordered Golden Lead to treat its wastewater and remove the pipe. However, after months of inaction, local residents and environmental activists gave Golden Lead an ultimatum: move the pipe within seven days or we will. And so, on March 22 2018, that’s exactly what they did. Up to 150 young Gunjurians assembled on the beach, where they were met by a large deployment of police. A group of activists armed with shovels physically dug out and removed the pipe. In spite of the NEA’s earlier demands, Golden Lead was soon permitted to reinstall a waste pipe. Local news agency, Gunjur News Online said the move was politically motivated, with their sources suggesting that the government stepped in due to concerns about discouraging potential investors. Foreign income is much sought after by the Gambian government, which must contend with a large current account deficit and public debt. At the end of May 2018, a new pipe was installed with a certain amount of theatricality. Golden Lead this time chose a central spot on Gunjur beach to lay the waste pipe and staff members raised a Chinese flag in the process. This act was perceived as a provocation by members of a community whose entire village was once destroyed during colonial land grabs at the end of the 18th century. As one activist told me:  When they planted a flag on our beach like that, we really saw this as an insult. While we are not against investment in the area, we do ask that these things are undertaken responsibly and that they do not cause harm to our people and environment. Local activists continue to allege the plant is responsible for pollution and overfishing, but the government says it is satisfied Golden Lead has cleaned up its act. Golden Lead denied to the Guardian in March 2019 that it outcompetes local fish sellers and said it had a zero tolerance approach to pollution. As also reported in the paper, Jojo Huang, the director of the fishmeal plant, has also previously stated that the factory was “in no way responsible for the dumping of fish in the local area” and that it “does not pump chemicals into the sea and has followed guidance from the National Environment Agency on waste management”. However, community members have now filed court cases seeking reparations for environmental degradation, so the story continues to unfold. Gunjur is the site of one of three Chinese-owned fishmeal plants that have recently set up operations in the Gambia. The Guardian reports that the other factory sites at Kartong and Sanyang have both faced temporary closures due to complaints and protests linked to waste disposal methods.  Together with the Gunjur site, these three factories provide a glimpse of the tensions between the need to economically develop and attract foreign investment, and local environmental and socio-economic issues. And as someone who researches the politics of resistance in the global south, what is especially encouraging about events in the Gambia to me is that this local activism represents a rebirth of civil society following the demise of the Jammeh regime."
"Hydrothermal vents host rare species at incredibly high density comparable to tropical rainforests or coral reefs. Forty years ago, the first descriptions of the ecosystems around these deep underwater heat funnels changed our understanding of deep ocean environments and the very origins of life. Now, species in even the most inaccessible parts of Earth are threatened by disturbance from human activity, including mining the depths of the ocean.   Technological impediments, and commodity prices, mean that deep sea mining may not be immediately economically viable. But many companies and nations motivated by geopolitics or other subtler calculus than simple profit mean extraction is already happening. The targets of seabed mining include volcanic areas where hydrothermal processes can concentrate rare minerals, including gold, zinc, and cobalt and lithium that are key components in lithium-ion batteries. Yet there is no provision for these biodiversity hotspots to receive blanket protection from the development of deep sea mining.  Now an update to the global IUCN Red List, the global inventory of the conservation status of Earth’s species, includes Chrysomallon squamiferum – known as the scaly-foot snail or Sea Pangolin – the first marine species to be assessed as officially endangered due to the potential threat of deep sea mining. The Red List was developed for well-studied species with possible ways to restore them, but as we show in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the Red List is also a powerful, proven tool for protecting even the most remote and poorly understood animals.

      Unless we regain our historic awe of the deep ocean, it will be plundered


 The assessment process for the Sea Pangolin started with an epiphany on the high seas. In early 2016, deep sea biologist Chong Chen and I were part of a deep sea expedition to the Kairei hydrothermal vent field in the Indian Ocean. We were there to work on the Sea Pangolin, to understand adaptations to life in hydrothermal vents. The Sea Pangolin was a key part of that scientific mission; we were re-visiting a site where these snails were known to occur. Many people in the science party had prior experience collecting this species, but, we just couldn’t find them. Where were they? Had something happened to them?  As biologists, we really love the species we work on, and I vividly remember the sick feeling when we started to really worry that we were not going to find the Sea Pangolin on that expedition. We knew more about this species than anyone else, but we didn’t know where they had gone.  Kairei vent field is over 2,400 metres deep (about 1.5 miles), and almost 900km away from the nearest point of land. The vent field itself is tiny, like most hydrothermal vents or geothermal sites on land, Kairei is less than a third of a football field. Areas beyond 12 nautical miles (22.2km) away from any coast fall under the purview of the International Seabed Authority, which was established by the United Nations to manage deep sea benthic space and resources.  The UN refers to the seabed as “the common heritage of mankind”, but the focus of the International Seabed Authority (with scientific advice from the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative) is now deep sea mining. At that time, the Sea Pangolin was known from only three sites, though we knew informally that one additional population had recently been discovered. Even with undiscovered sites, the total habitat area available for the Sea Pangolin extends up to a generous potential maximum of 0.27km² (0.1 square miles).  Today, all sites but one have active mining exploration licenses, and none of them have any protection from deep sea mining.  At sea in 2016, it took more than three weeks for our team to find a colony of the snails, but we did eventually find a healthy population and we were able to complete our experiments. We also realised that we needed a better way to explain the vulnerability of these species and spaces, in a way that everyone can understand.  A few months after we got back to land, I connected with the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Mollusc Specialist Group. Chong and I started gathering the information we would need to complete a Red List assessment from our prior published research on the Sea Pangolin.  When we talked about this work to other deep sea biologists, some disliked the idea of Red List status for their study animals. “That will just be really inconvenient,” said one. They worried that if international recognition leads to legal protection, it would prohibit them from collecting specimens for research, or that sharing preserved specimens would be confused with wildlife trafficking, and that these prohibitions could delay research or create mountains of paperwork. But many have a different view now. Personally, I am willing to risk some minor inconvenience. It is far more difficult to work on a species that is extinct, than one that gets the protection it deserves.  We are now expanding Red List assessments from the Indian Ocean to all species found in deep sea hydrothermal vent habitats around the world, in a project led by Elin Thomas, as part of her PhD studies in my group at Queen’s University Belfast. Endangered status for hydrothermal vent species only found in areas under license for mining exploration, could be compared to a species that only lives in a patch of rainforest scheduled for logging. Not all hydrothermal vent species will be classified as endangered, and status can change for the worse, or for better. In the last global update of the Red List, not a single species improved in status. Active hydrothermal vents are not the only targets for deep sea mining and while extinct vents and other sites may be larger and more practical for extraction, they also pose serious environmental concerns. If active hydrothermal vents were protected against the threat of deep sea mining, the endangered status of the Sea Pangolin could be lifted."
"Bovine tuberculosis is a major problem in the UK: in 2013 around 8m cattle were tested and 32,000 slaughtered at a cost of an estimated £100m, including compensation – a huge economic burden that makes controlling the disease essential. However, far from controlling bovine TB (bTB), over the past 20 years or so there has been a 10% increase in cases each year. This rise, and the role of TB-infected badgers, is fiercely debated. Badgers were first associated with bTB in the 1970s, but despite the lengthy and expensive Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the late 1990s there is still limited scientific consensus. One of the main difficulties in trying to untangle the routes through which bTB is transmitted is the fact that it spreads unseen. In general, infected animals are only identified through a skin test, which in itself we estimate to be only 72% sensitive – so 28% of infectious animals are undetected by a single test. With more than a quarter of infected animals going undetected, controlling the disease’s spread is difficult, and identifying how it spreads harder still. Published in Nature, we have developed a mechanistic model of the spread of bTB within and between around 134,000 cattle farms in Great Britain, between 1996 and 2011. This model accounts for multiple routes of transmission: direct infections between cattle, indirectly through the environment, and through the movement of infected animals between farms. Because the model is mechanistic it allows us to test the effects of different methods of control on how the disease spreads. Due to the lack of detailed data, our model does not explicitly include badgers (cattle are ear-tagged, their movements recorded, and are frequently tested for bTB; the same can’t be done for wildlife). Instead we model the combined environmental reservoir of infection – this includes infection from pasture and wildlife species, although it is impossible to separate these two elements.  We don’t feel that this detracts from our findings, as the model is able to accurately capture the trends of infection over time and the geographic spread. We haven’t found any evidence that our model underestimates the rate of infection in regions where badgers are common, which would occur if the model underestimated their importance. Our modelling approach was able to shed light on the relative strengths of different transmission routes. Unlike the real world where infections can only be seen by testing (and then with limited accuracy) within our simulation model we can track infection perfectly. This allows us to tease apart the causes of infection.  We find that newly infected farms are most frequently due to movement of infected animals, rather than spread through the environmental reservoir, but most importantly the majority of infection originates from the minority of farms. More than 90% of infected farms clear the infection before they cause any secondary cases, while about 2% of farms infect 10 or more other farms.  Our model shows just how complex and multifaceted bTB transmission is, with cattle-to-cattle transmission, failure to detect infectious cases, the movement of infected animals to other farms, and the effects of TB in the environment all playing a role. It is this complexity that continues to deny those seeking to eradicate the disease any easy solutions. We tested a range of control measures in our model simulation to see what effects they might have. We assumed that these measures began in 2005 and were continued for six years, after which we evaluated their impact. Of ten we simulated, only three measures were found to stop the annual increase in cases. By far the most dramatic is whole-herd culling of all cattle on infected farms. This would rapidly bring the epidemic under control, as it removes the danger of infected but as yet undetected animals. But it would entail a 20-fold increase of cattle slaughter in the first year, and the political, social, and economic consequences that would bring. However, with the cost of bTB at £100m a year and rising, some form of highly targeting culling could be economically viable. Vaccinating cattle, which slows the disease’s progression in animals, is also predicted sufficient to prevent the increase in cases, although only just. Such a vaccine would not have the effectiveness we associate with mass vaccination programmes in humans. In any case, the vaccine is currently unlicensed and runs into problems with EU legislation. More widespread and regular testing and slaughter of infected animals in the initial years would identify more cases (we only find bTB when we look for it, after all) and lead to more slaughter, but over time the benefits of a more stringent regime are felt and cases fall in later years. A similar effect can be achieved if we developed a better test for bTB. What the model also predicted was the relatively limited effect of focusing on environmental factors would be. Even with a 50% fall in the between-farm transmission of infection due to the environment (simulating a substantial badger cull, for example), the rise in cattle infections over six years continues, although at a slower rate. All three of these measures (culling, increased testing and cattle vaccination) have associated economic costs and benefits, which the government, the livestock industry and the general public must assess to decide the correct course of action. What our simulation provides, based on the latest data, is a way to predict and put numbers to a range of potential policy options. Clearly there is a need to reverse this costly and damaging bTB epidemic, and we hope our findings will help inform decisions in the future."
"Have you have seen ants this year? In Britain, they were probably black garden ants, known as Lasius niger – Europe’s most common ant. One of somewhere between 12,000 and 20,000 species, they are the scourge of gardeners – but also fascinating.  The small, black, wingless workers run around the pavements, crawl up your plants tending aphids or collect tasty morsels from your kitchen. And the flying ants that occasionally appear on a warm summer’s evening are actually the reproductive siblings of these non-winged workers. Here’s what else you need to know: Ants have a caste system, where responsibilities are divided. The queen is the founder of the colony, and her role is to lay eggs. Worker ants are all female, and this sisterhood is responsible for the harmonious operation of the colony.  Their tasks range from caring for the queen and the young, foraging, policing conflicts in the colony, and waste disposal. Workers will most likely never have their own offspring. The vast majority of eggs develop as workers, but once the colony is ready the queen produces the next generation of reproductives which will go on to start own colonies. A female ant’s fate to become a worker or queen is mainly determined by diet, not genetics. Any female ant larva can become the queen – those that do receive diets richer in protein. The other larvae receive less protein, which causes them to develop as workers. Unlike humans, with X and Y chromosomes, an ant’s sex is determined by the number of genome copies it possesses. Male ants develop from unfertilised eggs so receive no genome from a father. This means that male ants don’t have a father and cannot have sons, but they do have grandfathers and can have grandsons. Female ants, in comparison, develop from fertilised eggs and have two genome copies – one from their father and one from their mother. Male ants function like flying sperm. Only having one genome copy means every one of their sperm is genetically identical to themselves. And their job is over quickly, dying soon after mating, although their sperm live on, perhaps for years. 
– essentially their only job is to reproduce.  When the conditions are warm and humid, the winged virgin queens and males leave their nests in search of mates. This is the behaviour seen on “flying ant day”. In L. niger, mating takes place on the wing, often hundreds of meters up (hence the need for good weather). Afterwards, queens drop to the ground and shed their wings, while males quickly die. Mated queens choose a nest site and burrow into the soil, made softer from recent rain.

      The amazing secrets behind 'flying ant day'


 Once underground, the queens will not eat for weeks – until they have produced their own daughter workers. They use energy from their fat stores and redundant flight muscles to lay their first batch of eggs, which they fertilise using sperm stored from their nuptial flight. It is the same stock of sperm acquired from long dead males that allows a queen to continue laying fertilised eggs for her entire life. Queens never mate again. Sometimes two L. niger queens unite to found a nest. This initially cooperative association – which increases the chance of establishing a colony – dissolves once new adult workers emerge and then the queens fight to the death. More sinister still, L. niger colonies sometimes steal brood from their neighbours, putting them to work as slaves.  Slave-making has evolved in a number of ant species, but they also display cooperation at extraordinary levels. An extreme example of this is a “supercolony” of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) which extends over 6,000km of European coastline from Italy to north-west Spain, and is composed of literally billions of workers from millions of cooperating nests. After establishing her colony, the queen’s work is not done and she has many years of egg-laying ahead of her. In the laboratory, L. niger queens have lived for nearly 30 years. Workers live for about a year, males little more than a week (although their sperm live longer). These extraordinary differences in longevity are purely due to the way their genes are switched on and off. Ants have a major influence in ecosystems worldwide and their roles are diverse. While some ants are considered pests, others act as biological-control agents. Ants benefit ecosystems by dispersing seeds, pollinating plants and improving the quality of soil. Ants might also benefit our health, as a potential source of new medicines such as antibiotics.  So when you next see an ant, before you think to kill her, consider how fascinating she really is."

From the warmest July on record, according to some, we are suddenly plunged into a freezing cold August. Snow, hail storms and negative or single-digit temperatures find us huddling under our duvets waiting for Spring.



A climate scientist says last month was New Zealand’s warmest July on the books, going by a measure that took in more than the official number of stations.  
Niwa is shortly due to release the official statistics for July, which its meteorologist Ben Noll last week said was on track to finish somewhere in the top five.  
New Zealand’s warmest July ever recorded, at 1.8C above average, came in 1998 – just as that year’s devastating El Nino climate system was dissipating.  
Toward the end of last month, the official July temperature record was tracking at about 1.5C above average. 



  
Either the snow gods are playing tricks or we got global warming wrong or the weather is not an indicator of climate change – which is what the man-made climate change subscribers tell us. Ignore extreme weather patterns, they say, because it indicates global warming. Huh? 



But if we think we got badly frozen, spare a thought for the US which fared no better. Their 2018/2019 winter saw the coldest temperatures ever recorded in all 50 US states. 



“One of the most interesting facts is that every state in the continental U.S. has seen [temperatures drop below zero](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records).



Even Florida dropped to 2 degrees below zero on Feb. 13, 1899, in Tallahassee. This occurred during an Arctic outbreak during which numerous all-time record low temperatures were set, including Washington D.C. (15 degrees below zero); Atlanta, (9 degrees below zero); and Dallas (8 degrees below zero). Flurries were even reported from Tampa to New Orleans during that massive outbreak.



The only state that has not seen a subzero temperature is Hawai’i. The coldest temperature recorded in Hawai’i is 12 degrees at the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is at an elevation of 13,796 feet, on May 17, 1979.



Of course, as expected, the coldest temperature in the U.S. was set in Alaska. The mercury plummeted to 80 degrees below zero on Jan. 23, 1971 in Prospect Creek in central Alaska, north of Fairbanks.



The coldest temperature recorded in the contiguous U.S. is 70 degrees below zero, measured at Rogers Pass, Montana, on Jan. 20, 1954.



The oldest record was set on Jan. 22, 1885 on Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest peak in the Northeast, when the thermometer dropped to 50 degrees below zero.



The most recent record on the list was set on Feb. 10, 2011 in Nowata, Oklahoma, when the temperature reached 31 degrees below zero.”



  
To compensate for the freezing cold weather here and in the US – Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK reached the hottest recording-breaking levels during the last week of July. We are experiencing worldwide extreme weather patterns.



If you are confused about global warming, spare a thought for the climate scientists who are divided on the subject of man-made global warming. The scientists who go on record in the Mainstream Media say climate change is responsible for the worldwide extremes in weather patterns. But it seems to me that climate data can be manipulated to say whatever it is that they want it to say to fulfil their particular political or financial agendas.

Ah, summer in our cities, where the climate is woebegone and the temperature is almost always above normal.



Cities tend to get warmer, whether or not there is global or regional warming. Bricks, buildings and pavement absorb more heat during the day than a “natural” vegetated state, and urban structures impede the flow of ventilating winds. The result is that, as cities grow, temperatures rise. In Washington, there is additional warming caused by the waste heat from all the money changing hands.



The official (and silly) definition of “normal” temperature is the average for the past 30 years. In a growing urban environment (which includes suburban sprawl) that number is likely to be lower than what it is now.



As a result, cities are inadvertently testing a dear hypothesis of my greener friends: that global warming will result in increasing heat‐​related mortality.



Those who have read _Freakonomics_ can see this hanging curveball. Global warming should _reduce_ urban mortality as heat waves become more frequent.



I’ve done a bit of work in this area. Robert Davis, a former colleague at the University of Virginia, and I examined three decades of heat‐​related mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control for the 28 largest U.S. cities. We then teamed up with a UVa medical statistician, Wendy Novicoff, who made sure we adjusted for different demographics between cities; we did this because the elderly and infants are most susceptible to heat‐​related mortality, and we wanted to compare disproportionately old cities (like Phoenix) with disproportionally young ones (like Seattle). After all was said and done, we found that heat‐​related mortality is dropping like a stone in almost every major urban area in the nation.



Before you go to the “comments” and blast me with the European heat wave of 2003 or the Chicago disaster in 1995, read on.



The 2003 heat wave in Europe was devastating. In France alone, and very dependent on the way you count things, it appears there were about 35,000 excess deaths. That heat wave was a lulu, with European temperatures about three standard deviations above the average, something that has a 1‐​in‐​333 chance of occurring averaged over your state or province. Given that there are a lot of places of similar size on the planet, such an anomaly can usually be found somewhere. In 2003, that somewhere just happened to be at the epicenter of global warming angst.



Then there was the great French heat wave of 2006.



Whoops. Don’t know about that one? Climatically, it was pretty comparable, but far fewer French fried.



A. Fouillet and his team of researchers wrote this up in a 2008 paper in the _International Journal of Epidemiology_. They started off with a simple (i.e. logical and testable) model relating temperature to mortality and found that something in addition to the heat killed a lot of people in 2003. While their model predicted about 17 deaths per 100,000, the observed rate was 21 per 100,000, or about nearly 7,000 bodies.



(There’s plenty of speculation on the cause, with fingers pointed at France’s August recess, when everyone — including health care workers — takes to the beach or the hills and leaves the old folks at the non‐​airconditioned home)



In 2006, their model showed nearly 4,500 _fewer_ deaths than expected.



What the French did was (begrudgingly) emulate urban Americans. They _adapted_. The government bought air conditioning (formerly a crass Yankee invention) for retirement homes. They implemented a National Heat Wave Plan that keeps tabs on the elderly, who were left to swelter in 2003. They set up cooling shelters for those without A/C.



And, of course, adaptation is what’s happening in our cities. Perhaps the most politically incorrect thing an urban administration can do is to be caught flatfooted by the weather. Chicago’s Daley dynasty was (temporarily) swept away by a 1979 snowstorm when it selectively canceled rail service in southside black neighborhoods. And who can forget Washington’s colorful mayor Marion Barry, cavorting at the 1987 Super Bowl during back‐​to‐​back storms. White stuff set him up.



Want proof of our adaptation to heat? Two extremely hot cities, Tampa and Phoenix, have virtually no heat‐​related mortality, despite sporting the oldest populations in our study. In only one city is mortality increasing. That would be young and vibrant Seattle, where summer heat is still very rare.



I am sure many consider it immoral to export heat‐​related mortality to the North, but that won’t last for long. Seattle’s latitude is about 48 degrees north. The vast majority of our hemisphere’s cities are south of there, and by the time you get to 60 degrees, not very far away, you tend to run out of cities. At that point, global warming will have squeezed urban heat‐​related mortality off of the map.

As we’ve mentioned before on the Cato blog, over the past few weeks some members of Congress have been sending letters of intimidation to researchers whose scientific findings were politically inconvenient to the members' policy proposals. First, seven scientists working at public universities were harassed by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ). This was followed by letters to 100 organizations, ranging from private companies to think tanks, attempting to create a whisper campaign of allegations of impropriety. My boss, Cato CEO John Allison, received one of these letters.   
  
Mr. Allison’s response to the letter he received from Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is reproduced below the jump.   
  
We at the Center for the Study of Science, as with the rest of the Cato Institute, are very proud not only of the quality of the work we produce but also of our values—and those morals compel us to not bow to those using their authority as a weapon to silence legitimate scientific inquiry.   
  
The actions of these members of Congress are exactly why Cato’s Center for the Study of Science was founded: the government wishes to use science as a weapon to increase its political power, then use that political power to create a more convenient political climate. We wish to change this climate of fear into one of truth—and we would like to extend an invitation to Sens. Markey, Boxer, and Whitehouse to join us.

Germany began the month of April with winter-like conditions, but the weather managed to warm up by mid month and ended up being just about normal, temperature-wise, according to the German Weather Service.
No sign of global warming.
For precipitation, it was drier than normal in Germany – for the 5th April in a row. The amount of sunshine was also slightly below average, according to the DWD. The results are based on measurements taken from 2000 surface stations across the country.
The DWD reports that the mean temperature for April was 8.2° Celsius, which is 0.8°C warmer than the relatively cool international reference period of 1961 – 1990, but 0.1°C cooler than the 1981 to 2010 period. And because March was far below normal, the 2013 MAM spring period so far is much cooler than normal.
The DWD writes that the temperature sank to -14°C in Stiege in the Harz region, where “vegetation was 3 weeks behind”. The warmest day was April 18, when a maximum temperature of 28.1°C was measured in Dresden-Strehlen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBjorn Lomborg comments at Facebook on the Cook 97% survey. Has climate science gotten so bad that it is now resorting to utterly phony claims? Cook confirms that indeed it has.

Here’s what Lomborg writes (my emphasis, links shortened):
Ugh. Do you remember the “97% consensus”, which even Obama tweeted?
Turns out the authors don’t want to reveal their data.
It has always been a dodgy paper (iopscience.iop.org/article). Virtually everyone I know in the debate would automatically be included in the 97% (including me, but also many, much more skeptical)….
The paper looks at 12,000 papers written in the last 25 years (see here, the paper doesn’t actually specify the numbers, notalotofpeopleknowthat/).
It ditches about 8,000 papers because they don’t take a position. They put people who agree into three different bins — 1.6% that explicitly endorse global warming with numbers, 23% that explicitly endorse global warming without numbers and then 74% that “implicitly endorse” because they’re looking at other issues with global warming that must mean they agree with human-caused global warming.
Voila, you got about 97% (actually here 98%, but because the authors haven’t released the numbers themselves, we have to rely on other quantative assessments).
Notice, that *nobody* said anything about *dangerous* global warming; this meme simply got attached afterwards (by Obama and many others).
Now, Richard Tol has tried to replicate their study and it turns out they have done pretty much everything wrong. And they don’t want to release the data so anyone else can check it. Outrageous.
Read Tol’s letter to the Peter Høj, University of Queensland: ‘the main finding of the paper is incorrect, invalid and unrepresentative.’ (www.uq.edu.au/about/vice-chancellor)
It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so sad.

For decades, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has calculated the benefits of proposed regulations. These calculations are necessary both to justify regulation under the language of statutes they implement, such as the Clean Air Act, and to present the cost‐​benefit analysis that has been required under executive orders since the Reagan Administration.



Very often, as was the case for EPA’s 2012 assessment of the benefits of tightening the standard for fine particulates known as PM 2.5, EPA estimates regulatory benefits by multiplying epidemiologists’ estimate of the reduction in premature mortality that a new standard would generate by the value of a statistical life reported by economists.



For other regulations, such as the so‐​called tailpipe regulation of 2010 that raised automobile Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, EPA has relied in part on epidemiological studies to get a value for statistical lives saved, but also in part on purely economic studies of the value of higher mileage vehicles to consumers.





EPA’s rulemakings have increasingly been based on statistical analysis that has never been subject to rigorous testing and critique.



During the spring and summer of 2018, EPA issued two rulemaking proposals that together could significantly improve its benefit calculation process. The first, and most important rule, proposed in April, would require EPA to ensure that the data justifying its regulations be “publicly available in a manner sufficient for independent validation.” The second proposal, issued in June, is a request for comment on potential EPA rulemaking on how the agency conducts cost‐​benefit analysis.



Both proposals may seem abstract and technical. But, in fact, they could fundamentally change the process by which EPA calculates regulatory benefits. Indeed, they could effect such a fundamental improvement to the EPA’s calculation of regulatory benefits that under processes revised to conform to the new regulations, benefits under both the 2012 PM 2.5 standard and the 2010 tailpipe rule would be revealed to be much smaller than EPA reported, and far smaller than their costs.



Consider first the April proposed rule that would require the public availability of the data and methods used to calculate regulatory benefits. By requiring that EPA regulations be based on data that are actually available for statistical testing by outside, non‐​EPA affiliated researchers, this rule would bring EPA practices up to the standard exercised in every scientific discipline, where peer‐​edited journals require that authors share data with other researchers and, in some instances, even require study authors to post online both data and statistical code used to derive published results. The reason that scientific journals require these disclosures is fundamental to the scientific process: Unless the authors of published work share their data and methods, future researchers cannot verify whether the reported results can be replicated and relied upon as a basis of further work.



Public availability of data and methods is crucial to the progress of science because only with such availability can scientists avoid going down dead‐​end roads built on previous results that were actually false. Such public availability is even more important in the regulatory context, where false scientific findings do not just cause researchers to waste time and money pursuing dead‐​end research, but they also justify regulations costing billions of dollars and sometimes thousands of jobs. Before such regulations are issued, the underlying science must be publicly available for replication and critical review.



The environmental lobby has objected that the April proposed rule would cut the legs out from important regulations that have been justified by studies—epidemiological studies, in particular—whose data have never been made publicly accessible for replication and review. This is true, but it is not a bad thing.



To see why, consider a particularly important EPA rule: the Obama‐​era EPA’s 2012 rule tightening the standard for fine particulates or fine PM—that is, particles of dust and various pollutants less than 2.5 microns in diameter. As reported by the Office of Management and Budget, since 2004, the monetized value of the benefits from tougher fine PM standards make up the majority of—and for some years over 80 percent of—the quantified benefits of _all_ regulatory benefits. The Obama EPA used the quantified benefits of fine PM reduction not only to support the new fine PM standard, but also as a side effect or “co‐​benefit” justifying tougher standards for other air pollutants, such as ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and even greenhouse gases.



In calculating the benefits of toughening the fine PM standard, the Obama EPA relied heavily on two long‐​term studies—called cohort studies—of particular individuals exposed to varying levels of fine PM. The goal of a cohort study is to see whether exposure to a particular pollutant or engaging in a particular behavior, like smoking, increases mortality risk. Cohort studies are widely used in epidemiology and biomedical research. Like clinical trials for new drugs—where a known group of people are given a new drug, and two other groups are given a placebo and an existing drug already on the market—cohort studies enlist a known group of individuals for study.



The environmental lobby argues against EPA’s proposed rule primarily by noting that data from such cohort studies cannot be made publicly available without compromising promises of confidentiality made to study subjects. This argument is ludicrous. As the EPA’s April proposed rule notes, there are well‐​known protocols for ensuring that cohort study data can be shared for purposes of replication and further scientific work without compromising the identity of study participants.



For example, following the standard practice of the Organization for Economic Co‐​operation and Development (OECD), the Medical Research Council of Great Britain _requires_ the sharing of data from any study that it funds. At the same time, the Medical Research Council also requires that “data‐​sharing agreements must prohibit any attempt to identify study participants from the released data or otherwise breach confidentiality” or “make unapproved contact with study participants.” EPA can and should impose precisely the same requirements.



During the Obama Administration, EPA’s fallback to the obvious absurdity of the argument that making data publicly available would compromise confidentiality was to make an even more absurd argument: that EPA could not get the data because it was owned by researchers who had conducted the cohort studies, not by EPA.



The problem with this argument is that both of the long‐​term cohort studies that provided the primary evidence for EPA’s 2013 toughening of the fine PM standard were primarily funded by EPA itself. For example, as I describe in more detail in my chapter in the forthcoming Cato Institute book, _Science and Liberty_ , the Health Effects Institute, which paid for reanalysis and an extended reanalysis of a long‐​term cohort study called the Harvard Six Cities Study, has received at least $87 million from EPA since 2000. If EPA is paying for research, there is no reason in the world why it cannot follow the standard OECD practice of requiring both that data from such studies be shared with other researchers and that safeguards be put in place to ensure that confidentiality is not breached in that sharing.



Scientific journals these days routinely contain a list of articles corrected or retracted entirely because the results they reported have failed the scientific litmus test of replication. Certain fields, such as social psychology, now operate under a perceived “replication crisis” due to the discovery that large bodies of supposedly true results established by stars in the field were either based on fabricated data or simply cannot be replicated.



EPA’s proposed rule requiring the public availability of data does no more than make EPA current with best scientific practice. Without such public availability of data, EPA regulations are not based on the scientific process as it is now undertaken; they cannot plausibly be considered science‐​based.



As for EPA’s June proposed rule asking whether it should issue regulations setting standards for how it performs requisite cost‐​benefit analyses, my answer is a resounding “yes.”



There has been so little consistency in how EPA has chosen to calculate regulatory benefits that the exercise has often seemed much less an actual objective analysis and much more an attempt to find any methodology which results in estimated benefits big enough to justify a proposed rule using cost‐​benefit analysis.



Many examples of this inconsistent cost‐​benefit analysis advocacy exist. In the case of the 2010 CAFE standards, EPA rejected a large number of economic studies showing that consumers did not attach high value to increased mileage, choosing instead to multiply an estimate of reduced gallons of gas consumed by the estimate price of gasoline. The latter approach, which uses estimates of future miles driven and gasoline prices that are subject to enormous uncertainty, had the apparent virtue of increasing the value of the CAFE standard.



A few years later, around 2011, EPA initially proposed to value alternative approaches to regulating power plant cooling water intake by simply asking people how much they would hypothetically pay to protect various fish populations and aquatic ecosystems. These contingent valuation surveys attempt to elicit stated preferences, not preferences revealed by the actual choices people make. Many economists who do not make a living running these surveys believe that they do not reliably measure people’s actual willingness to pay for anything.



Finally, in many of its Obama‐​era greenhouse gas regulations, including the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which set guidelines for states to follow in ending electric utility generation from coal‐​burning power plants, the biggest EPA‐​calculated benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions was the lower Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). But those SCC estimates assumed that people are very limited in their ability to adapt to climate change. Recent work has proven this assumption to be fabulously wrong as indeed it had to be, since if humans could not adapt to differing climates, our species should have vanished with the onset of the Holocene, the Netherlands should not exist, and American settlers should have failed to establish agriculture on the Great Plains.



The only standards that EPA has seemed to apply consistently in doing cost‐​benefit analysis are to choose whatever approach generates the largest regulatory benefits and to obfuscate rather than fully disclose the uncertainty of its estimated benefits and the dependence of those estimates on certain, and often questionable, underlying methodological choices. EPA should issue regulations setting guidelines for how it will estimate both regulatory benefits and costs, specifying that certain methodologies—such as stated preference estimates from contingent valuation—will be disfavored as unreliable.



These regulations should also establish consistency in how EPA deals with wide variation and uncertainty in estimates. In the tailpipe rule, EPA did not use any empirical estimates of consumers’ revealed market preference for increased gas mileage, explaining that it ignored those because there was too much variation in reported estimates. In getting an SCC estimate, by contrast, an Interagency Working Group generated an SCC estimate for EPA’s use despite enormous variation in estimated SCC—with estimates ranging from large negative SCCs, that is, net benefits from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, to positive SCCs in the hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon dioxide. The Interagency Working Group reported SCC estimates from three models with particular assumptions—most importantly, assuming very limited ability to adapt to future climate change.



EPA should by regulation specify how it would treat uncertainty in estimated regulatory benefits: If some studies are to be given weight while others are ignored, EPA must clearly explain which general scientific principles determine the weighting choice. Only through such regulatory guidance can EPA end its practice of ignoring uncertainty when doing so allows it to choose studies that support large regulatory benefits and dismiss studies with very low estimated benefits that weaken the case for regulation.



A particular topic that EPA’s cost‐​benefit analysis regulations should address is how it will calculate the total benefits of reducing one pollutant—call it pollutant A—when the actions taken to reduce that pollutant also reduce the levels of another pollutant—call it pollutant B—that is also regulated directly. This is known as the “co‐​benefits” problem in cost‐​benefit analysis, with the co‐​benefits being the reduction in pollutant B that arise from regulations targeting pollutant A.



Take ozone as pollutant A and fine PM as pollutant B. EPA’s regulation on cost‐​benefit analysis should clearly specify that in calculating the total benefits from reducing ozone, side benefits from reducing fine PM should be counted in the cost‐​benefit analysis only if the reductions in fine PM—due to the reductions in ozone—have been credibly established to be over and above those achieved by regulating fine PM directly. If this is not done, and, for example, the benefits of regulations targeted at reducing fine PM directly are added as an indirect benefit of regulations targeted at reducing other pollutants, then benefits of reducing the other pollutants may be vastly overestimated. New EPA regulations should clearly set out that benefits from reducing pollutant B should be included as a co‐​benefit of reducing pollutant A only to the extent that reductions in pollutant B have been credibly established to result solely from the new regulation under consideration.



EPA’s rulemakings have increasingly been based on statistical analysis that has never been subject to rigorous testing and critique, and its cost‐​benefit analysis on oftentimes unreliable economic methods. The two rules proposed by EPA during the summer of 2018 can do much to restore the scientific and economic integrity of EPA regulations.

As many people have remarked, whatever you think of her politics, Hanson has guts and persistence. In the lead-up to the last election, Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party endured an astonishing barrage of hatchet-jobs and gotchas. The legacy media often seemed to be working hand-in-glove with underhanded political operators, especially with the series of secret video recordings made by a Qatari-linked fake lobbying organisation.



A recurrent tactic by the political left is to try and shove One Nation right out of the Overton Window, shrieking that their policies are beyond the pale of allowable (by the left) public discourse. Then, any political party that even **looks** like cutting a preference deal with One Nation is smeared by association. This is a gambit by the left to firstly, try and starve One Nation out of parliament, and to secondly nobble the Coalition by denying them One Nation preferences.



Yet, as post-election analysis shows, the scaremongering by Labor and the Greens is just another election campaign lie.



None of the Coalition’s Queensland MPs needed more than 50 per cent of One Nation preferences to win their seat at the May 18 election.



In fact, it was Labor who relied on the Greens.



In contrast, Greens preferences helped secure victories at the May election for 13 Labor MPs who were in losing ­positions before the final allocation of preferences.



The only real effect of One Nation in Queensland, where Labor was all but wiped out, was simply to boost the Coalition’s winning margin.



Analysis by The Australian of newly released Australian Electoral Commission data shows that in 12 Queensland seats ultimately won by the Coalition and where Pauline Hanson’s party finished third, the government had secured 50 per cent of the vote or was leading Labor before One Nation preferences were distributed. Although One Nation preferences did not cost any Labor candidate victory in Queensland, preference flows from Senator Hanson’s party to the Coalition of up to 73 per cent did help to boost the LNP candidates’ winning margins.



During the election campaign, Labor campaigned strongly on One Nation preferences, warning votes for the party would deliver the Coalition victory.



So, about as truthful as any of their other scare campaigns, like the notorious “Mediscare” campaign of 2016. The truth is that Labor is being led by the nose by the Greens whose preferences they desperately need. Meanwhile, traditional Labor voters are turning to One Nation, who increasingly stand for the blue-collar values Labor have abandoned. Hanson’s campaign slogan was particularly enticing to formerly rusted-on Labor voters: **We’ve got the guts to say what you’re thinking**. Labor’s obsession with right-on “progressive” nostrums like climate change, asylum seekers and the nuttiest fringes of rainbow activism might play well in the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, but the party needs to remember that there is a whole other nation outside the quinoa-proof fence.



Liberal National senator James McGrath said the analysis showed the difficulty Mr Albanese would have in shifting Labor’s agenda to the centre. “This shows Labor cannot win without Greens preferences, which is why Labor keep tacking to the left policy-wise,” Senator McGrath said. “The lesson from 2019 was to listen to the quiet Australians. This shows for Labor to win they have to listen to the Greens.”



The Green tail wagging the Labor dog: a familiar story.

"As notorious weather predictions go, the “barbecue summer” of 2009 is up there with Michael Fish’s dismissal of the incoming 1987 hurricane. The summer turned out to be wet and windy, and questions were subsequently raised as to whether reliable seasonal forecasts were worthwhile, or even possible. Seasonal forecasts are constructed by integrating many complex numerical climate models, which encode the laws of physics as they apply to the climate system. Forecasts provide estimates of seasonal averages of weather conditions, typically up to three months ahead, and so provide an idea of how likely a forthcoming season will be wetter, drier, warmer, or colder than normal. These forecasts have to be considered probabilistic, rather than deterministic. The chaotic nature of the climate system, with its strong sensitivity to initial conditions (also known as the “butterfly effect”) makes accurate long-term deterministic forecasts impossible. And inevitably, the approximate nature of all weather and climate models introduces a degree of inaccuracy. For example, the microphysical processes that occur in the formation of clouds at micrometre scales cannot be directly described by our climate models, which are typically constructed of millions of grid boxes, or nodes, of approximately 100km length. Seasonal forecasts are increasingly used for forward planning purposes, such as by the government, emergency agencies, the water industry, and agriculture. Information about seasonal average rainfall and temperature for the growing season can inform a farmer’s decision about which type of crop to plant ahead of time, for example. But this information is only useful if it is reliable, and it is impossible to generate an idea of reliability from a single probabilistic forecast. So the Met Office’s forecast of a barbecue summer for 2009 cannot really be said to have been “right” or “wrong” by itself. And after all, the Met’s Chief Metereologist Ewen McCallum did predict a 20% chance of a washout alongside a 50% chance of above-average temperatures – hence “odds on” for sun.  However, the reliability of a series of probabilistic forecasts can be quantified in a meaningful way. For example, examining a set of predictions over 30 years or so, if the forecasting system is reliable then the predictions will broadly match the facts. Predictions of a warm season with an 80% forecast probability of high temperatures will have been correct 80% of the time (and wrong 20% of the time). If a forecasting system is unreliable in this sense, then people can be misled – perhaps into making unfortunate barbecue-related decisions. In our paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface we developed objective criteria for classifying weather forecast reliability, from perfect reliability (5) and useful reliability (4), through a marginally useful category (3), to those defined as not useful (2) or even dangerously useless (1).  We used seasonal forecasts from one of the world leading centres in weather and seasonal forecasts, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) based in Reading, to estimate the degree of reliability of temperature and precipitation forecasts during summer and winter for all land regions around the world. Our proposed classification is based on the reliability curve in a so-called reliability diagram. The reliability curve describes the statistical relationship between the forecast probabilities and the statistical frequency with which these events actually happened.  If the curve (within some margin of error) indicates a perfect relationship between the forecasts and observations, we classify these forecasts as 5. In contrast, a flat reliability curve, demonstrating little correlation between forecast probabilities and observations, means that the forecasts are irrelevant for the seasonal climate conditions and we classify these cases as 2. So how good are seasonal forecasts these days? There is no simple answer – they fall into a wide range of reliability rankings, depending on the region, the season, and whether we look at temperature or rainfall forecasts. Many fall into the perfect reliability category 5 for temperature, for example mild winters in Australia and Southern South America, warm summers over parts of North America, while summer forecasts of rainfall over Northern Europe including in Britain perform extremely badly. In fact, for this region we found that the more likely a dry summer appears in the forecasts, the less likely it is to come to pass in the real world.  The fact is we still have some way to go before we can provide reliable seasonal weather forecasts. The key to improving reliability in the future will be our ability to understand and represent physical processes more accurately. One way to improve the forecasts is to run the models at finer resolution, thus allowing the most important cloud systems to be represented explicitly in the models. But this will require much more powerful supercomputers than are currently available.  Another approach is to represent the uncertainties inherent within the model within the model’s equations themselves. This can be done by incorporating random processes within the model equations. While it may seem paradoxical that adding random noise to a climate model can actually lead to more accurate and reliable forecasts, increasingly this is what our research is telling us."

Then in the 1970s the sea ice at the Arctic recovered and the globe again struggled with bitterly cold and long winters. Immediately scientists issued dire warnings of a coming potential ice age, like Newsweek reported in 1974:

 Newsweek, April 28, 1974.
Later in the 1990s, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation had swung back to their warm phases and they reheated the planet, like a bathtub with hot water warms a bathroom. The global temperature jumped a half degree and the panic quickly switched, this time back to global warming and melting Arctic – just like we what we had seen in the 1940s and 50s. And this time environmental activists seized the opportunity and tried to blame it all on human CO2 emissions. The UN set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and governments worldwide committed trillions of our tax money to fight nature by holding profligate conferences and inventing schemes to control human behavior.

But then in the 2000s the planet unexpectedly refused to warm up further, which left many scientists stumped and clueless. Finally over the last years, signs of a cooling planet have been mounting and becoming impossible to deny. Today we see the first scientists bolting for the back door. Just yesterday renown climate scientist Professor Mike Lockwood of Reading University told the world through the BBC that we are possibly looking at “a new mini ice age“.
It’s back to global cooling – climate science is now going back 40 years to the headlines of the 1970s!
So quickly are they able to turn on a dime.
If anything has become clear since the release of the IPCC 5th Assessment Report released last month, it is that climate science has collapsed into a state of complete confusion. It is very clear that they now have no idea where the climate is headed and never before has the science found itself in such a state of open dispute.
Politicians take note!

UPDATE: January 1st, 2012 – still here, no reports of mass deaths at the last minute. – Anthony
Global warming may go on a last minute rampage. Maybe best to just stay at home and lock your doors, bar your windows, and turn your air conditioner on. If you live near the coast, head for high ground. Deaths due to drinking and  driving will be nothing compared to this.
This story appeared in The Canadian January 8th, 2007, it’s been a countdown example of stupidity ever since. Unbelievably, it is still on their website. Note today’s date.


Over at the Daily Bayonet, where they’ve been following for this for years, they have encouraging news:
Assuming there is no last minute surprise attack by pesky methane clathrates, the Daily Bayonet wishes you a safe and happy 2012.
If it happens, it will be the gaia fart heard round the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFeeding-In Wind Energy In April: An Expensive Game
By the European Institute for Climate and Energy (Germany)
(Translated, edited and supplemented by P Gosselin)
April is almost over and the ever more expensive German EEG Energy Feed-In Act is celebrated day after day by politicians, most of the media, and the many benefactors of receiving subsidies from the consumer.

Figure 1: Wind energy feed-in in Germany from April 1 – 25, 2013. Total installed rated capacity is 32,000 MW. Peak output reached 18,000 MW briefly on April 18. On April 25, the wind turbines practically stood still. Overall output for April reached only about a measly 15% of rated capacity. Source: EIKE reader Ralf Schuster.
These billions represent transfers from the poor to the rich. In Germany the EEG feed-in act was once viewed as a man-on-the-moon project, and was compared to the reunification of Germany – as German Environment Minister Peter Altmaier has stated time and again [1]. The installation of wind and solar power plants continues unabated, even as resistance to landscapes littered by wind turbines continues to grow and the brakes against rapidly increasing electricity prices have failed [2].
Now is a good time to ask just how much energy have wind turbines contributed in Germany in April? It’s time to take a closer look.
So far up to today, 32,000 megawatts of wind turbine capacity have been installed in Germany. This amount of wind capacity is about equivalent to about 30 nuclear reactors, which environmentalists often like to mention. The fact that this is not true is known only by very few people. For this reason we would like to briefly illustrate the reality of wind energy in Germany. The true reality looks completely different.
Figure 1 [3] above is a chart showing wind energy feed-in from all German windparks and their turbines for April so far. Recall that a total of 32 gigawatts of capacity have been installed. A peak of 17 gigawatts of power was briefly fed in on April 18, yet this was stillm a far cry from full capacity.
The total electrical energy consumption by Germany during the first 25 days was approximately 33 terawatt-hrs. That translates to an average of 55 gigawatts of power every hour. If the wind turbines had operated at 100% capacity for the entire time, they still would have only supplied 60% of Germany’s needed power. However, wind turbines rarely run near 100% rated capacity. Very often they produce only a small fraction of their rated capacity because the wind is highly variable and often does not blow very hard. On April 18 wind turbines in Germany produced their peak for the month: 17 gigawatts, but only for about 2 hours, before rapidly dropping off again to 8 GW at around midnight. On that day, all wind turbines together briefly reached 53% of their rated capacity. And that was their best day.
On most other days the performance of the wind turbines in Germany is far worse. On five days the power output reached only 4 GW, with a minimum of just over zero on April 25. During these relatively windless 5 days, the turbines operated at only 12% of their rated capacity of 32 gigawatts, which is only 7.3 % of Germany’s 55 gigawatts average hourly consumption.

Figure 2: Shows the electricity feed-in for 25 April, 2013. At about 10 a.m. wind power from turbines dropped to only 184 megawatts. Source: EEX-Leipzig.
Figure 2 clearly illustrates the completely miserable performance. Before noon, when demand for electricty reaches its peak, the feed-in by wind turbines was only at 184 megawatts, which is a puny 0.3 % of the power that is needed in Germany. Power feed-in by wind turbines on April 25 reached their maximum of only 4.8 gigawatts at midnight – power that nobody needs and perhaps it can be “sold” to a foreign market at a negative price (something that actually does occur nowadays).
This expensive, wildly fluctuating feed-in behavior of course has to be balanced out by coal, nuclear, and the ever increasingly more important gas-fired power plants. However, such power plants often find themselves running at a fraction of their capacity, i.e. at a range that is completely inefficient. When the wind blows and the sun shines, they slow right down to idle, and thus lose lots of money.
The most modern gas-fired power plant is the GUD power plant in Irrsching, which went online a year ago. It has an efficiency of about 60% when it runs near full capacity, which should be every hour of the year. But it doesn’t. To make a profit, it would need to run at least 4000 hours annually. But because renewable energy like wind and sun have priority when it comes to being feed-in into the power grid, the GUD gas plant operates only about 1600 hours per year. Therefore it is a money-loser, one that ought to be shut down. But it can’t because it always has to be on standby, ready to jump in should the wind and sun fail to deliver.
Lo and behold, poliitcians have found a solution. German Free Democrat Party (FDP) Minister Martin Zeil knows how to rescue the plant, as the daily Augsburger Allgemeinen writes:
The plant operators have announced that the plant will be shut down at least 2 years. About 100 million euros are needed to keep the power plant running said company chairman Teyssen…
…Bavaria Economics Minsister Martin Zeil declared a few days ago that Irsching V has to stay online. Otherwise grid stability and thus the electricity supply would be jeopardized. Because of this the grid operator can instruct to keep a power plant on standby, the Minister reminds. Moreover, Zeil said the state government is planning the construction of 4 new gas-fired power plants, but is unable to find an investor. Irsching V can produce almost as much electricity as a small nuclear reactor…Bavaria’s showcase power plant risks going out of business.
…continue reading at the Augsburger-Allgemeine. Keeping unprofitable plants on standby is a massive expense that will be paid by the poor consumer.
This is what Germany’s Energiewende (energy transformation to renewables) looks like to the rest of the world.

At the Iowa State Fair “Uncle” Joe Biden proved he is simply not fit to run for the office of the American President when he told the crowd “we choose truth over facts”. He has a problem with either his brain or his mouth or both, but his slip of the tongue may in fact be the truth.



Obviously, our Green party would totally support Uncle Joe because they also believe truth trumps facts when it comes to climate change, marijuana, farming and conservation. They know some truths are indisputable regardless of the facts.



Would you buy what this man is selling? And can you imagine what he might mistakenly say to Kim Jong-un or Vladimir Putin?



Far be it from me, a person of the wrong country, sex, age and race to talk about the suitability of candidates for the American president, but Biden has serious competition for the title of the “ ~~most senile~~ worst candidate ever”. 



His competition is Bernie Sanders – also at the Iowa State Fair, which was obviously the best place to be last weekend for political candidate entertainment.



Staffers for the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reportedly roughed up members of the press during his visit to the Iowa State Fair on Sunday.



A campaign staffer for Bernie Sanders was screamed at by a local photojournalist who was repeatedly shoved following the Vermont senator’s remarks at the Iowa State Fair.



The confrontation erupted after members of the campaign relentlessly pushed the local journalists to make room for Sanders as he made his way to various attractions at the fair on Sunday.



 **The press pool erupted in chaos as Sanders left** the campaign event, which was hosted by the _Des Moines Register_.



“Do not put your hands on me. You keep pushing me,” the female photographer yelled at the staffer.



Simonson added: “One staffer for the Des Moines Register pushed a gate into a reporter for the Washington Examiner after telling him that ‘ **not all press’ would be allowed to follow Sanders around.”**



The leadup to the US elections is going to be just as interesting as our own.

"A Japanese jeans maker has found a new way of capitalising on zoo animals. Zoo Jeans are producing jeans “designed by dangerous animals”. Denim is wrapped around tyres, which are then thrown to the lions who enjoy ripping and biting at the material. This produces that all-important designer, distressed look. Rather than simply being a marketing gimic, there is actually value in this from an animal welfare perspective. Involving lions and the zoo’s other large carnivores in the activity is part of what’s called environmental enrichment. This is the provision of stimuli to help improve well-being. It’s a win-win activity for many zoos, who can make alternative profits from their animals, which tend to be used to provide extra facilities for them. Wrapping denim around a tyre to make enrichment devices for toothy carnivores is just one way that zoos have profited from their animals’ hobbies over the years. Since their inception, zoos have looked for different ways to fund their activities. London Zoo when it first opened would let in penniless visitors for a cat or dog to be fed to the carnivores. Visitors with money were offered other things to keep themselves amused as they looked at the animals. One popular activity at zoos has been elephant rides, which expanded out to other animals. The Artis Zoo in Amsterdam used to offer paying visitors ostrich rides until one day when the ostrich took off with a hapless visitor on its back. The ride only ended some 10 miles from the zoo when the ostrich collapsed from exhaustion. These days, animal welfare and human safety regulations have rightly put an end to such animal rides in many countries. Zoo Jeans’ use of zoo animals in its design process is not the first creative role that animals have played. Chimpanzees and elephants have been given paint brushes and blank canvases to create their own artwork. Perhaps the most famous example is Congo the chimpanzee, an artist admired by Pablo Picasso. He was introduced to art by zoologist Desmond Morris and, since his death, London Zoo has sold pieces by him for more than US$25,000. There has even been a chimpanzee art competition. I for one support this activity as the stimulus involved is enriching for the animals involved and the money made is fed back into their welfare.  Many zoos around the world have found a lucrative market in collecting the faeces of large carnivores for gardeners or foresters. Funnily enough, this isn’t a kind of luxury fertiliser. In fact, it’s to repel the small carnivores that roam our streets. Domestic cats and foxes communicate their presence in a territory by marking it with faeces and they recognise when this has been done by another member of their species or another carnivore. The system is like traffic lights, if the faecal matter of another individual or large carnivore is new then small predators read this as a red light but if it is old then it is green for go.  Thus, gardeners can spread lion or leopard dung around the borders of their garden to keep out unwanted small carnivores such as the neighbour’s moggy. Foresters can use this dung in a similar manner to protect trees from deer damage. But obviously the process needs to be frequently repeated; happily most zoos have a constant supply of said material. A number of zoos have now gone into attracting corporate business clients and one of the things that always sells is team-building activities. Companies are given the task of building environmental enrichment devices for the zoo animal of their choice. The team has to choose an animal, observe it and then build it the object of its dreams. Once built, the newly made enrichment device is safety checked by a zookeeper, before being sent down the animal enclosure’s chimney.   Playing the role of Father Christmas for a giant anteater is more fun and challenging than you can imagine. Having spent much of my career working on environmental enrichment, I can tell you it is one of the most rewarding activities you can undertake with captive animals. It can also play an important role in helping revive zoos that are in decline.  Zoo Jeans are auctioning off their creations, with all profits going toward preserving the environment at their local zoo and the WWF."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA has released its latest sea ice report. These are tough times for climate alarmists. The truth is: There’s a lot more sea ice out there this year than they ever imagined.

NASA makes some interesting comments.
First they tell us that Arctic sea ice is over 1.5 million sq. km above last year, and is thus at one of the highest late summer extents in the last 10 years. Surprise.
Secondly Walt Meier of NASA tells us the real reason for last year’s record minimum: storms. Walt Meier (my emphasis):

Last year’s storm went across an area of open water and mixed the smaller pieces of ice with the relatively warm water, so it melted very rapidly. This year, the storms hit in an area of more consolidated ice. The storms this year were more typical summer storms; last year’s was the unusual one.”
Thirdly, NASA seems stumped by the near record extent of Antarctic sea ice (my emphasis):
Antarctic sea ice, which is in the midst of its yearly growing cycle, is heading toward the largest extent on record, having reached 7.45 million square miles (19.3 million square kilometers) on Aug. 21.  […] The phenomenon, which appears counter-intuitive but reflects the differences in environment and climate between the Arctic and Antarctica, is currently the subject of many research studies.”
One can’t help notice in NASA’s language that ice melt to them means warming, but ice forming is because of weather, a phenomena, or something. God forbid it may be a sign of cooling.
Finally, NASA likes to convey to readers and pretend that the sea ice decrease in the Arctic over the last 35 years is linear, and likely will continue so. But the fact is that Arctic sea ice extent is cyclic, and that it has flattened in the last 6 years, and the reversals of the PDO and AMO likely have something to do with it.

Chairman Gallegly, Ranking Member Lofgren, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting the Cato Institute to testify today on the subject of worksite enforcement of U.S. immigration law. The Cato Institute is a non‐​profit, non‐​partisan educational institution dedicated to promoting understanding of public policies based on the principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited, Constitutional government. As the director the Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, I’ve been researching and writing about trade and immigration policy since joining Cato in 1997.



All of us in this room share the policy goals of reducing illegal immigration, securing our borders against those who would do us harm, and creating jobs for U.S. workers through a growing economy. With those goals firmly in mind, I believe that focusing primarily on worksite enforcement will continue to be an expensive and damaging distraction until we reform our immigration laws to reflect the underlying realities of America’s 21st‐​century labor market.



Our policy of relying solely on enforcement of existing law to reduce illegal immigration has failed. This is true for both border and interior enforcement. Since 1992, the U.S. Border Patrol’s annual budget has shot up by 714 percent, from $326 million to $2.7 billion, while the number of Border Patrol agents stationed along the southwest border has grown five‐​fold, from 3,555 to 17,415.1 Meanwhile, since the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, U.S. employers have been subject to fines for knowingly hiring undocumented workers. Interior enforcement of those laws has waxed and waned and waxed again over the years. In the late 1990s, the Clinton administration raided hundreds of workplaces and detained thousands of illegal workers. More recently the Bush administration ramped up deportations in 2007 and now the Obama administration has rounded up and deported record numbers of illegal immigrants.2



Yet during two decades of more vigorous enforcement at the border and at the worksite, the number of illegal immigrants in the country has roughly tripled, from 4 million to 11 million. Imagine the complaints we would rightfully hear about a federal education program in which spending and personnel had grown dramatically, and yet the problem it was supposed to solve had gotten far worse. The right response would be to change our approach, not to keep throwing more money and personnel into a broken system hoping for a better result.



 **Economic and Demographic Realities Drive Immigration**  
Our enforcement‐​only approach is at odds with the underlying economic and demographic realities of our dynamic American economy. Low‐​skilled immigration to the United States, both legal and illegal, is driven by basic forces of demand and supply.



On the demand side, our economy continues to create hundreds of thousands of net new jobs each year that require only short‐​term, on‐​the‐​job training. Of course, the Great Recession of 2007-09 put a temporary halt to net job creation, but as our economic recovery and expansion continue, the long‐​term demand for low‐​skilled workers will continue to rise. According to recent projections by the U.S. Department of Labor, hundreds of thousands of net new jobs will be created during the next decade for home health aides, food preparation and serving workers, retail salespersons, landscaping and groundskeeping workers, and waiters and waitresses.4



At the same time, the number of Americans who have traditionally filled such jobs continues to shrink. American workers, on average, are becoming older and better educated and thus less willing to fill those jobs. The number of adult Americans in the work force without a high school diploma has dropped by 3 million in the past decade, and that trend will likely continue.5 According to projections by the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of workers age 16–24, another group that has traditionally filled less‐​skilled jobs, will shrink by 900,000 by 2018.6



Immigrants fill the growing gap between expanding low‐​skilled jobs and the shrinking pool of native‐​born Americans who would want such jobs. Immigrant workers enable important sectors of the U.S. economy to continue to grow and meet the needs of their customers. By facilitating the growth of such sectors as retail, agriculture, landscaping, restaurants, and hotels, low‐​skilled immigrants have enabled those sectors to expand, attract investment, and create middle‐​class jobs in management, design and engineering, bookkeeping, marketing and other areas that employ native‐​born Americans. 



More broadly, our nation is undergoing a demographic downshift with enormous implications. The 2010 Census figures that were just released show the slowest population growth in the past decade since the 1930s. Without immigration, our workforce would soon begin to shrink, reducing our potential economic growth and our weight and influence in the global economy. Without a steady, continuing growth in our workforce, it will be even more difficult to fund Social Security and Medicare payments to the army of Baby Boomers who are already beginning to retire. Immigration has played an important role in allowing our workforce to continue a healthy if slowing rate of growth. 



It may produce a good sound bite but it is misleading to assert that every low‐​skilled immigrant we can round up and deport will mean a job for an unemployed American. The real world economy doesn’t work that way. Low‐​skilled immigrants, whether legal or illegal, do not compete directly with the large majority of American workers. American companies hire immigrant workers to fill millions of low‐​skilled jobs because there are simply not enough American workers willing to fill those same jobs. The pay and working conditions for many of these jobs do not match the qualifications and aspirations of the large majority of Americans currently looking for employment in our recovering economy.



Consider the agricultural sector, in which an estimated 800,000 to 1 million undocumented immigrants work each year to harvest American crops. Does anybody seriously believe that if we could deport every one of those workers tomorrow, that a sufficient number of American workers would line up to take their place? It’s safe to say most of those jobs would go unfilled. If wages were hiked significantly, many of those jobs would simply disappear, most likely to be replaced by imported farm goods grown and harvested in other countries. 



Without immigrant workers, the most likely scenario is that we would simply produce less agricultural output as a nation. This would mean not only a direct loss of manual, on‐​the‐​farm jobs but a ripple effect of job losses in upstream and downstream sectors such as management, processing, packaging, distribution, and marketing. According to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there are 3.1 related jobs off the farm for every job on the farm. Eliminating the on‐​farm jobs would put at risk many more jobs paying middle‐​class wages and employing native‐​born American workers. 



**Immigration and Employment**  
We cannot enforce our way out of unemployment. There is no causal relationship between inflows of immigration and higher overall unemployment in the U.S. economy. In fact, the causation usually runs the other way: immigrants tend to come in greater numbers during periods of low unemployment when jobs are plentiful, and the numbers tend to decline when unemployment rises. That is the main reason why the number of illegal immigrants in the United States has actually fallen by an estimated 1 million since 2007, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.7 Incremental changes in enforcement cannot account for such a sharp drop in the number of undocumented workers in the United States. The most plausible major explanation is the economic downturn in the U.S. labor market that began at the end of 2007 and persisted into 2010. 



When it comes to employment, immigrants complement the large majority of American workers rather than compete against them. Immigrants help to create job opportunities for native‐​born workers by starting businesses, attracting investment, and allowing important sectors of the economy to expand, creating opportunities higher up the skills ladder. 



It is an especially pernicious myth that low‐​skilled immigrants harm the employment prospects of African Americans. As with most other Americans, few African Americans compete directly with immigrant workers. In what was probably the most thorough economic study of U.S. immigration ever, the 1997 report of the National Research Council, titled _The New Americans_ , came to the conclusion that: 



None of the available evidence on spatial correlations suggests that in the aggregate the economic opportunities of black Americans are substantially reduced by immigration. … Some black workers have lost their jobs to immigrants, especially when they live in a place with a large concentration of immigrants. But the vast majority do not live in such places, and their economic opportunities are determined by other things.  
  
Those “other things” include the quality of education, local crime rates, and the overall business climate. I would humbly suggest to the Committee members that improving any or all of those other things would do far more to enhance the economic opportunities of American workers than beefed up worksite enforcement against the hiring of low‐​skilled immigrants.8



My own research at the Cato Institute shows that the growth of Hispanic immigration has not had a negative effect on lower‐​income African Americans. In fact, the evidence from the past 20 years shows that as immigrants have moved in, native‐​born Americans, including African Americans, have generally moved up. From 1994 through 2007, the number of illegal immigrants in the United States more than doubled, from an estimated 4.5 million to 11 million. During that same period, the number of African Americans living below the poverty line dropped by 1.6 million.



During that same period of rising low‐​skilled immigration, we also witnessed an encouraging decline in the number of adult Americans toiling without a high‐​school diploma. From 1993 through 2006, the number of adults 25 and older without a high school diploma declined from 32.1 million to 27.9 million, a fall of 4.2 million. That includes a drop of 1 million in the number of adult African Americans without a diploma.9 Clearly, rising numbers of low‐​skilled immigrants have not prevented African Americans from improving their skills and lifting themselves out of poverty.



Immigration itself may have helped to spur the advancement of millions of Americans to improve their employment prospects and earnings potential in the past two decades. The arrival of low‐​skilled foreign‐​born workers in the labor force increases the incentives for younger native‐​born Americans to stay in school and for older workers to upgrade their skills. 



Immigrants do compete directly with a small subset of American workers, typically those without a high school diploma. But the addition of low‐​skilled immigrants also expands the size of the overall economy, creating openings in higher‐​paid occupations such as managers, skilled craftsmen, and accountants. The result is a greater financial reward for finishing high school and for acquiring additional job skills. Low‐​skilled immigration motivates Americans who might otherwise languish in the underclass to acquire the education and skills necessary so they are not competing directly with foreign‐​born workers.



The large majority of economists across the political spectrum agree that immigration is good for our economy. It increases the incomes of the large majority of Americans while boosting overall economic growth. Evidence is growing that immigration has a modestly positive impact on the wages of the large majority of American workers, and a modestly negative impact on the small and shrinking minority of adult American workers without a high‐​school diploma. 



The 1997 National Research Council study concluded that immigration boosts the income of American workers overall by as much as $10 billion, but that it does slightly reduce the wages of the lowest skilled Americans. As the NRC concluded, “The weight of empirical evidence suggest that the impact of immigration on the wages of competing native born workers is small — possibly reducing them by only 1 or 2 percent.“10 More recent studies have confirmed this effect. For example, in a 2006 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Ottaviano and Peri estimated that immigration from 1990 to 2004 had reduced the wages of Americans without a high school diploma by 1 to 2 percent, while boosting the wages of the more than 90 percent of American adults with a high‐​school education by 0.7 percent in the short run and 1.8 percent in the long run.



Immigrants have a relatively small impact on the wages of native born workers for at least three major reasons: One, immigrants tend to bring a different set of skills and differing preferences for the kind of work they perform compared to native‐​born workers, which means immigrants are less easily substituted for their native‐​born counterparts. Two, by increasing the size the labor force, immigrants tend to boost the returns to capital, stimulating more investment in the economy and thus raising the productivity and wages of all workers, including the native‐​born. Three, for all the political hype over immigration, the number of immigrants and their output continue to be modest compared to the overall size of a U.S. economy that employs close to 150 million workers and produces more than $14 trillion in output a year.



 **The Economic Benefits of Legalization**  
Allowing more low‐​skilled immigrants to legalize would have a positive effect not only on the immigrants themselves but on native‐​born workers on the lower end of the skill ladder. We know from experience after the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that newly legalized workers are more likely to upgrade their job and language skills, raising their productivity and wages. Legalized workers also enjoy more bargaining power in the marketplace, and are far more likely to be employed “on the books,” resulting in better pay. A 1996 Labor Department study found that real wages paid to undocumented workers were flat for most of the decade until 1987–88, but then rose 15 percent in the five years following legalization.11 Legalization means that native‐​born and legal immigrants are no longer required to compete with an underground labor supply. 



If anything, more aggressive enforcement against low‐​skilled immigration will arguably have a negative impact on our economy and the incomes of American households. Removing millions of low‐​skilled workers from our labor force through enforcement would impact our economy in a number of negative ways: It would reduce incentives for investment in the affected industries. It would reduce the relative job openings in more skilled positions in those industries, reducing employment for native‐​born Americans. Less investment and employment in the affected sectors would in turn reduce government revenue. 



A 2009 Cato study by Dixon and Rimmer estimated the economy‐​wide effects of enhanced border enforcement and interior enforcement, as well as different versions of legalization through immigration reform. The authors used a general‐​equilibrium model that they have developed for the U.S. Homeland Security Department, the U.S. Agriculture Department, and the U.S. International Trade Commission. In a study titled, “Restriction or Legalization,” Dixon and Rimmer estimated that more aggressive interior enforcement that resulted in a 30 percent reduction in low‐​skilled immigration to the United States would cause a drop in the incomes of American households of 0.45 percent — or $64 billion a year. In contrast, the same study estimated that immigration reform that allowed more low‐​skilled immigrants to enter the United States legally could boost the incomes of American families by $180 billion a year.12 A 2010 study by the Center for American Progress confirmed the magnitude of the potential gains, concluding that legalization would boost incomes by $189 billion a year once fully implemented.13



The best approach to reducing illegal immigration would be to expand opportunities for legal immigration while targeting enforcement against terrorists, criminals and others who continue to operate outside the system.



If foreign‐​born workers were allowed to enter the country through a safe, orderly and legal path, the number choosing to enter illegally would drop sharply. When given the choice of paying a smuggler $2,000, risking robbery and death in the desert, and living a shadowy existence in the underground U.S. economy, unable to leave and return freely to visit home, or entering the United States across a legal port of entry with legal documents, enjoying the full responsibility and protection of the law, and the freedom to visit home without fear of being denied re‐​entry, the large majority of potential entrants will choose the legal path.



We know from experience that legal immigration, if allowed, will crowd out illegal immigration. Here we can learn two valuable lessons from the _Bracero_ program, which allowed Mexican workers to enter the United States temporarily from 1942 to 1964, typically to work on farms in the Southwest. One lesson is that temporary workers should be given maximum mobility to change employers. The fatal flaw of the _Bracero_ program is that it tied workers to specific employers as a condition of the visa. This gave too much leverage to employers, resulting in abuses which lead Congress to shut down the program.



The more positive lesson from the _Bracero_ program is that, for all its shortcomings, it did provide a legal alternative to illegal immigration. Early in the 1950s, illegal immigration was widespread because the program offered an insufficient number of visas to meet the labor demands of a growing U.S. economy. Instead of merely redoubling efforts to enforce a flawed law, Congress dramatically increased the number of visas to accommodate demand. The result: Apprehensions of illegal entrants at the border soon dropped by more than 90 percent. Back then, as we could expect now, foreign‐​born workers rationally chose the legal path to entry when it was available. When the _Bracero_ program was abolished in 1964, illegal immigration began an inexorable rise that has continued to the present time.



Legalization would not necessarily mean a significant increase in the number of low‐​skilled immigrant workers in the U.S. economy, but instead the replacement of an undocumented workforce with a documented workforce. Legalization would allow the U.S. government to more effectively monitor and manage who was entering the United States for employment. Although the number of immigrant workers is ultimately determined by demand in the labor market, the federal government could regulate the number of visas depending on the unemployment rate and the business cycle. One tool of regulation could be changing visa fees to better match the supply of temporary foreign‐​born workers with domestic demand. 



A program of legalization would transform the enforcement debate. Instead of wasting resources in a futile effort to root out millions of low‐​skilled immigrant workers who are productively contributing to our nation’s economy, we could focus our enforcement efforts on apprehending terrorists and other real criminals. Large‐​scale illegal immigration will end only when America’s immigration system offers a legal alternative consistent with the underlying realities of our labor market.

A good default proposition regarding the government’s role in the economy would state that the government should not loan money to an enterprise if the enterprise in question cannot find one single market actor anywhere in the universe to loan said enterprise a single red cent. It might suggest – I don’t know – that the investment is rather … dubious.   
  
Alas, like all good propositions regarding the government’s role in the economy, this one is being left by the roadside by the Obama administration. Unfortunately, the only complaint being made by a not insubstantial segment of the political Right – frequently, the political crowd that is busy decrying “Bailout Nation” – is that the loan guarantees are not fat enough.   
  
I write, of course, about the $8.3 billion federal loan guarantee announced by President Obama this week for Southern Company to build two new nuclear power plants. The money will be used to guarantee the loans being made by the federal government (via the Federal Financing Bank) to partially cover the cost of Southern’s projected $14 billion nuclear construction project at their Vogtle plant near Waynesboro, Georgia. The loan guarantees were authorized by Congress in the 2005 Energy Policy Act and, we are told, are the first installment on a total package of $54 billion that the President would like to hand out to facilitate the construction of 7-10 new nuclear power plants (Congress, however, has only authorized $18.5 billion to this point).   
  
The claim being made by some – that the loan guarantees are necessary to jump-start investor interest in new nuclear power plant construction – is not quite correct. Even _these_ lavish loan guarantees aren’t enough to do _that_. In a letter to the U.S. Department of Energy dated July 2, 2007, six of Wall Street’s s then-largest investment banks – Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley – informed the administration that, contrary to the government’s expectations, anything short of a 100 percent unconditional guarantee would be insufficient to induce private lending.   
  
Why is it risky to build nuclear power plants? Because new nuclear projects tie up more capital for longer periods of time than its main competitor, natural-gas fired generation. Nuclear power makes economic sense only if natural gas prices are very high. Then, over time, the high initial costs of nuclear power would be offset by nuclear power’s lower fuel costs. Moreover, as noted by Moody’s in an analysis published in July of last year, there is uncertainty associated with construction costs, regulatory oversight, technological developments that might reduce the cost of rival facilities, and the ability of utilities to recover costs and make a profit over the lifetime of the plant – a risk tied up in the economic prospects of the region being served by the plant. And those risks have been increasing, not decreasing, as time has gone on.   




In short, even during the go-go days prior to the September 2008 crash – a time when Wall Street was allegedly throwing around money left and right to all sorts of dubious borrowers – the banks that stand accused of recklessly endangering their shareholders on other fronts were telling utility companies that they would not loan them anything for new nuclear power plant construction unless the feds unconditionally guaranteed every last penny of those loans. That’s how risky market actors think it is to build nuclear power plants.   
  
And it’s not as if the federal government disagrees completely. The Congressional Budget Office pegs the chance of default (program-wide) at 50 percent or better and the Government Accountability Office likewise thinks that default risks are quite high. Energy Secretary Stephen Chu says that he thinks the chance of default is much lower. We can only speculate about who’s right given that no one has tried to build a nuclear power plant in the United States for over 30 years.   
  
Regardless of what the risk actually is, the loan guarantees do not reduce that risk. They simply transfer the risk from the bank to taxpayer. In this particular case, however, the loan guarantee transfers risk from one arm of the state to the other, so it doesn’t really count. But if such loan guarantees _ever_ were to induce actual private lending for plant construction, that’s how it would work.   
  
Plenty of arguments have been offered to justify these loan guarantees. Most of them are flimsy on their face.   
  
For instance, we’re often told that we “need” new power plants. But with electricity demand declining over the past couple of years, it is unclear when that need might arise.   
  
Regardless, when the market “needs” more electricity, that need will be manifested in price signals that will carry with them profit opportunities. Profit-hungry investors will be willing and able to meet that need without the help of government. Of course, if market conditions don’t radically change, those needs will be met with gas-fired power plants, but hey, if that bothers you, take it up with someone else.   
  
Others argue that we need the jobs that will be produced by new nuclear power plants. Well, building big new reactors will certainly employ a lot of (largely unionized) construction workers. But that’s one reason why building a nuclear power plant is not very economic compared to building gas-fired generators. If creating jobs is the idea whether the project makes any economic sense or not, then let’s just ban food imports and farm equipment and put everyone to work with hand plows and scythes.   
  
Two somewhat more serious arguments have been offered to justify these loan guarantees. Neither of them stands up to much scrutiny either.   
  
The first argument – the argument most often heard from the nuclear power industry and some segments of the political Left – is that we need nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, the best (that is, most efficient) way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to internalize the cost of greenhouse gas emissions in the retail price of electricity and then allow market actors to adjust their production and consumption decisions accordingly. That price internalization exercise, however (whether directly through a carbon tax or indirectly through a cap-and-trade program), does not appear to be in the cards in the foreseeable future. Hence, the loan guarantees are advanced as a “second-best” solution, one that will get us the technology and economic efficiency that would be delivered by a properly crafted carbon tax or cap-and-trade program without the retail price increases associated with either.   
  
One of several problems with this argument is that it would take one hell of a carbon tax – or one hell of an onerous cap-and-trade program – to get anyone interested in building nuclear power plants. If natural gas prices remained roughly where they are at present (that is, if they were to remain at historical norms) then it would take a $90 per ton carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program that delivered carbon emission credits at $90 per ton on the open market to induce investment in nuclear power plants. Few economists who study climate policy believe that a carbon tax of that size is defensible given what we know about climate change.   
  
And that’s if construction costs are as low as advertised. Were they to double (as they did from 2003 to 2009) – either because of endogenous increases in the cost of capital, labor, or construction-related resources or because of cost overruns – then it would take at least a $150 per ton carbon tax (or a cap-and-trade program that delivered $150 carbon credits to the market) to induce investment.   
  
You might ask yourself what the historical relationship is between final (inflation-adjusted) nuclear power plant construction costs in the United States and construction costs as projected at the onset of the project. Happily, the CBO has done your homework for you. They found that final construction costs averaged 207 percent of projected costs. Hence, a doubling of construction costs is probably more likely than not once a project is underway … if past is prologue.   
  
The upshot is that there are many more efficient ways to respond to greenhouse gas emission constraints than to go on a nuclear power bender. This observation is heresy on the Right, but almost every credible analysis of the matter backs up that observation.   
  
The second argument one hears to justify federal loan guarantees is that they are necessary to counter-balance the excessive regulatory costs associated with new plant construction. Now, put aside the fact that the Nuclear Energy Institute – the trade association of the nuclear power industry – has often expressed near-total satisfaction with the current federal regulatory regime. If the regulatory regime is truly “bad” and, accordingly, is imposing steep and unnecessary costs on the industry, then the correct remedy is to improve said regulatory regime, not to subsidize the industry.   
  
The counter-complaint that positive regulatory reforms are impossible is difficult to swallow. After all, if there is sufficient political will to bestow tens of billions of dollars worth of tax money on this industry, then surely there is enough political will to reform the bad and unnecessarily costly regulations allegedly bedeviling the object of those very same legislative affections.   
  
I will confess to being skeptical about the argument that high construction costs are largely the fault of regulators. Building a light water breeder reactor is a technologically challenging and costly undertaking whether regulators are on the scene or not. Moreover, it is not obvious to me that the regulations that _are_ in place are _a priori_ objectionable from a libertarian perspective.   
  
One rarely, if ever, hears of particulars in this bill of complaint offered about nuclear regulation. But if a persuasive bill of complaints is ever presented, then the appropriate response is regulatory reform and then to leave the decision to build or not to build to markets.   
  
In the course of announcing these loan guarantees, President Obama said this week that “The fact is, changing the ways we produce and use energy requires us to think anew. It requires us to act anew.” Well, there’s nothing new about throwing subsidies at nuclear power. Economist Douglas Koplow calculates that federal nuclear subsidies have totaled $178 billion from 1947-1999. The promise of a nuclear economy with rates too cheap to meter has been made for over half a century. What would be new would be a policy of “just saying no” to industries with their hands out in Washington.

"It may be the fastest animal on earth, but the cheetah is struggling to outrun the threats to its extinction. With only 50 to 70 animals estimated to remain in Iran, the Asiatic cheetah is on the verge of extinction in the wild. While the more familiar African cheetah is more numerous, with around 12,000 individuals across the whole continent, it’s also at risk. So long as humans and wildlife compete for the use of the same land and resources, there will always be a struggle. This comes down to rights, and which species have more. Animals, including humans, are resource-driven, so removing food sources and fragmenting habitats will have the most serious impact on a species. But when humans go beyond this by actively removing “problem animals”, perhaps due to a perceived threat to crops or livestock, this puts an even greater pressure on their survival. However, there are means to try to boost cheetah numbers in the wild. Fenced, predator-proof refuge areas, such as private reserves like Cheetah Plains Private Game Reserve and Timbavati Nature Reserve, can be appropriately stocked and managed to ensure cheetah survival. Populations can also be relocated to regions where cheetahs historically ranged but where the cause of their extermination has been addressed. This was demonstrated by the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia and the Endangered Wildlife Trust in South Africa.  Alternatively, cheetahs can be bred in captivity, trained, and released into controlled wild areas. Where species or sub-species are critically endangered, the release of captive-bred animals into the wild can be used as way of supplementing existing populations or forming new founder populations. In South Africa, the most promising strategy has been when cheetahs, prior to release, have been “trained to be wild”. This includes changing their diet to the wild game they will encounter on release so they become accustomed to tearing skin and even chewing around bones. And they must develop the strength to be able to bring down prey. It’s also important that these cheetahs become accustomed to starvation periods when prey is scarce or other conditions hinder a successful hunt. These are simple things that a wild cheetah would learn through nurture, but captive breeding does not afford the luxury of learning from mother. Removing any conditioning or familiarity to human presence that can develop during captivity is also important as this could pose a threat to the cheetahs – and to people. If cheetahs gravitate to human settlements which carry familiar associations with food they are likely to be harmed, and in a volatile situation a cheetah is perfectly capable of causing harm with its teeth and claws. Once the animal has been released, there are even more decisions to be made about how to monitor and manage the programme. There is debate as to what is deemed a successful re-introduction – for example, if and when breeding can take place, and how independent of human interference the animals really are. Such re-introductions have been tried but have not always been successful, mainly because of human influences like poisoning, hunting, and road accidents. Other deaths have been due to natural problems of starvation, disease, or often due to insufficient conditioning of the animal prior to release. The forerunner of these style of re-introduction projects is the Ann Van Dyke Cheetah Centre (formerly the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre), which produced 785 cubs between 1975-2005. As part of a re-introduction project, the centre released six captive bred cheetahs into the wild between 2007-2010 – two single females and two pairs of male coalitions (as social animals, cheetah males often form a group known as a coalition). After extensive training, only one female and two males survived and recovered their wild habits. Since then, there have been no more attempts to re-introduce captive bred cheetah into the wild in South Africa. Until human populations see evident economic or cultural value in wildlife then protecting endangered species such as the cheetah will continue to be a struggle. And until these values can be assured then any efforts to increase wild cheetah populations will be futile. It’s essential – particularly when dealing with endangered species and predators – that the issues that drove them to become endangered in the first place are tackled. Unfortunately this usually takes time and effort, and so it’s important to continue working on programmes of captive-born reintroductions. While these have not always been successful, the ground has been laid for future work, and re-introduction remains an important means to win time in the fight against species extinction. "
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

The Thai people have voted. The crony populists decisively defeated the establishment thugs. It probably was the best outcome among imperfect choices.



Thailand has been in various stages of political crisis for years. The only good news is that while Thailand is Southeast Asia’s second‐​largest economy, even the worst political chaos there affects no vital American interest. Long‐​term stability will come only if the country’s ruling elite is willing to cede power to the disaffected and heretofore neglected rural majority.



The Thai monarchy was made famous by _The King and I_ and lost its absolute power seventy‐​nine years ago. In recent years, parliamentary democracy and powerful army have uneasily coexisted: over the years there have been eleven coups, seven attempted coups, twenty‐​three military governments, and nine military‐​dominated regimes. Helping provide political stability was King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a widely revered figure able to call even military rulers to account.





It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new.



This system is breaking down, however. The king is eighty‐​three and has been hospitalized since late 2009. The crown prince enjoys little of the respect accorded his father and some Thai citizens have proposed bypassing him for his sister or even jumping to one of his young sons.



Moreover, a decade ago a frustrated rural majority rallied behind billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra to overthrow the country’s cozy political establishment. Thaksin promised to share the wealth, winning elections — and, it was charged, growing wealthier himself — in return. He became prime minister in 2001, only to be ousted in a coup in 2006.



Unfortunately, King Bhumibol has been increasingly unable to intervene even if he was inclined to act. Worse, the courtiers surrounding him and the queen allied themselves with the military and other elites. The judiciary also was firmly in establishment hands, an important factor where political outcomes often are determined by judges.



With Thaksin living in Dubai to avoid prison, the military rewrote the constitution to restrict the power of elected officials — not to protect the people, like the original U.S. Constitution, but to safeguard the ruling coalition of royalists, businessmen, military officers, and bureaucrats. They relied on the misnamed Democrat Party as their political vehicle. However, Thaksin’s successor party won a plurality of seats in the 2007 vote and formed a coalition government.



The courts then disqualified a succession of pro‐​Thaksin parliamentarians, parties, and prime ministers on dubious charges — one of the latter, for instance, was ousted for being paid to host a televised cooking show. In contrast, the DP, which had not won even a plurality of the vote since 1992, received much kindlier treatment when charged with legal violations.



So‐​called “Yellow Shirt” demonstrators took over the prime minister’s office and international airport, demanding the government’s ouster and constitutional changes to disenfranchise the rural majority, and the army refused to restore order. Thailand’s strict lese‐​majeste laws were largely deployed against Thaksin supporters — there were 164 cases in 2009 alone — as establishment forces charged him with planning to downgrade the monarchy. (Even foreigners, including an American blogger and an Australian novelist living in Thailand, have ended up behind bars for mild or indirect criticism of things royal.) Behind the scenes the court and army pressured coalition partners to switch sides, finally turning the government over to the Democrat Party.



As largely urban dwellers, the Yellow Shirts had an obvious advantage in organizing protests. But in 2009 and 2010 Thaksin loyalists, known as Red Shirts, managed to fill Bangkok, first to disrupt an ASEAN summit and later to shut down much of the financial district. The military conveniently decided that this time public demonstrations threatened Thailand’s security and bloodily evicted the protestors. At least 91 people died and more than 1800 were wounded; opposition leaders were prosecuted and imprisoned.



Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva spoke of reconciliation while continuing to demonize the Red Shirts. Thaksin turned to his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, to carry his banner for the Puea Thai Party in the July 3 election. She promised to increase the minimum wage, hike subsidies for the elderly, expand price supports, initiate tax relief and provide a host of other benefits. The normally more fiscally responsible DP responded accordingly, but populism lite offered little electoral appeal. Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan‐​ocha staged a televised attack on the Puea Thai Party, but could not staunch the anger of Red Shirt activists.



The result was a decisive victory for 44‐​year‐​old Yingluck. Her party took 265 seats in a 500‐​member parliament, compared to just 159 for the DP. A party formed by the general who staged the 2006 coup won two seats.



Yingluck immediately moved to form a coalition with four smaller parties, giving her government nearly 299 seats. Strengthening her coalition makes it harder for opponents to again use the judiciary to win back political control. The electoral commission said it was investigating election violations which could lead to the disqualification of candidates — and no one expects an objective judgment.



The military promised to respect the election result. Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said: “We are not going to intervene.” But leading officers disclaimed any interest in staging a coup before the last one. Activists opposed to Puea Thai’s victory have promised protests and in a majority of those polled by the Bangkok Post said they expect political violence in the future.



The putative prime minister faces an extraordinary challenge. The members of the frustrated and long‐​marginalized majority who voted for her expect a better future, even though her policies could wreck the government budget, business climate and national economy. Her brother hopes for an amnesty which would allow him to return home, a step which would enrage his opponents.



Dealing with the traditional ruling institutions accustomed to occupying the commanding heights of power likely will be even harder for Yingluck. Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Singapore’s Institute of South East Asian Studies observed: “I think one of her biggest challenges is how to build a working relationship with the elite, particularly the military.” Indeed, Christophe Archambault, who covered Thailand for 17 years for Reuters, warned that her tenure could be short: “The establishment is likely to resort again to Yellow Shirt mob violence, a judicial intervention, or even another coup to unseat her. That will tear Thailand further apart.”



There is much scuttlebutt about the potential of striking a deal or even having struck a deal before the election to protect the military from prosecution for the 2006 coup and last year’s crackdown on the Red Shirts in return for accepting a Yingluck government. One can imagine the appeal to the Thaksin forces of such an arrangement.



But the incoming prime minister’s ultimate objective should be to strip establishment institutions of their ability to effectively invalidate elections when they don’t like the results. One young voter declared: “It’s been a so‐​called democracy, not a real democracy. This time I’d like the majority to decide the winner. I really want democracy to decide the outcome.”



Of course, confronting thuggish elites requires a firm government hand, strong political base, and steely personal nerves. A similar process took years in Turkey, in which the so‐​called Deep State dominated by the military and other elites used the courts and laws protecting the image of Turkey founder Kemal Attaturk to maintain their influence irrespective of election results. A Thai government that demonstrates economic success would be far better positioned to undertake far‐​reaching political reforms.



There’s not much Washington, which urged the outgoing government to respect the election result, or anyone else can do other than counsel caution, patience, reconciliation and compromise. Thitinan Pongsudhirak of the Institute of Security and International Studies observed: “We must take the long view. This is not a two‐​year or a three‐​year exercise. We are talking about two or three decades of political maturation to come. It will be many years before we can reconcile the old order and the new order.”



It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new. If not, the Thai people will need all the good wishes they can get to manage the future.

Ugly reality has dashed the high hopes of the “Arab Spring.” Although the dream of democratic reform lives on, only Tunisia appears on course. In Egypt, the fall of Hosni Mubarak has encouraged religious intolerance and persecution, especially against the Coptic Christian community.



Once a great civilization, Egypt long ago turned into an impoverished backwater. Only a large population and strategic location today deliver geopolitical importance. Hosni Mubarak ruled for three decades, but under him the Egyptian people enjoyed neither prosperity nor liberty. In fact, Mubarak was exhibit A for America’s foreign policy conundrum: stability or democracy? He held the Muslim Brotherhood in check, maintained a cold peace with Israel, and kept the Suez Canal open. For that he was richly rewarded with tens of billions in “foreign aid,” which he used to build an authoritarian kleptocracy — one that treated the needs of most Egyptians as an afterthought. Washington occasionally pushed for reform, but never too hard, lest stability be sacrificed.



Mubarak counted among his victims the Coptic Christians, who make up around ten percent of the population. They predate Islam, but today are a disadvantaged and increasingly threatened minority. Rather like Saddam Hussein and the Assad family, Mubarak seemingly cared little for religion. However, he left more room for Islamic extremists to act and compete for political support by victimizing religious minorities.



While the “government does not actively persecute or repress Christians, a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity,” noted Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty in Egypt “poor.” State added that Christians and Baha’is faced “personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship.”



Moreover, the regime “sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed” those “whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.” Government‐​controlled media and government‐​funded mosques encourage violence. The authorities do little to stop the kidnapping of young Coptic girls, who then are forced to marry Muslims.



Converts are at particular risk. Despite some recent progress, the government traditionally refused to provide new identity documents to converts as well as Baha’is. Worse, noted William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law, “Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment — including imprisonment and sadistic torture.”



Equally disturbing, noted the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, “violence targeting Coptic Orthodox Christians remained high.” But the Mubarak government rarely punished the attackers. Indeed, International Christian Concern noted that it was common for the government to arrest “Coptic victims alongside the perpetrators of the violence.”



Even when the Copts did not end up behind bars, they did not receive justice. State explained that the Mubarak government sponsored “informal reconciliation sessions” which “generally prevented the criminal prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against Copts, precluded their recourse to the judicial system for restitution, and contributed to a climate of impunity that encouraged further assaults.”



No surprise, failing to exact a penalty for murder and mayhem has led to more murder and mayhem — or what the Hudson Institute’s Nina Shea called “pogroms and acts of terror.” The failure to punish the perpetrators, complained the Commission, “continued to foster a climate of impunity, making further violence likely.” Even more emphatic was Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who told a recent congressional hearing that “the Egyptian regime is fully responsible for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine.”



Unfortunately, those who hoped the Egyptian revolution would better protect Christians and other religious minorities have been disappointed. To the contrary, violent attacks on Copts have been increasing.



As of last month 24 Christians had been killed, more than 200 had been injured, and three churches had been destroyed. Muslim mobs have beset Coptic churches, businesses, and homes. Well‐​armed thugs also attacked Christians who were protesting against the forgoing attacks.



No surprise, then, that few perpetrators have been arrested, let alone imprisoned. Noted Paul Marshall of the Hudson Institute: “as under Mubarak, the authorities’ refusal to punish attacks on Christians has led to more attacks.” The army even assaulted two Coptic monasteries, supposedly to enforce discriminatory zoning laws (which prohibited walls erected for protection from attacks).



Overall, the transition regime’s record is dismal. Noted the Commission: “Since February 11, military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators. Implementation of previous court rulings — related to granting official identity documents to Baha’is and changing religious affiliation on identity documents for Christian converts — continues to lag. In addition, the government has not responded adequately to combat widespread and virulent anti‐​Semitism in the government‐​controlled media.”



Islamic extremists are responsible for what increasingly looks to be a campaign of intimidation. The World Evangelical Alliance’s Religious Liberty Commission explained that the attacks were “mostly incited by conservative Salafi Muslims,” who are using violence to mobilize Islamist support. Salafis also led opposition to the choice of a Christian to be governor of the Qena Governorate, leading to a suspension of the appointment, even though his predecessor was a Christian. Traditionally, the Salafis had remained aloof from politics, but no longer. Alas, they make the Muslim Brotherhood appear moderate.



Nina Shea fears “what we’re seeing in Egypt today — namely, a reinvigorated effort by some of the country’s more radical Islamists to establish Egypt’s identity as a thoroughly Islamicized and Arabicized state.” The Copts “are the most visible bloc standing in the way of impatient jihadists and violent Salafis,” who therefore are accelerating their attacks.



The future looks increasingly bleak. Although there has been some pushback — Muslims rallied to help rebuild one of the destroyed churches — the vast majority of Egyptians express intolerance towards minority faiths. And Copts, as well as other Christians, are feeling the pressure.



The _Wall Street Journal_ entitled one article: “As Islamists Flex Muscle, Egypt’s Christians Despair.” It quoted Ayman Anwar Mitri, who was attacked by Islamists who cut off an ear and burned his apartment: “they kept saying: ‘We won’t leave any Christians in this country’.” No one was punished for the assault. One Salafi leader warned ominously: “Only those Christians who did something wrong should be fearful.” Mitri said simply: “Here, there is a war against the Copts.”



Shea worries about “a mass exodus” of Copts from Egypt if existing trends continue. In fact, the Egyptian media has reported an upsurge in Copts seeking to emigrate. Coptic human rights lawyer Naguib Gabriel said: “They are insisting on leaving Egypt because the risks of staying here are too great.” Iraq offers an ugly precedent, with the practical destruction of the large historic Christian community, which also precedes Islam. Syria has become the refuge for many Iraqi exiles, who fear that the overthrow of Bashar Assad could unleash similar violence there. The status of Christians and other religious minorities is growing ever more precarious throughout the Arab and broader Islamic world.



For the first time the USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern, which, if adopted by State, could lead to a variety of penalties. Still, Washington’s influence inevitably is limited. The Obama administration had no idea how to respond to Egypt’s upheaval, haphazardly offering support for Mubarak before exhibiting enthusiasm for the revolution — and its ever‐​changing stance had no effect on events on the street in any case.



Nevertheless, religious liberty should be part of the U.S. government’s official dialogue with existing regimes and revolutionary forces alike. Religious freedom is a bedrock form of human rights. This basic freedom of conscience acts as the proverbial canary in the mine. If peoples and governments are not willing to respect religious minorities, they are unlikely to tolerate political opponents. Religious extremism also acts as an efficient incubator for violence, including terrorism, as is increasingly evident in Pakistan. “There is no political vision to deal with these types of sectarian clashes,” admitted Emad Gad of the Cairo‐​based Al‐​Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.



While Washington cannot impose tolerance on the new Egypt, American officials can point to the danger posed by virulent Islamists to that nation’s future. If the radicals grow in influence, they are likely to sweep away more than the vulnerable Coptic population. They might take down the new political system, with dangerous consequences for Egypt and beyond. As Georgetown’s Thomas Farr testified before Congress last month: “There will be no real freedom in Egypt — period — and there will be no real stability in Egypt — period — unless there is full religious freedom in Egypt, not only for its Coptic minority but also for moderate and reformist Muslim voices.”



The Arab Spring risks turning into the Islamist Winter. The willingness to safeguard religious liberty has become a proxy for measuring the impact of the ongoing revolution. As go the Copts may ultimately go the rest of the Middle East.

"Do Not Resuscitate. This tag should be attached to the oil, airline and car industries. Governments should provide financial support to company workers while refashioning the economy to provide new jobs in different sectors. They should prop up only those sectors that will help secure the survival of humanity and the rest of the living world. They should either buy up the dirty industries and turn them towards clean technologies, or do what they often call for but never really want: let the market decide. In other words, allow these companies to fail. This is our second great chance to do things differently. It could be our last. The first, in 2008, was spectacularly squandered. Vast amounts of public money were spent reassembling the filthy old economy, while ensuring that wealth remained in the hands of the rich. Today, many governments appear determined to repeat that catastrophic mistake. The “free market” has always been a product of government policy. If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel – hundreds of millions of unsaleable barrels, to be more precise – just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector’s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today. The Bank of England has decided to buy debt from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has given easyJet a £600m loan even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away £171m in dividends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes $25bn (£20.1bn) for airlines. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and sweeping away pollution laws, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to rescue their airlines and car manufacturers. Don’t believe them when they tell you they do this on our behalf. A recent survey by Ipsos of 14 countries suggests that, on average, 65% of people want climate change to be prioritised in the economic recovery. Everywhere, electorates must struggle to persuade governments to act in the interests of the people, rather than the corporations and billionaires who fund and lobby them. The perennial democratic challenge is to break the bonds between politicians and the economic sectors they should be regulating, or, in this case, closing down. Even when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent letter to the government from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they “do more to tackle the climate crisis” could have been written in 1990. Air travel is inherently polluting. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts. The current crisis gives us a glimpse of how much we need to do to pull out of our disastrous trajectory. Despite the vast changes we have made in our lives, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to reduce by only about 5.5% this year. A UN report shows that to stand a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5C or more of global heating, we need to cut emissions by 7.6% per year for the next decade. In other words, the lockdown exposes the limits of individual action. Travelling less helps, but not enough. To make the necessary cuts we need structural change. This means an entirely new industrial policy, created and guided by government. Governments like the UK’s should drop their road-building plans. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground. During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and – when physical distancing is less necessary – public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand – through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver. In other words, let’s have what many people were calling for long before this disaster hit: a green new deal. But please let’s stop describing it as a stimulus package. We have stimulated consumption too much over the past century, which is why we face environmental disaster. Let us call it a survival package, whose purpose is to provide incomes, distribute wealth and avoid catastrophe, without stoking perpetual economic growth. Bail out the people, not the corporations. Bail out the living world, not its destroyers. Let’s not waste our second chance.  George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist This article has been changed to reflect the most up-to-date figures on the US airline bailout."

It is a rhetorical question, because you all know the answer. Either the baby is wheeled out, or there is a puff piece on Jacinda Ardern. I waited for a baby pic on Friday, but this week has been so bad for the government, and for Jacinda in particular, that a baby photo was never going to cut it. Even Jacinda getting herself covered in baby poo was never going to cut it. This time, we need the big guns. This time, we need to be reminded how she might – please note MIGHT – be in line for a Nobel Peace Prize. 



Prime minister Jacinda Ardern, 39, is an unusual figure by American standards. Elected with little leadership experience two years ago, she is now “the most obvious candidate for a Nobel Prize,” says Kurt Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. 



She is likely to get the Nobel Peace Prize for hugging people? Is that all it takes nowadays? So, what this means is that Nobel Peace Prizes are given away in cornflakes packets. Before she is awarded anything, someone should consult the victims of the various Labour Party sex scandals, to see how they feel about it. 



Because, a year ago, at the UN General Assembly, Jacinda talked about how _#metoo_ should become _#wetoo_. How women should not have to put up with sexual assault. It was a powerful speech, but as we all know now, she didn’t mean a word of it. The victims of sexual abuse within the Labour party have been hung out to dry. Ignored, disbelieved, and told not to go to the police, they were assured that the Party would deal with the allegations, only for the Party to brush them under the carpet and find no case to answer. 



Are you seriously telling me that the leader of this Party might be in line for a Nobel Peace Prize? 



Seriously?



Well, Lally Weymouth of the _Washington Post_ thinks so. 



On the eve of her trip to New York for the first UN General Assembly meeting since the tragedy catapulted her to global renown, New Zealand’s Ardern chatted in her office with _The Washington Post’s_ Lally Weymouth about gun control, Chinese interference and whether she’d have a second child while in office. 



Have you ever seen so much media interference as happens around Jacinda Ardern? Why is it that, two years after her becoming prime minister, we are still reading articles about her ‘rise to power’ and the fact that she has had a baby? Did this happen with John Key? No, it didn’t because John Key, whose rise to power was far more meteoric than Jacinda’s, had one thing that she has never had. He had substance. 



When there is nothing positive that you can say about Jacinda’s time as prime minister, then you have no choice. You have to keep regurgitating the supposedly good stuff… that she won an election after being the Labour leader for only seven weeks (they did not win the election, if you remember, but if you say it often enough, it will become truth. Orwell called it “Newspeak”), and that she has had a baby. That is all there is. Really.



Q: You also created a gun buyback programme.



A: Yes, and it’s now brought in more than 17,000 semiautomatic and assault rifles. Over 70,000 banned parts have been returned as well. Initially, we said we were going to deal with the guns that we thought just weren’t necessary. That was done within 12 days. People now bring back their guns and acknowledge that it’s all about making New Zealand safer.



Yes, I feel really safe, knowing that responsible, licensed gun holders have given up their semi-automatic weapons while the gangs still hold whatever weapons they want. 



Q: Do you worry about China coming to dominate the Pacific Island states?



A: What dominates my concern with the Pacific Islands is climate change. That has been identified by the Pacific Islands themselves as their biggest regional security threat. Of course there is a debate about the presence of others in the region.



Yeah, don’t worry about Chinese influence in the Pacific, Jacinda. Climate change is the issue – where islands are disappearing because of abusing their own water systems and causing flooding and extreme water issues – is it? 



Q: Before the 2017 election, you weren’t the head of the Labour Party. Andrew Little, the leader, resigned shortly before the election and said you should take over.



A: Actually, I just told him no. I said he should stay, but he quit. I was already the deputy, and so I accepted the nomination to be party leader.



  
Yet here we are.



Jacinda is off to the UN next week, via Japan… no doubt to flirt with the All Blacks and have a few more photoshoots. There is no doubt, though, that her brand is tainted. I am not sure where exactly this will end, but her naivety and lack of substance is out there for all to see.



 _#metoo_ should be _#wetoo_? Ask the Labour Party sexual assault victims how exactly they feel about that.

"The shocking news that Satao, the much-loved African Elephant who lived in Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park, has been killed and butchered for his tusks highlights once again the terrible and unsustainable toll of poaching elephants for their ivory.  Increasingly authorities are using forensic methods to track and trace the origins of seized ivory, providing the means to tackle enforcement problems in the country where the animal was killed, rather than just the point where the attempt was made to smuggle it out of the continent. Satao’s death is just one among the many thousands of elephants killed each year. The Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme, part of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) set up as part of the worldwide ban in 1989, reported that 22,000 African elephants were illegally killed by poachers in 2012, based on data from 27 countries across Africa. The figures for 2013 reported this month show a toll of over 20,000 African elephants, the vast majority of seizures by customs or border officials being made in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. The CITES report reveals that while the numbers of elephants poached appears to have stabilised, among large seizures of more than 500kg the number of tusks found in each seizure is rising. This suggests two things: that there are fewer elephants to poach, and that the trade is well-organised and not the work of individual poachers or small groups. This level of slaughter far exceeds the reproductive potential of the remaining elephants and will, by any account, lead to the extinction of the African elephant in many parts of the continent. The international community is only now responding to this crisis for the African elephant with action. Knowing which populations the poachers are targeting can play an important part. Work pioneered by Professor Sam Wasser at the University of Washington uses DNA profiling from seized ivory to trace it back to the geographical location within Africa from which the ivory was taken once roamed.  There are two species of elephant in Africa, the savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). Within these two species are many sub-populations, such as extended family groups, where there is a greater sharing of DNA types due to inheritance from common ancestors. So some DNA types become much more common than others in defined geographical ranges, which means that using similar DNA profiling techniques to those used in human forensic science, the DNA from ivory provides a map leading back to the geographic area where those sub-populations with similar DNA profiles are found. Under CITES there is a total ban on the trade in elephant ivory, although not from all other species that have ivory, nor from tusks removed from mammoths – being extinct, they cannot be provided any legal protection. The cost of mammoth ivory is approximately US$350 per kilogramme – significantly cheaper than elephant ivory – but often looks very similar. Again, DNA typing can distinguish between African and Asian elephants and mammoths. This aspect of wildlife forensic science is supported by the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, and has already proved highly successful in tracking seizures and locating their source. For example, when a 6.5 tonne shipment was seized in Singapore, DNA testing revealed it had come from elephant populations in Zambia. With that knowledge, pressure applied saw Zambia’s director of wildlife replaced and its courts start to impose harsher sentences for ivory smugglers in order to tackle the problem at source. Unfortunately such tests do not come cheap and are rarely conducted for free. The illegal trade in wildlife is highly profitable and well-organised. If nations wish to save the African elephant, then action to provide – and fund – the tools necessary is required. A CITES meeting last year agreed that all authorities making seizures over 500kg would submit samples for DNA analysis to boost the details mapping seizures to populations. The reason there is a trade at all is to provide ivory for markets in China and the Far East. Based on intelligence from seized shipments, ivory is exported from Africa to countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam where the ivory is processed before being sold on. 
It’s difficult to devise a cost per kilogramme of ivory (a tusker such as Satao would carry around 45kg of ivory) but the latest estimates are that a carved ornament of 10kg will sell ultimately for US$60,000. With booming economies in many countries of Southeast Asia, and China in particular, the amount of disposable income has rapidly increased alongside a desire for ivory as a status symbol. And as ivory becomes rare due to the alarming decrease in elephant numbers, the concurrent increase in value will put ever more pressure on the dwindling elephant populations."
"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

You gotta hand it to startup, Sendle – they’re really ahead of the curve when it comes to corporate virtue-signalling. Most corporates wait until they’ve actually established a reputation before trashing it by getting woke and going broke. Not the bright young things at Sendle: they’re determined to hoist themselves on their own petard, right out of the gate.



Postal upstart Sendle is throwing down the gauntlet to its Goliath rival Australia Post, challenging the government-run giant to immediately go carbon neural in the midst of an “imminent climate emergency”…



Australia Post this month said it would move to offset emissions for parcel products sent through its Post Office and MyPost Business channels…In response, Sendle said it would offset the carbon emissions from all of Australia Post’s domestic parcels for one day – a volume estimated to be 1 million parcels – to coincide with the youth climate strike.



Well, of course, they are.



Naturally, too, no self-respecting millennial’s ignorant virtue-signalling is complete without a fawning reference to Swedish sour-faced know-nothing brat, Greta Thunberg.



“Greta Thunberg said it well, that we need to treat this like an emergency now,” he said.



Greta Thunberg also says she can see carbon dioxide. Greta Thunberg is an ignorant child.



But, as always, when they babble about “carbon neutral”, what these hypocrites really mean is that they’re going to be pumping out just as much of that evil, plant-feeding carbon dioxide as ever, they’ll just plough their investors’ money into dodgy green scams.



Sendle’s offsetting process involved the purchasing of carbon credits, and investing in environmental projects around the world designed to reduce future carbon emissions.



  
Will that include dispossessing poor African farmers to plant “biofuel” plantations? Or shipping American trees to burn in Germany as “biomass”?



If the slew of negative commentary on media articles about this latest display of corporate wokeness is anything to go by, this start-up may have spiked their guns spectacularly.

"Does the sky protect the Earth and if yes, then how? – Saskia, aged eight, Estonia. Thanks for the question, Saskia. The “sky” actually means everything above the Earth’s surface, including space. That’s why so many stars – like our own sun, but much further away – light up the night sky.  But in between our planet’s surface and outer space, there’s the atmosphere. The atmosphere is made up of gases, which do most of the hard work protecting the Earth as it goes around the sun.   Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. All questions are welcome: you or an adult can send them to curiouskids@theconversation.com – along with your name, age and place where you live. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our best. Gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour trap some of the heat from the sun’s rays, which would otherwise go back out into space.   This keeps the Earth at a comfortable temperature, and prevents it getting too cold – like a giant greenhouse.  The Earth has always had these “greenhouse gases” in its atmosphere, but humans keep adding more and more, so the planet is warming up quicker than it would naturally. This has a big impact on life all over Earth, from the seas to the mountains.

      Curious Kids: how is global warming heating up the Earth?


 As well as greenhouse gases, the atmosphere also contains oxygen as a gas, which animal life needs to survive. Plants play a big role here, because they do photosynthesis – a natural process that helps them make food. During this process, they take in carbon dioxide from the air and let oxygen back out.  From ten to 50 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, you’ll find lots of a gas called “ozone”. Scientists call this the “ozone layer”, and it’s the Earth’s natural sunscreen.  The sun’s rays feel nice and warm, and in small doses they’re very good for us. But they also contain harmful ultraviolet (or UV) radiation, which is what gives you sunburn.  UV radiation can damage your skin, and even cause skin cancer – that’s why it’s so important to wear sunscreen when you’re outdoors.  The ozone layer protects us by absorbing a lot of the UV radiation from the sun’s rays, before they even reach Earth’s surface. But in the past, humans damaged the ozone layer by releasing chemicals which ate up some of this ozone, causing an “ozone hole”. Countries around the world agreed to stop releasing these chemicals about 40 years ago, and the hole in the ozone layer is now starting to close – though it probably won’t heal fully until 2050.  The atmosphere is also where weather happens – clouds, rain, lightning and storms all form in the atmosphere.  Without the atmosphere, rain would not reach many parts of the land, where plants and animals need it to survive, and farmers need it to grow food.  The Earth’s atmosphere also shields us from space rocks called meteoroids. Without the atmosphere, meteoroids would crash into the ground every day – and you can imagine how dangerous that would be.  But when a meteoroid starts falling towards Earth from outer space, it travels very quickly through the gases in the atmosphere, and this causes it to get very, very hot and shine brightly.  Most meteoroids burn up before they reach the surface. Those that don’t eventually hit the ground: these are called “meteorites” and they can tell us a lot about what’s in outer space.

In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, ignited. Historically, this fire was unremarkable — rivers elsewhere in the United States had caught fire throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Cuyahoga had blazed at least 13 times since 1868. But the 1969 event attracted enormous attention and outrage, and the fire is often listed as one reason behind the passage of U.S. environmental laws in the early 1970s.



The Cuyahoga has not burned since 1969 and is now home to 40 species of fish. But water pollution issues are not just a part of history. Today, more than half of U.S. rivers and lakes violate environmental standards, and 4–28 percent of Americans in a typical year receive drinking water from systems that violate health‐​based standards. Flint, Michigan, recently exposed 100,000 residents to dangerous levels of lead in drinking water. Contaminated drinking water leads an estimated 16 million Americans to suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses annually.



Polls also suggest that water pollution has been Americans’ top environmental concern for at least 30 years. Sixty percent of Americans today list drinking‐​water pollution and also river and lake pollution as great concerns. In every survey since 1989, the share concerned about these issues has substantially exceeded the share expressing concern about air pollution, climate change, or other environmental problems.



The federal government sought to address these concerns by creating the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972, and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974. The Clean Water Act regulates “surface waters” — rivers, lakes, and some ocean areas. Whether the Clean Water Act regulates groundwater, which includes subsurface aquifers, is legally disputed. The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates drinking water, which includes groundwater or surface water that is purified by a drinking‐​water treatment plant and then transported by pipe to households and businesses.



A half century later, these laws still manage U.S. surface and drinking water. Since 1970, the United States has spent approximately $4.8 trillion (in 2017 dollars) to clean up surface‐​water pollution and provide clean drinking water, or more than $400 annually for every American. In the average year, this accounts for 0.8 percent of the gross domestic product, making clean water arguably the most expensive environmental investment in U.S. history. By comparison, the average American spends $60 annually on bottled water.



We ask four main questions: What forces led to these laws? How do they regulate pollution? How effective and efficient have they been? Why has recent economic research focused relatively little on water pollution, and what can remedy this lack of research? We illustrate that water pollution provides an excellent setting to learn about externalities, cost‐​benefit analysis, local public goods, fiscal federalism, regulatory design, nonmarket valuation, and other classic economic issues. Indeed, water pollution is a textbook example of an externality — introductory texts have long used the example of a plant dumping waste into a river and causing people downstream to suffer to illustrate the concept of externalities.



We emphasize several main conclusions. Many measures of drinking‐ and surface‐​water pollution have fallen since the EPA’s founding, due at least in part to the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The progress, however, is incomplete. William Ruckelshaus, first head of the EPA, noted, “Even if all of our waters are not swimmable or fishable, at least they are not flammable.”



But while these large investments in drinking water do appear to create substantial health benefits, existing evidence suggests that estimated costs of most investments in cleaning up rivers, lakes, and oceans exceed their measured benefits. A summary of cost‐​benefit analyses of 240 regulations implemented by the federal government between 1992 and 2017 finds that out of five categories of regulations (surface water, drinking water, air pollution, greenhouse gases, and all other regulations, including nonenvironmental ones), surface‐​water regulations are the only category where total estimated costs exceed total estimated benefits. Estimated total benefits are only 80 percent of estimated total costs, and the mean regulation has benefits that are only 57 percent of its costs. Sixty‐​seven percent of surface‐​water regulations fail a cost‐​benefit test, compared to 20 percent of drinking‐​water regulations and 8 percent of air pollution regulations.



It is noted that many of these estimates have difficulty quantifying several important channels of benefits and may be understating true benefits. But even if costs are underestimated, there are several reasons regulation of surface‐​water quality could produce smaller net benefits than other types of environmental investments. For example, surface‐​water policy does not typically use market‐​based instruments, such as cap‐​and‐​trade markets or pollution taxes, which are generally cost effective. Beyond specific policy choices, surface waters may be more substitutable than other environmental goods — changing the river where a person goes fishing or boating may be less costly than changing the air a person breathes or the water a person drinks.



Unfortunately, economic research on water pollution and its regulation has been limited. An important task for research is to assess which investments in surface‐​water pollution create net benefits and ways to make these investments more effective.

For example, Germany’s socialist SPD party, which is no favorite of mine, has had a few good pragmatic politicians who understood their duty of serving the people and not themselves. I liked some of them.

Democrat Senator Joe Manchin keeps his promise, takes dead aim at Obama’s energy war on America’s backbone blue collar workers. Photo credit: Youtube.
In the US, the Democrats have Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is now speaking up strongly against Obama’s flat-earth-science-based energy policies, which in the end are nothing more than pure pandering to fringe environmentalists. It’s pure stupidity to think that the fate of the planet hinges on a few dozen US coal power plants. China is putting 50 on line each year.
In 2010, I remember doing a piece on Manchin here, where I expressed tones of skepticism. But two and half years later, I’ve seen enough. In my mind Manchin is a politician who keeps his word (at least on energy). He’s got my support. In 2010:
“I’ll take on Washington, and this administration to get the federal government off our backs and out of our pockets. I’ll cut federal spending and I’ll repeal the bad parts of Obamacare. I sued the EPA, and I’ll take dead aim at cap and trade.”

Cap and trade was shot down, and today once again Manchin is stepping up to the front and taking aim at the next job-killer, phony planet-rescue plan.
Manchin will be a key player in the coming defeat of Obama’s announced energy plan. Though many of us were riled up by Obama’s provocative declaration of war on American energy from earlier this week, it is the battle we’ve all been waiting for. Obama’s energy plan was written by a group of fringe environmentalists who refuse to take all societal interests and factors into account. Once the case gets laid out in the coming public discussion, Obama’s energy-inflation plan will be resoundingly rejected. Democrats simply cannot afford to alienate powerhouse states of America’s industrial heartland.
That is not to say that some old coal plants should not be shuttered – they should be. These need to be replaced by new modern plants, or by cleaner-burning, reliable natural gas plants fired with gas gained from fracking. Whatever energy mix arises, it’s important that energy remains cheap, clean and reliable. With today’s innovative technology coal, gas, and oil fit the bill on every front.
Wind and solar energy, on the other hand, are energies that were used back in the Dark Ages, the year 1200.

If you’re sick of ‘woke’ corporations caving to the increasingly extreme demands of noisy far-left activists, you’re not alone. The Morrison government is putting corporate Australia on notice that it sorely needs to get back to its fulfilling its proper function: making money for shareholders, building the economy, and shutting the hell up about social issues.



Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Ben Morton, has lashed business for being seduced by “self-appointed moral guardians” and joining campaigns on social issues rather than on tax and industrial relations.



Mr Morton, who is driving Scott Morrison’s deregulation agenda, used a speech at an Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry event to attack the body for taking campaign advice from GetUp.



GetUp, like Sleeping ~~Bullies~~ Giants, are a tiny clique of leftists who use social-media astroturfing and rivers of dodgy cash to try and bully mainstream Australia into bowing to their extremist agendas, from climate change to LGBTQWERTY ‘rights’. Voters soundly rejected all but one of GetUp’s puppet candidates at the last election.



[Mr Morton] warned corporate leaders they should expect no favours from the government unless they were at the forefront of selling how business-friendly policies will improve the lives of “quiet Australians”.



“Last year I had some things to say about ACCI having the activist group, GetUp, address this summit on how to achieve campaign cut through. I think the expression is: That worked well, didn’t it?”



From Qantas’s endless virtue-signalling on gay marriage (a staggering hypocrisy, given Qantas’s partnerships with gay-hating Middle-Eastern countries), to the AFL hectoring its patrons about ‘wrongspeak’ or imaginary racism, too many corporates have fallen for the left-wing baloney about ‘corporate social responsibility’. Meanwhile, they neglect actual business issues.



Mr Morton said business had “too often” been on the frontline of social issues but “missing in action” on economic debates.



“Too often I see corporate Australia succumb or pander to similar pressures from noisy, highly orchestrated campaigns of elites typified by groups such as GetUp or activist shareholders,” Mr Morton said.



“Business should not be seduced by the noisy elites who try to bend business to their narrow viewpoints.



 **“I have an old fashioned view that business should act honestly and within the law, provide the best possible product or service, and maximise return to their shareholders.**



“So instruct your public affairs units. Instead of pretending you love paying tax or that you’re building electric cars rather than mining coal, or are in the solar panel rather than the oil or gas business, tell your employees and the quiet Australians in their communities – what you can do for them.”



  
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also chimed in, warning them that the government wanted business “step up and focus discussions that led to better outcomes for workers and their families”.



 _The BFD_ has already written about [Harvey Norman’s rejection of diversity quotas](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/at-least-one-ceo-isnt-ready-to-get-woke-and-go-broke/), concentrating instead on the old fashioned business of actually making money rather than getting woke and going broke.



Former Business Council of Australia president and former Transfield chairman Tony Shepherd condemned business leaders who failed to concentrate on their core responsibilities, saying “this whole corporate social­ responsib­ility thing has got out of hand”.



“Companies should look after their employees, their customers, abide by the laws and they should care for the community in which they live in and operate. Harvey Norman are a great example.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHysterical media, politicians, activists and scientists (e.g. Mojib Latif) tried to put the blame for the German flooding earlier this month on man-made climate change. But a recent doctoral dissertation shows that flooding in Southern Germany is very strongly related to solar activity. No correlation is found with CO2.

Flooding catastrophes at the Bavarian Lake Ammer occur predominantly during phases of weak solar activity
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
How has flooding developed over the past? What factors have an impact on the development?
The simplistic assertion that “more CO2 means more flooding” simply does not hold water with respect to the complexity of the subject. Modeling studies should first start by reproducing the history of flooding in the past. There’s plenty of information available on past flooding. A series of research teams have surveyed numerous studies of calibration data.

One of these studies took place at the geo-research center (GFZ) in Potsdam, Germany where Markus Czymzik determined the flooding history of Bavaria’s third largest lake, Lake Ammer, for the last 5000 years using sediment cores as part of his doctorate dissertation. The pdf file of the dissertation (English) can be downloaded at no cost. In his dissertation Czymzik explains why Lake Ammer is especially suitable for this type of study [translated from the German]:
Lake Ammer at the foot of the Alps forms an ideal archive for reconstructing flooding. Detritus material is transported by the Ammer River to the lower basin. The varved sediments allow a reliable detection and dating of microscopic flood layers. Instrumental flooding data of the Ammer and weather datasets of the Hohenpeißenberg Meteorological Observatory enable a calibration of the sediment data.”
Already in 2010 Czymzik together with colleagues had published an article in the journal of Water Resources Research (The paper is also included in the doctorate dissertation p. 10). In it the scientists present the flooding frequency development at Lake Ammer for the past 450 years. Much to their surprise an excellent correlation with solar activity is shown. Always when solar activity was weak was there increased flooding at Lake Ammer. Also in the new paper from February 2013 appearing in the Quaternary Science Reviews the scientists were again able to show this amazing relationship.

Flooding frequency of the Lake Ammer region (bottom) and solar activity (above) (from Czymizik 2012, dissertation). Phases of minimal solar activity are shown with a blue shaded background. Whenever the sun was weak (high C14 values, peak) flooding was more frequent.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve been going over and compiling the German reaction to the IPCC’s Summary Report for Policymakers, which tries to dismiss 15 years of global temperature stagnation and the fact that all its models have been wrong. There’s much to sort through.
If what I’ve seen so far is anything to go by, then from IPCC critics expect nothing less than an international tsunami of criticism and rebuttal in the days, weeks, and months ahead. The summary report itself is a disgrace.
Just one example reaction comes from the Baseler Zeitiung, which I wrote about in my last post.  The Baseler Zeitung commentary by its editor-in-chief Markus Somm is just a taste of what is coming from a large number of German scientists, journalists and leading skeptics.
IPCC AR5 SPM is a rank obscenity
In general these critics can’t believe that science could be so blind, flawed, and ideological. When it comes to science and the responsibilities therein, AR5 SPM is nothing short of a rank obscenity, and so it must be confronted accordingly.
In the days ahead NoTricksZone will be sorting through all the German reaction and bringing you reports about it. There’s no sense in blowing all the powder at once, even though it looks as if there’s going to be an infinite supply of it.
Stay tuned!

Boeing 747 Supertanker Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) in action
AP labels the 2012 Colorado wildfires worst in state history in this story.
My friend and fellow climate skeptic, nationally syndicated radio host Lars Larson, asks some pointed and pertinent questions about what appears to be some of the most idiotic policy ever devised by government. Since we’ve been covering some of the folly of trying to link the fire to global warming, I thought this government folly with trying to put it out would go along with the issues discussed here. – Anthony
He writes in an email to me from Friday:
I have new questions rolling around in my head every day but there are at least four things I know for sure this morning.  This year the U.S. Forest Aervice will spend north of a billion dollars fighting forest fires across America.  Billions of dollars worth of trees owned by the American people will go up in flames.  And a $50 million dollar airplane that could put those fires out faster sits on the ground in Arizona because the U.S. Forest Service refuses to hire Evergreen Aviation.  Now you may be saying, “There must be a good reason”.  That’s what I thought, but then I remembered that government is capable of multibillion dollar stupidity on a daily basis.  The Forest Service offers no explanation whatsoever.  
And evergreen aviation points out that their 747 supertanker fire fighting plane has been hired by Mexico and Israel to fight fires and earned high marks.  It drops ten times as much water as the biggest forest service tanker in use…and does it at half the cost per gallon.  It’s big enough and fast enough to cover fires anywhere in America…and the forest service refuses to use it…and it’s your forests that are going up in flames.
Today’s statement from Evergreen Aviation about why the U.S. Forest service refuses to use its 747 flying supertanker firefighting plane.
http://www.evergreenaviation.com/pdf/Supertanker_Statement_062912.pdf
==========================================================

Date: 6/29/12
Evergreen International Aviation Statement Concerning the Supertanker
We felt compelled to release this statement due to the overwhelming amount of calls we have received concerning the availability of the Evergreen Supertanker. We at Evergreen are saddened by the fire devastation now taking place in many Western US states. For over 60 years, we have supported the US Forest Service in its important mission to battle and control fires, and it is our desire to continue this rich history of service. While our helicopters continue to work fires for the State of Alaska under State contracts, unfortunately, our Boeing 747 Supertanker Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) aircraft awaits activation with the US Forest Service.
We have never been told why we have not been activated by the US Forest Service, so we can only speculate as to why we face this outcome:
1. We were offered a Call-When-Needed (CWN) contract a few years ago by the US Forest
Service (proving our technical viability), but we were never called into action resulting in
a multi-million dollar loss to our company as we were required to maintain and have
flight crew available should we be called. The only contract that will sustain a VLAT
program is an Exclusive-Use contract, which provides an income stream to sustain the
program even if the asset is not utilized. We invested over $50M to develop this asset in
the firm belief that we could better control fires as we proved in Israel and Mexico under
CWN contracts that we could afford to offer at the time.
2. There have been recent changes to the US Forest Service procurement policies. Today,
only small businesses are eligible for contract awards concerning air tanker assets;
Evergreen is not a small business and, therefore, is excluded from consideration for any
award.
3. The US Forest Service’s specification for Next Generation Air Tanker aircraft limits tank
size to 5,000 gallons. The Supertanker’s tanks hold about 20,000 gallons, which is
considered outside the USFS specification. The USFS just awarded contracts to four
small businesses with aircraft equipped with these smaller tanks, and excluded the
Evergreen Supertanker. Since World War II, tank capacities have been in the 3,000 to
5,000 gallon range, yet we continue to face the growing threat from mega fires today. We
believe the Supertanker represents an overwhelming response to this growing threat.
Please contact your state representatives in Washington DC to demand an examination of their current procurement policies concerning VLAT aircraft. The US Forest Service says it best: “Only YOU can prevent wildfires.”

American policy in Central Asia is threatened by Pakistan’s slow surrender to extremism and violence. The growing mistreatment of religious minorities demonstrates that many of Pakistan’s problems are rooted in the spread of hateful and intolerant beliefs. The State Department should cite Pakistan as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.



Islamabad is not the only U.S. ally that persecutes Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities. In fact, most Muslim states mix discrimination, repression, and persecution in varying degrees.



Saudi Arabia is essentially a totalitarian state when it comes to matters of faith. Much of the Christian community has been driven from the new Iraq, and Coptic Christians are coming under increasingly violent attack in Egypt. Among the worst persecutors is Iran, which has been actively brutalizing religious minorities.



But it is Pakistan, perhaps America’s most obvious “frenemy,” that best illustrates why religious persecution is a problem transcending national boundaries. Freedom of conscience, the essence of religious liberty, is a foundation for all other human rights.



A national community that refuses to even accept, let alone defend, those who believe differently is likely to become a source of intolerance, hatred, and violence — which may end up directed well beyond its own country’s boundaries. A government unwilling to protect individuals worshiping and serving their creator, both singly and collectively, is not likely to respect the life, dignity, and freedom of its citizens, and even less so people from other nations. Such a regime certainly will find itself ill‐​equipped to confront the very extremist forces it has previously, even if inadvertently, encouraged.



The ongoing disintegration of Pakistani society was dramatically illustrated by the assassinations of Punjab governor Salman Taseer in January and Religious Minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti in March. Taseer was a Muslim who opposed the religious parties and denounced Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Bhatti, known internationally, also opposed the blasphemy laws and said he was “speaking for the oppressed, marginalized and persecuted Christians and other minorities.” Although a few brave Pakistanis embraced the two men in death, many more, including in Taseer’s own ruling Pakistan People’s Party, stayed silent while extremists praised the murderers.



In such an environment, it should surprise no one to find official support for al‐​Qaeda and other terrorists. While civilian members of the Pakistani government may have had no idea about Osama bin Laden’s presence on Pakistani soil, it beggars belief that members of the military and Inter‐​Services Intelligence (ISI) agency did not know, and did not aid him. A poll last year found that some 60 percent of Pakistanis viewed America as an enemy. Rank‐​and‐​file military attitudes seem little different.



Much of America’s unpopularity results from Washington’s policies. The war in Afghanistan and especially drone attacks in Pakistan have created growing popular hostility.



But the spread of Islamic extremism has created an environment in which violence naturally flourishes. Even if those willing to strike remain a minority, they increasingly receive warm support from religious and other leaders.



In Pakistan, the social environment is toxic. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that “Pakistan continues to be responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.” The Commission pointed to the blasphemy laws which, along with “other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism.”



The State Department’s assessment of religious liberty is equally blunt. Noted State: “Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuse against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government’s failure or delay in addressing religious hostility by societal actors fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.”



Both the Commission and State emphasize the blasphemy laws as a particular problem. Not uncommon around the world, the laws have become a particularly threatening tool of persecution against non‐​Muslims in Pakistan.



In a detailed study released last year, Freedom House concluded: “Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” The extremist Jamiat Ulema‐​e‐​Islam party has even proposed banning the Bible as “blasphemous.”



The majority of those prosecuted for blasphemy are Muslim, but the law is disproportionately deployed against Christians, who also often find themselves targets of vigilante violence. At least 35 Christians charged with blasphemy have been murdered since 1986. “Many others have endured brutal rapes and beatings, while churches, homes and businesses have been ransacked, looted and burned,” added author Lela Gilbert.



Unfortunately, even before the Taseer and Bhatti murders, the situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. Last November the State Department declared: “the number and severity of reported high‐​profile cases against minorities increased” and “organized violence against minorities increased.”



The Commission only last month released its latest assessment: “The religious freedom situation in Pakistan deteriorated greatly during the reporting period.” Despite taking some positive steps, the Zardari government, added the Commission, “has failed to reverse the erosion in the social and legal status of religious minorities and the severe obstacles the majority Muslim community faces to the free discussion of sensitive religious and social issues.”



International Christian Concern, which placed Pakistan in its “Hall of Shame,” noted that Islamabad “absolutely refuses to progress toward a religiously free society.” Or a free society in any other way.



Washington obviously can do little to transform internal Pakistani affairs. But U.S. officials should make this toxic human environment an issue for bilateral discussion. The best way to do so would be to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern, which is warranted under U.S. law when there are “systematic, ongoing, and egregious” violations of religious liberty “engaged in or tolerated” by the relevant government.



A CPC rating requires State to act, such as imposing sanctions, or at least grant a waiver. Even in the latter case the designation should spark an ongoing dialogue and create a continuing threat of action at a time when many Americans, including congressmen, wonder why the U.S. continues to provide Pakistan with billions of dollars annually in foreign aid.



Pakistan’s geopolitical importance inevitably inclines State against holding Islamabad accountable for its dangerous religious climate. The Bush administration made political accommodations in applying the CPC label. However, Pakistan’s very centrality to U.S. policy makes the internal situation especially threatening for Americans as well as Pakistanis. Today the ministries of education and information may be almost as important as those of defense and foreign affairs.



Unless the current government confronts those promoting intolerance, moderate Muslims may vanish along with Christians. Three leading Pakistani Christian leaders issued a statement after Shahbaz Bhatti’s death: “We would also like to appeal to the federal and provincial governments to wake up to the challenge of protection of the citizens of Pakistan. If the country becomes a killing field of the democrat and liberal individuals who exercise their freedom of conscience and expression, it would embolden the criminals trying to take charge of the country.”



If the government is taken over by such “criminals” — or, more specifically, extremists advocating the use of violence — the U.S. and Pakistan risk moving from informal frenemies to formal enemies. The principal concern is not military cooperation in Afghanistan, which America should leave sooner rather than later. The primary issue is a nuclear‐​armed state in the hands of those shaped by a system that celebrates intolerance and murder.



Washington should do its utmost to avoid such a clash. Angering Islamabad today by raising the pressure through a CPC designation today might prove to be the best means to prevent a crisis in relations tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDirkH asked in a comment if I’m keeping any records on the performance of the 12-kW PV system my family installed on our home last year. He thinks the German Weather Service statistics concerning the amount of sunshine in Germany for June seem a little high. First, the sun statistics from the German Weather Service DWD seem to be spot on, and agree with the production of our PV system.
The first half of June was really good – plenty of sunshine. Our system produced over 1000 kwh in the first 18 days alone, with many days producing over 60 kwh. But things got bad starting June 19. The last 10 days have been really terrible. Yesterday was the worst summer day for solar energy I’ve seen so far (only 16 kwh). This month we’ve produced 1325 kwh up to now, which is okay.
Our PV system has a data-logger, but I haven’t taken the time to get it all set up on my PC notebook etc. and so I can’t present you with all these neat graphics. I just write down the result every evening and calculate output each month.
Monthly outputs so far:
Jul 2012: 957 kwh (July 10 – 31)
Aug: 1442
Sep: 1005
Oct: 682
Nov: 300
Dec: 173
Jan 2013: 114
Feb: 339
Mar: 833
Apr: 1211

I’ve spoken to other system operators who have had them a few years, and they tell me this year overall is the worst. It’s been cloudier than usual. Overall our PV system hasn’t performed as well as I hoped. The panels only work at about 75% when it’s too warm, they rarely operate at their rated capacity, even when the sun shines directly on them.
They tell us that the system pays for itself within 9 years or so. But if the power converter breaks down and you have to replace it, then you can add another 2 years. Then there are some maintenance costs, insurance, etc. So if we’re making money after 12 years, I’ll be surprised. Then there’s also the disposal costs. I seriously doubt I’ll be able to just throw everything out along with the household rubbish.
I bought the system only because 1) the person who sold it to us is a customer of ours, and 2) I didn’t want to be forced to pay high feed-in rates to subsidize other PV operators. Unfortunately it’s a screw, or be-screwed situation. Believing that we’re doing something good for the planet is totally idiotic. The feed-in act benefits (if at all) property owners with good southern exposure. The rest get the shaft.
After almost one year of operation my assessment is: I’m a little disappointed, and expected more from it. On a scale of 1 to 7, 1 = extremely satisfied / 7 = extremely disappointed, I’d have to award a score of 4.
By the way, on the other side of town where I live there’s a field covered with solar panels. Yesterday I rode my bike past it and the weeds growing underneath the panels are now starting to come through the gaps between the panels. So it’s possible that in about a week I’ll have another one of those infamous weed-covered PV system photos, like the one I wrote about here. I’ll be going back in a few days with a camera to see if I can get some shots before the owner mows the weeds down.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew York Times environment reporter and believer of potentially catastrophic AGW Andrew Revkin is stunned at Twitter by the behavior of the White House.
Apparently blogger Steve Goddard had left a very factual tweet at the WhiteHouse Twitter page:
Source: stevengoddard.wordpress./
Obviously Goddard’s inconvenient fact was too much for the White House – so they deleted Goddard’s tweet. Andy Revkin, much to his credit, found that type of raw censorship “disturbing”. Here’s what Revkin just tweeted:

It looks like under Obama, society is not open at all. Some may even argue that it has become Stasi-like, especially when one considers the massive scale of the government’s Internet snooping and intrusion. The vibrations that Andy is picking up are not imaginary. He’s right in calling this disturbing.
Sorrowfully, America appears to have departed from what we know is an open society based on democratic principles. All this makes Richard Nixon look like an angel. I’m stunned.

We will post at www.fakegate.org any replies we receive. Previous press releases from The Heartland Institute plus links to dozens of news reports and commentary on Gleick’s transgressions can be reviewed at Fakegate.org. The Heartland Institute is a 28-year-old national nonprofit organization with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Washington, DC. Its mission is to discover, develop, and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems. For more information, visit our Web site or call 312/377-4000. 



February 29, 2012
Dear _________:
On February 27, the Pacific Institute made the following announcement:
The Board of Directors of the Pacific Institute is deeply concerned regarding recent events involving its president, Dr. Peter Gleick, and has hired an independent firm to review the allegations. The Board has agreed to Dr. Gleick’s request for a temporary leave of absence …
The Heartland Institute’s staff, directors, donors, and other victims of Mr. Gleick’s crime look forward to reviewing the outcome of your investigation. Please confirm that you intend to make public the results of your investigation.
I hope that you and the firm you have hired will pay special attention to the documents I have enclosed:

The emails Gleick exchanged with Heartland prior to committing his crime, in which he was respectfully invited to debate Heartland Senior Fellow James M. Taylor on the issue of climate change at Heartland’s anniversary benefit event in August. In these emails, Gleick is informed of Heartland’s policies regarding the confidentiality of its donors and why we adopted that policy. Gleick declined the invitation to debate.


The emails Gleick used to steal documents intended to be read only by members of Heartland’s board of directors. Gleick falsely assumed the identity of a member of Heartland’s board on the same day (January 27) that he declined the invitation to debate climate change with Taylor.


The forged memo Gleick included with the stolen documents and falsely represented, in his message accompanying the documents to 15 allies and journalists, to have come from The Heartland Institute. I have highlighted the forger’s own words, as opposed to text that was copied and pasted from the stolen documents, and included my own analysis of this fraudulent document.


Gleick’s partial confession, in which he admits to having stolen the documents but claims that the memo, which he previously said came from The Heartland Institute, came “in the mail” from an anonymous source. He claims he stole documents because “a rational public debate is desperately needed,” a debate he had just declined to participate in. He offers his “personal apologies to all those affected,” presumably including people he knew his actions had put in harm’s way. He does not say or offer to do anything that would limit or undo the harm he caused.

I hope you will tell me, as you review these documents, if you recognize the author of the highlighted text of the forged memo, and if you believe Gleick received it from an anonymous source, and if you believe Gleick has shown any personal remorse for what he has done.
Finally, please pass along the following questions to the “independent” firm you hired to investigate Gleick:

Did Gleick use Pacific Institute computers to establish the Gmail email account under the name of a Heartland board member?


Did Gleick use Pacific Institute computers to establish the Gmail email account under the name of “heartlandinsider@gmail.com,” which he used to send the fake memo and the stolen documents to 15 media outlets?


Does the investigative firm intend to examine whether Gleick is the author of the fake memo?


Does the outside firm have access to all of the personal computers Gleick may have used to write and send the emails or to write the forged memo?


Is the fake memo or any trace of it on Gleick’s personal computer(s)?


Is the fake memo or any trace of it on the Pacific Institute’s computer system?


Is there evidence (as a blogger says) that the fake memo was scanned into a PDF document on a scanner at the Pacific Institute?


Does the Pacific Institute have possession of the hard copy of the fake memo or the envelope in which it was supposedly sent?


What steps does the Pacific Institute plan to take to preserve these and other documents relevant to the investigation?

Sincerely,
Joseph L. Bast
President
The Heartland Institute

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) recently was interviewed by German trade journal Welt der Fertigung (World of Production) on the subject of climate change.
Since global temperatures have not increased in 15 years, doubts about anthropogenic global warming are now seeping into the fields of engineering and industry, which for years have been major proponents of renewable energy technologies.

Meteorologist Puls, who has over 40 years experience in the field of meteorology and climate, provides us with some interesting insights. What follows are some excerpts.
On the subject of climate being used as an instrument for enacting new taxes and fees, Puls comments…
The anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases is not completely without impact on the climate. The impact however, is relatively small because of physical laws, and is about 0.5°C for a CO2 doubling with respect to today. Early on – around the mid 1980s – politics empowered a pseudo-science called ‘climate protection’. The political motivations were on one hand “world rescue philosophies“, and, on the other hand, fiscal interests via ecological taxes.”
Puls on the mixing of politics and science…
Many of the scientific findings are merely results of a certain “procured science’: ‘whose bread one eats, whose words one speaks,’ is the old saying. And the IPCC itself is a politically founded organization, just as the name says: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.”
On a global climate treaty, Puls is adamant:
There isn’t going to be any international climate treaty.”
On the subject of CO2’s assumed high sensitivity, Puls says that even the IPCC itself concedes…
…that a doubling of CO2 alone can produce only 1°C of warming. Beyond that feedback effects get calculated in. The IPCC reports speak about ‘assumed values’. This is nothing but hypotheses!”
On global temperatures having stagnated for 15 years, Puls says:
The 15-year stop in global warming is now outside the range of climate ‘noise’ and climate models. It is statistically significant. […] from a science point a view, it is sheer absurdity to want to maintain ‘a nice, comfortable, stable climate’ through a few turns of some sort of CO2 control-knob.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




If anthropogenic global warming is not really happening, then how could the whole world have been blindly led to this unbelievable error? Puls answers
I cannot answer that question – but currently psychologists and sociologists are dealing with that: scientific debates about the climate catastrophe, explains Prof. Dr. Norbert Bolz, are nothing more than a ‘civil religion’ coming from the faith of the religions of the mass society. In it prevails priestly fraud.”
On sea level rise:
If the trend continues – and because of numerous factors nobody can really know – then in 100 years we will see a rise of about 25 cm, which won’t be any problem at all.”
Puls also explains that Arctic sea ice has naturally fluctuated in the past and that today’s conditions are nothing unusual. He reminds readers that according to the Alfred Wegener Institute, Antarctica now has “the largest sea ice extent in 40 years!”
On the plausibility of global warming causing cold winters in Europe:
Meteorologically this is sheer absurdity. For more than 100 years we have known that the atmospheric circulation is subject to unpredictable cyclic fluctuations. Simply said: the atmospheric pressure gradient between the Azores and Iceland changes chaotically over the years, which in Europe leads to a series of warmer or colder winters. It has nothing to do with polar ice melt, climate change, and absolutely nothing to do with CO2. […] Why do climate catastrophists, who claim they can foresee the climate 100 years in advance, always come up with such explanations after the fact?”
Puls comments on whether CO2 is really good for plant growth:
CO2 via photosynthesis is truly life elixir: without CO2 there are no crops,  no plants, no animals and also no people because photosynthesis also produces the oxygen in the air that we breath.  The demonizing of CO2 as a pollutant, as a climate-killer, is outright nonsense – scientifically absurd!”
On the sun being a factor on climate change…
Yes, there’s a lot indicating just that. Over the last few years, solar scientists have been gaining more and more the upper hand in the climate debate, and they are crowding out the single cause of CO2. The new literature on this is very comprehensive. ‘Die Kalte Sonne’ [The Neglected Sun] for example led to hysterical allergic reactions among the CO2 climate alarmists. The increasing plausibility of the climate being controlled by solar variation has shaken the established climate institutes that are fixated on CO2.”
On the question of whether climate protection has anything to do with environmental protection, Puls says, “absolutely not!” He then quotes physicist Prof. Horst Malberg:
Clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, clean lakes, rivers, oceans and soil and an intact ecosystem belong to the fundamental human rights. As climate history shows us, a stable climate is not one of those rights.”

The first press release announcement thread is getting big and unwieldy, and some commenters can’t finish loading the thread, so I’m providing this one with some updates.
1. Thanks to everyone who has provided widespread review of our draft paper. There have been hundreds of suggestions and corrections, and for that I am very grateful.  That’s exactly what we hoped for, and can only make the paper better.
Edits are being made based on many of those suggestions. I’ll post up a revised draft in the next day.
2. Some valid criticisms have been made related to the issue of the TOBS data. This is a preliminary set of data, with corrections added for the “Time of Observation” which can in some cases result in double max-min readings being counted if not corrected for. It makes up a significant portion of adjustments prior to homogenization adjustments as seen below in this older USHCN1 graphic. TOBS is the black dotted line.


TOBS is a controversial adjustment. Proponents of the TOBS adjustment (Created by NCDC director Tom Karl) say that it is a necessary adjustment that fixes a known problem, others suggest that it is an overkill adjustment, that solves small problems but creates an even larger one. For example, from a recent post on Lucia’s by Zeke Hausfather, you can see how much adjustments go into the final product.

The question is: are these valid adjustments? Zeke seems to think so, but others do not.  Personally I think TOBS is a sledgehammer used to pound in a tack. This looks like a good time to settle the question once and for all.
Steve McIntyre is working through the TOBS entanglement with the station siting issue, saying “There is a confounding interaction with TOBS that needs to be allowed for…”, which is what Judith Curry might describe as a “wicked problem”. Steve has an older post on it here which can be a primer for learning about it.
The TOBS issue is one that may or may not make a difference in the final outcome of the Watts et al 2012 draft paper and it’s conclusions, but we asked for input, and that was one of the issues that stood out as a valid concern. We have to work through it to find out for sure. Dr. John Christy dealt with TOBS issues in his paper covered on WUWT: Christy on irrigation and regional temperature effects
Irrigation most likely to blame for Central California warming
A two-year study of San Joaquin Valley nights found that summer nighttime low temperatures in six counties of California’s Central Valley climbed about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 3.0 C) between 1910 and 2003. The study’s results will be published in the “Journal of Climate.”
Most interestingly, John Christy tells me that he had quite a time with having to “de-bias” data for his study, requiring looking at original observer reports and hand keying in data.
We have some other ideas. And of course new ideas on the TOBS issue are welcome too.
In other news, Dr. John Christy will be presenting at the Senate EPW hearing tomorrow, for which we hope to provide a live feed. Word is that Dr. Richard Muller will not be presenting.
Again, my thanks to everyone for all the ideas, help, and support!
=============================================================
UPDATE: elevated from a comment I made on the thread – Anthony

Why I don’t think much of TOBS adjustments
Nick Stoke’s explanation follows the official explanation, but from my travels to COOP stations, I met a lot of volunteers who mentioned that with the advent of MMTS, which has a memory, they tended not to worry much about the reading time as being at the station at a specific time every day was often inconvenient.. With the advent of the successor display to the MMTS unit, the LCD display based Nimbus, which has memory for up to 35 days (see spec sheet here http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/dad/coop/nimbus-spec.pdf) they stopped worrying about daily readings and simply filled them in at the end of the month by stepping through the display.
From the manual http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/dad/coop/nimbusmanual.pdf
Daily maximum and minimum temperatures:
· Memory switch and [Max/Min Recall] button give daily
highs and lows and their times
The Nimbus thermometer remembers the highs and lows for
the last 35 days and also records the times they occurred. This
information is retrieved sequentially day by day. The reading
of the 35 daily max/min values and the times of occurrence (as
opposed to the “global” max/min) are initiated by moving the
[Memory] switch to the left [On].
So, people being people, rather than being tied to the device, they tend to do it at their leisure if given the opportunity. One fellow told me (who had a Winneabago parked in is driveway) when I asked if he traveled much, he said he “travels a lot more now”. He had both the CRS and MMTS/Nimbus in his back yard. He said he traveled more now thanks to the memory on the Nimbus unit. I asked what he did before that, when all he had was the CRS and he said that “I’d get the temperatures out of the newspaper for each day”.
Granted, not all COOP volunteers were like this, and some were pretty tight lipped. Many were dedicated to the job. But human nature being what it is, what would you rather do? Stay at home and wait for temperature readings or take the car/Winnebago and visit the grand-kids? Who needs the MMTS ball and chain now that it has a memory?
I also noticed many observers now with consumer grade weather stations, with indoor readouts. A few of them put the weather station sensors on the CRS or very near it. Why go out in the rain/cold/snow to read the mercury thermometer when the memory of the weather station can do it for you.
My point is that actual times of observation may very well be all over the map. There’s no incentive for the COOP observer to do it at exactly the same time every day when they can just as easily do it however they want. They aren’t paid, and often don’t get any support from the local NWS office for months or years at a time. One woman begged me to talk to the local NWS office to see about getting a new thermometer mount for her max/min thermometer, since it wouldn’t lock into position properly and often would screw up the daily readings when it spun loose and reset the little iron pegs in the capillary tube.
Some local NWS personnel I talked to called the MMTS the “Mickey Mouse Temperature System” obviously a term of derision. Wonder why?
So my point in all this is that NWS/NOAA/NCDC is getting exactly what they paid for. And my view of the network is that it is filled with such randomness.
Nick Stokes and people like him who preach to us from on high, never leaving their government office to actually get out and talk to people doing the measurements, seem to think the algorithms devised and implemented from behind a desk overcome human urges to sleep in, visit the grand-kids, go out to dinner and get the reading later, or take a trip.
Reality is far different. I didn’t record these things on my survey forms when I did many of the surveys in 2007/2008/2009 because I didn’t want to embarrass observers. We already had NOAA going behind me and closing stations that were obscenely sited that appeared on WUWT, and the NCDC had already shut down the MMS database once citing “privacy concerns” which I ripped them a new one on when I pointed out they published pictures of observers at their homes standing in front of their stations, with their names on it. For example: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/coop/newsletters/07may-coop.pdf
So I think the USHCN network is a mess, and TOBS adjustments are a big hammer that misses the mark based on human behavior for filling out forms and times they can’t predict. There’s no “enforcer” that will show up from NOAA/NWS if you fudge the form. None of these people at NCDC get out in the field, but prefer to create algorithms from behind the desk. My view is that you can’t model reality if you don’t experience it, and they have no hands on experience nor clue in my view.
More to come…

The next major conflict will be held within 500km of the closest charging point and designated safe-space. Well, I presume that will be the case since the British Army has declared that they are going to switch to EVs to attract eco-friendly climate warriors as recruits.



Calling on British industry to lead the way on developing new sources of energy for the military, he added: “The challenge, and genuine commercial opportunity, is to aim high and lead the world in the development of military equipment which is not only battle-winning but also environmentally sustainable.



“That gives the British Army considerable operational benefits, such as reducing our logistical drag, and also puts the Army […] on the right side of the environmental argument, especially in the eyes of that next generation of recruits that increasingly make career decisions based on a prospective employer’s environmental credentials.”



  
Delingpole, as expected, rips into this:



There is so much stupid here that it is hard to know where to begin.



On the recruitment front, it surely ought to be obvious to almost anyone apart from this wooden-topped Rupert – with his lower second class university degree – that bunny-hugging eco-loons are the very last people ever to want to join the Army. The only thing that might change their dope-addled minds is if it redesignated itself the Peace Corps and renounced its combat role altogether. But that might leave an awkward gap in Britain’s defence capabilities.



Then again, what kind of loon would even want to join a military so careless of its proper purpose that it apparently puts more value on green virtue-signalling than it does on operational effectiveness?



There is currently no renewable energy source that could conceivably power the Army’s military equipment – nor is there likely to be any time soon.



Young men and women prepared to risk their lives for their country need to know that in return, their country is going to do its level best to ensure that they go into battle with best equipment for the job.



Once you start prioritising other goals — appeasing Mother Gaia; trying to get friendly write-ups from the Guardian and the BBC; trying to persuade recruits that war has more to do with saving polar bears than killing the enemy — then you send a very clear message to the taxpayers who fund you: we incapable of defending you properly. And an even clearer message to the enemy: we are not serious so please, walk all over us. […]



All our enemies will now have to do is wait for our tanks to trundle forward for a few miles, maybe leave it till darkness has fallen – then strike the moment their solar batteries have run out.



  
Maybe all the war documentaries and movies that I have seen have painted a false picture? Obliterating a location with bombs, waving flamethrowers about and generally devastating the opponent’s territory has never seemed to be a “battle-winning but also environmentally sustainable” pursuit.



What would a lithium powered tank look like after a hit from an RPG?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming is not a religion, it’s a cult.
Peter Lilley’s commentary deserves broad attention. Here’s how he describes the global warming believers:
THE global warming doomsday cult is coming to an end. … Unfortunately, when doomsday forecasts fail, cult supporters don’t immediately give up. A US social scientist infiltrated a cult whose leader predicted the apocalypse would arrive on 21 December, as would a flying saucer to save her followers. When neither came on the appointed day, most of her followers, far from abandoning the cult, accepted their leader’s message that doom had been postponed and became even more fanatical. So it is with most merchants of global warming doom. Their models forecast that…

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"**More than 3,000 fines have been issued by Welsh police forces for breaches of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, new figures have shown.**
The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said 3,028 fixed penalty notices were issued to people in Wales between 27 March and 16 November.
Dyfed Powys Police, handed out more than half of the fines in the country, with 1,759 notices.
Almost a third of all notices were given to people aged between 18 and 24.
Three-quarters of fines were issued to men.
Of the 3,022 fines in Wales, 2,215 of those related to breaking restrictions on movement.
This amounts to about 73% of all fines in Wales.
English forces issued just under 22,000 fines over the same period.
Elsewhere in Wales, North Wales Police issued 582 fines, South Wales Police gave out 425 and Gwent Police 232. The British Transport Police issued 30.
Over the weekend, South Wales Police was granted extra powers to check for coronavirus breaches in Cardiff.
The force said it stopped more than 200 cars coming into the city and issued eight fixed penalty notices, including to a couple from Essex who said they were dropping off Christmas presents.
It said it had given 69 fines in total over the weekend for various offences, including house parties.
The NPCC also said serious violent crime, shoplifting, vehicle crime and burglary were all lower compared to last year in the four-week period to 25 October.
Its chairman, Martin Hewitt, said: ""Crime is lower than at the same point last year, however the demand on the police service remains significant.
""Particularly during the month of December, officers and police staff will be working hard to tackle crime, keep communities safe, and play our part in reducing the spread of coronavirus.
""We encourage the public to follow the rules in place for their part of the country, and to remain vigilant as shops begin to open again in time for Christmas as criminals may seek to exploit opportunities to commit crime."""

From CSIRO  – Warming in the Tasman Sea a global warming hot spot 
Oceanographers have identified a series of ocean hotspots around the world generated by strengthening wind systems that have driven oceanic currents, including the East Australian Current, polewards beyond their known boundaries.
The hotspots have formed alongside ocean currents that wash the east coast of the major continents and their warming proceeds at a rate far exceeding the average rate of ocean surface warming, according to an international science team whose work is published in the journal Nature Climate Change today.

Paper co-author, CSIRO’s Dr Wenju Cai, said that while the finding has local ecological implications in the region surrounding the hotspots, the major influence is upon the ocean’s ability to take up heat and carbon from the atmosphere.

In Australia’s case, scientists report intensifying east-west winds at high latitudes (45º-55ºS) pushing southward and speeding up the gyre or swirl of currents circulating in the South Pacific, extending from South America to the Australian coast.  The resulting changes in ocean circulation patterns have pushed the East Australian Current around 350 kilometres further south, with temperatures east of Tasmania as much as two degrees warmer than they were 60 years ago.
“We would expect natural change in the oceans over decades or centuries but change with such elevated sea surface temperatures in a growing number of locations and in a synchronised manner was definitely not expected,” said CSIRO’s Dr Wenju Cai.
“Detecting these changes has been hindered by limited observations but with a combination of multi-national ocean watch systems and computer simulations we have been able to reconstruct an ocean history in which warming over the past century is 2-3 times faster than the global average ocean warming rate,” says Dr Cai, a climate scientist at CSIRO’s Wealth from Oceans Research Flagship.
The changes are characterised by a combination of currents pushing nearer to the polar regions and intensify with systematic changes of wind over both hemispheres, attributed to increasing greenhouse gases.
Dr Cai said the increase of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been the major driver of the surface warming of the Earth over the 20th century. This is projected to continue.
He said the research points to the need for a long-term monitoring network of the western boundary currents. In March next year, Australian scientists plan to deploy a series of moored ocean sensors across the East Australian Current to observe change season-to-season and year-to-year.
Lead author of the paper was Dr Lixin Wu, of the Ocean University of China, with contributing authors from five countries, many of whom are members of the Pacific Ocean Panel working under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation.
The research was partly funded by a grant from the Australian Climate Change Science Program supported by the Australian Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.

"**The number of positive cases in a coronavirus outbreak at an ""extra care"" housing development in the Borders has risen to 28.**
Council-run care provider SB Cares said it had ""robust"" plans in place to deal with the situation at Dovecot Court in Peebles.
Sixteen tenants and 12 members of staff have tested positive.
Visiting was suspended at the site earlier this month when the outbreak was first reported.
SB Cares, which provides services at the 37-flat development tailored for elderly people, said it had measures in place in order to ""safely support"" all tenants.
Jen Holland, chief operating officer, said there was no impact on any of its other services in the area.
Eildon Housing, which owns the development, said it was working ""extremely closely"" with its partners in response to the outbreak and was providing tenants with any support needed at a ""challenging time"".
The region's director of public health said that while the level of infections in the Borders remained low compared with other areas it was essential for people to remain ""vigilant"" and follow health advice.
The outbreak was raised at the Scottish government's national daily coronavirus briefing by a reporter who pointed out that a previous outbreak in Jedburgh was linked to SB Cares home services.
National clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he was aware of the outbreak and ""layers of support"" were in place.
""We continue to look after that home and those in it,"" he added.
""We have no reason to believe that this virus, remember, is anybody's fault so trying to find a provider to blame is not really helpful.
""What we want to do is support those providers, using our best public health expertise that we possibly can, to get that home Covid-free just as quickly as we can."""

Don’t believe the hysteria over climate change. It’s more about expanding bureaucratic power than saving the planet. Bjorn Lomborg, Director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, breaks down the facts about the environment and shows why the reality of climate change may be very different from what you hear in the media.

The Hill reports:
A former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official who resigned earlier this year for comparing his work to crucifixion has found new employment with a leading green group.
The Sierra Club on Friday announced that Al Armendariz would be joining the group’s “Beyond Coal” campaign next month as a senior representative.
“As a third generation Texan, I’m proud to be taking on this new role to help protect Texas,” Armendariz said in a statement released by Sierra Club.
…
Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who released the video of the meeting, mockingly offered his congratulations to Armendariz on Friday.  
“Dr. Armendariz follows numerous Obama administration officials who have come from or moved to radical left and green groups,” Inhofe said in a statement. “It’s as if there is a revolving door between the White House and organizations such as the Sierra Club.”
“At least at the Sierra Club he won’t get into so much trouble for telling the truth that their true agenda is to kill oil, gas and coal,” he added.
=========================================================

You may remember this guy and what he said in that video:
“But as I said, oil and gas is an enforcement priority, it’s one of seven, so we are going to spend a fair amount of time looking at oil and gas production. And I gave, I was in a meeting once and I gave an analogy to my staff about my philosophy of enforcement, and I think it was probably a little crude and maybe not appropriate for the meeting but I’ll go ahead and tell you what I said. It was kind of like how the Romans used to conquer little villages in the Mediterranean. They’d go into a little Turkish town somewhere, they’d find the first five guys they saw and they would crucify them. And then you know that town was really easy to manage for the next few years. And so you make examples out of people who are in this case not compliant with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law, and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out of them, and there is a deterrent effect there. And, companies that are smart see that, they don’t want to play that game, and they decide at that point that it’s time to clean up. And, that won’t happen unless you have somebody out there making examples of people. So you go out, you look at an industry, you find people violating the law, you go aggressively after them. And we do have some pretty effective enforcement tools. Compliance can get very high, very, very quickly. That’s what these companies respond to is both their public image but also financial pressure. So you put some financial pressure on a company, you get other people in that industry to clean up very quickly. So, that’s our general philosophy.”
The Sierra Club should be ashamed for hiring this man. But, then again, given their behavior, we’ve seen they don’t seem to have any shame at all.

"**Jersey has seen a ""surge"" of 84 new Covid-19 cases since Friday, according to the latest figures.**
This takes the island to 247 active infections, nearly three quarters of which are symptomatic.
Further public health measures and guidance are now due to follow the introduction of mandatory masks use in shops from Tuesday.
The updated government advice suggests islanders work from home where possible.
Those over the age of 70 will be advised to avoid socialising indoors with people they do not live with.
Public health officials explained the changes were needed as the island was experiencing ""complex, multiple clusters"" and a rise which cannot be attributed to a particular event.
More than 2,000 people, nearly 2% of Jersey's population, are isolating as a result of contact tracing, Chief Minister John Le Fondre confirmed.
The full list of measures to be introduced include:
Senator John Le Fondre said: ""This surge in cases is not down to one cluster.
""Health officials are seeing case clusters on a larger scale, and we are worried that the number of positive cases being picked up may indicate an increase in hospitalisation as we move forward.
""In the coming weeks we will see large numbers of returning students, family members and friends visiting for Christmas and enhanced social activity.
""Action is needed now to protect the vulnerable, to identify more cases earlier on and to slow the spread.""
Health Minister Richard Renouf said: ""If this doesn't bring down the numbers of positive cases we may, ultimately, have to move to another lockdown.""
""That's something none of us want to see,"" he added."
"A new form of politics is gaining steam as a solution to the climate crisis. Six parliamentary committees in the UK are to commission a citizens’ assembly, in which randomly selected citizens will consider how to combat climate breakdown and achieve the pathway to net zero emissions.  This unexpected move complements increasing experimentation with assemblies across the world. Having struggled to realise necessary action on climate breakdown through traditional routes, citizen assemblies could well help governments kick-start the tough but urgently needed steps to safeguard a healthy and stable world. In a nutshell, these assemblies bring together 50 or more citizens over a number of days or weeks to learn about a particular policy challenge, deliberate together and recommend how to deal with it. Citizens are selected to reflect the demographic diversity of the population. The process is typically facilitated by an independent and apolitical organisation, which brings in experts across a wide range of disciplines, as well as competing interest groups and the voices of those personally affected by the issue in question.  A growing evidence base suggests that this form of participatory politics works. The balanced and structured process of deliberation results in more informed preferences. A requirement to justify opinions, for example, counteracts the bias of prior beliefs. Opinions tend to be neither polarised nor uniform, with participants developing increased respect and understanding for opposing viewpoints. Such a respectful and deliberative context gives rise to considered judgements that can cut through political deadlock on even the most complex and contentious issues. Most famously, Ireland used such an assembly to decide on the constitutional status of abortion. Bridging charged emotions on both sides, the assembly confidently recommended liberalisation, which was backed by a national referendum and enshrined into law. Evidence from citizens’ assemblies and similar deliberative processes suggests that the broader public have confidence in the judgements of such bodies, especially when compared to traditional political institutions. This is true even of populist-minded voters, who appreciate that decisions are being made by citizens like themselves. As a particularly politically divisive issue, citizens’ assemblies could be vital in uniting populations around the challenges of responding to the climate breakdown – but the devil is in the detail. Past assemblies offer valuable lessons in how they can most effectively address the climate emergency. Ireland is the only country to have already run a national citizens’ assembly that addressed climate breakdown. The assembly considered a wide and diverse range of issues from transport to peat extraction – but only had two weekends to do so. This was not enough time to consider these challenges in depth, and made it easier for the government to drop more controversial proposals, such as the significant reduction of agricultural emissions. Given the diverse areas of policy that the climate crisis cuts across, it would be a herculean task for a single assembly to deal with. The amount of time it would take to consider issues in enough depth would place excessive demands on the selected citizens. Aspects of the climate crisis can be treated individually, as successful citizen assemblies and other similar deliberative models in the US, Australia, Canada, and the Polish city of Gdansk have shown. An alternative would be to run separate assemblies in parallel, each considering a digestible chunk of the agenda, with time set aside for assemblies to coordinate with each other when cross-cutting issues emerge. This has never been done before, but nor have humans ever encountered a problem of the scale of climate breakdown.  More radically, citizens’ assemblies on the climate emergency may need to be empowered to make binding decisions, not just advisory recommendations. Politicians are in a bind: they know that they need to act, but are constrained by their concerns over a public backlash and vested social and economic interests that profit from the status quo. Radical policy suggestions emerging from these assemblies are likely to be watered down – as may have been the case in Ireland, whose strong agricultural lobby cannot be ignored. Empowering assemblies could break political deadlocks on climate. In Poland for example, activist Marcin Gerwin successfully persuaded city mayors to implement any decision supported by 80% of an assembly, with the mayor having discretion when support is below that threshold. Resulting changes have for instance helped the city respond faster to severe flooding. Social movement Extinction Rebellion has been quick to criticise the proposed assembly in the UK for lacking such power. As it stands, the plans fall short of the direct action movement’s demand for a citizens’ assembly to have authority to tackle both the climate and biodiversity emergencies.  But the UK citizens’ assembly on climate breakdown can be seen as a positive development. The details of how focused the task will be, including whether the assembly will be empowered to consider a more demanding transition than the government’s current 2050 target, are yet to be made public. Nor do we know how much time the assembly will have to deliberate. And while it is primarily structured to inform parliamentary committees, its high profile means it could make a real difference to climate policy. If successful, it may well give rise to the type of empowered citizens’ assemblies that bring the wisdom of citizens fully to bear on the climate and ecological emergency.

No country has been a stronger magnet for foreign direct investment than the United States. Valued at $3.5 trillion, the U.S. stock of inward foreign direct investment accounted for 17 percent of the world total in 2011, more than triple the share of the next largest destination.



Foreign direct investment is ultimately a judgment by the world’s value creators about a country’s institutions, policies, human capital, and prospects. As the world’s largest economy, the United States has been able to attract the investment needed to produce the innovative ideas, revolutionary technologies, and new products and industries that have continued to undergird its position atop the global economic value chain.



But the past is not necessarily prologue. Indeed, while the U.S. claim to 17 percent of the world’s stock of foreign direct investment is impressive, the share stood at 39 percent as recently as 1999. It has been 12 years since the annual value of U.S. inward FDI set a record high of $314 billion, and since then, annual flows have failed to establish an upward trend. The most recent figures show a decline of 35 percent, from $227 billion in 2011 to $147 billion in 2012.



To a large extent, these trends reflect the emergence of new, viable destinations for investment resulting from inevitable demographic, economic, and political changes. However, some of the decline is attributable to a deteriorating U.S. investment climate, as reflected on a variety of renowned business surveys and investment indices measuring policy and perceptions of policy.



The current U.S. business environment conspires to deter inward investment and to encourage companies to offshore operations that could otherwise be performed competitively in the United States. A proper accounting of these policies, followed by implementation of reforms to remedy shortcomings, will be necessary if the United States is going to compete effectively for the investment required to fuel economic growth and higher living standards.

"Australian taxpayers should underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry – including helping open new fields and build hundreds of kilometres of pipelines – according to a group advising on Covid-19 recovery. A leaked draft report by a manufacturing taskforce advising the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) recommends the Morrison government make sweeping changes to “create the market” for gas and build fossil fuel infrastructure that would operate for decades. Its vision includes Canberra underwriting an increased national gas supply, government agencies partnering with companies to accelerate development of new fields such as the Northern Territory’s vast Beetaloo Basin, and states introducing subsidy schemes for gas-fired power plants. It says the federal government should help develop gas pipelines between eastern states and the north, and potentially a $6bn trans-Australian pipeline between the east and west, by either taking an equity position, minority share or underwriting investments. The taskforce, headed by the former Dow Chemical executive and current Saudi Aramco and Worley board member Andrew Liveris, positions lower-cost gas as the answer to building a transformed manufacturing sector that it says could support at least 85,000 direct jobs, and hundreds of thousands more indirectly. But it does not consider alternatives to gas, or what happens if greenhouse gas emissions are cut as promised under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Gas is usually described as having half the emissions of coal when burned, though recent studies have suggested it could be more. The Liveris report does not mention climate change, Australia’s emissions reduction targets or the financial risk, flagged by institutions in Australia and overseas, of investing in fossil fuel as emissions are cut. While several assessments have found renewable energy backed by storage is likely now the cheapest option for new electricity generation, the report says gas is “key to driving down electricity cost and improving investment in globally competitive advanced industry”. Its focus is consistent with the NCCC chairman, Nev Power, a former Fortescue Metals chief and current board member at gas company Strike Energy, who has said in interviews that cheap gas would be critical to Australia’s future. Gas has been strongly backed by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has argued for a gas-fired recovery from the pandemic. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing investors managing $2tn in assets, said the taskforce’s proposals could expose Australia to future economic shocks and billions of dollars in public and private sector investment being wasted as global markets moved to cut emissions. “With the commission now making recommendations for decades-long economic, energy and industry policy, it must be required to integrate Australia’s long-term climate change commitments under the Paris agreement and consider all net-zero emissions options for recovery,” Herd said. “With the flow of international capital increasingly swinging to renewable energy, greener industry and electrified transport, all options to capitalise on this potential investment must be fully explored.” Taylor was asked on Wednesday if he supported the idea, raised in an interview by Power with the Australian Financial Review, of a pipeline to bring gas from Western Australia to eastern states. He said people were getting ahead of themselves. “What I do support very strongly is a strong gas market in Australia. That means having strong pipelines and strong investments in pipelines, and a good network of pipelines around Australia to support that,” Taylor told the ABC. The NCCC did not directly respond to questions on whether it had considered alternatives to gas, and the basis for the taskforce’s claim that it was key to reducing electricity prices. A spokesman said its focus was currently on supporting businesses to reopen. He said the NCCC had liaised with more than a thousand stakeholders, including some with renewable energy expertise, and the manufacturing taskforce was one of several working groups it had set up. Options for economic recovery would be provided to government in due course. In the draft report, the taskforce says its recommendations on gas aim to correct “market failures of our current energy supply”. It says an expanded gas industry should work closely with a developing hydrogen industry and Australia could become a world leader in exporting hydrogen developed with renewable energy and gas. Other recommendations from the taskforce include: Considering tax incentives for priority gas infrastructure. Lifting remaining gas exploration moratoria in New South Wales and Victoria, and easing regulations in the Northern Territory to allow quicker access to new supply from the massive Beetaloo Basin. Using a reverse auction “contract-for-difference” scheme, such as that used for wind and solar in Victoria, for state governments to buy gas-fired power at lowest cost. Providing support, such as low-cost capital, for existing small and medium-sized gas companies to invest. Rapidly cutting regulations, described as “green and red tape”, to allow developments. Introducing gas reservation policies for the NT and east coast developments, as exist in Western Australia, to ensure not all gas is exported. On electricity generation, the taskforce says gas-fired power is central to more rapid adoption of renewable energy at lowest cost, and could contribute 10-15% of total generation as back-up for wind and solar as coal declines. If gas prices stay low, it says combined-cycle gas generation – a form of “baseload” power that the federal government has not backed as part of the future – would “likely expand significantly”. Its assessment that gas is necessary to support variable clean energy is at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator, which last year listed pumped hydro, batteries and “demand-side participation” schemes, which offer energy users cash to cut down consumption when needed, as potentially cheaper alternatives. The government’s push for gas escalated as the price plunged from about $12 a gigajoule to about $4. Analysts have said future investment will in part depend on whether it can settle at about $6. The NCCC taskforce says a huge government emphasis on gas development could keep it at $4 a gigajoule in the long term, below what most assessments have considered likely. Bruce Robertson, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the government risked backing a losing industry. He said major gas companies were losing money, and consultants Rystad had found 67% of Australia’s discovered but undeveloped gas reserves were currently uneconomic. “Governments are not meant to back winners, but they’re certainly not meant to back losers,” he said. Morrison established the NCCC in late March to advise the government on non-health aspects of its pandemic response. Its terms of reference were not published until May, and it has a broad remit. Concerns have been raised about its lack of transparency and the absence of a conventional governance framework for a taxpayer-funded enterprise. A Senate inquiry into the Covid-19 response last week heard Liveris, who is considered a special adviser to the NCCC, was not subject to the conflict of interest declarations that other commissioners faced. The NCCC’s chief executive, Peter Harris, said the manufacturing taskforce was “appended to the commission” and the group was “set up in an informal manner”. He said he did not believe Liveris was being paid for his advice. Harris said it was unclear how the manufacturing group’s advice would progress through government decision making after being handed to the NCCC. Analyses before Covid-19 hit suggested the government was not on track to meet the 2030 emissions target, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, without using a carbon accounting loophole. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found global emissions need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050 to give the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C."
"What to do, when two of Britain’s most loved animals run up against each other? In a study recently published in the journal PLOS One, we found that the numbers of hedgehogs living in suburban areas in rural England doubled following the reduction in badger numbers through culling. This research points to the badger, widely popular in certain quarters but of major concern in others, having a significant impact on the hedgehog, Britain’s best loved mammal.  The Defra-funded research was part of a wider project to evaluate the ecological consequences of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) conducted between 1998 and 2006. This long-running operation met with stiff resistance from many conservation and animal welfare groups. But it did offer an unrivalled opportunity to study the impact that an important predator has on prey and competitor species.  This type of research is particularly important as it provides information upon which to base conservation and environmental management decisions. This is particularly the case in areas that are extensively managed or affected by human activity, which leaves them missing many parts of their original food webs. For example, where large predators are missing (wolves, for example), medium-sized predators left unchallenged can have other knock-on ecological impacts.  One such predator, the badger, has long been known to prey on hedgehogs. This isn’t necessarily a cause for concern, as predator-prey relationships are natural and essential parts of functioning ecosystems. Hedgehogs and badgers have co-existed for millennia in Britain – well before the arrival of humans, and in the thousands of years since. However studies during the 1990s showed that where badger density was high they may have a profound effect on hedgehog numbers and their ability to move around the landscape. Animal rescue and rehabilitation organisations discovered that badgers were causing high rates of mortality among hedgehogs released back into the wild in some areas. Evidence from two citizen science surveys, run by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species over the past decade, point to a substantial national decline in hedgehog numbers. There are many suspects behind this decline – habitat loss and fragmentation as towns and villages expand, the loss of hedgerows which provide them cover and nesting sites, warmer winters and drier springs that disrupt their hibernation and invertebrate prey species, pesticides, roadkill, and a thriving badger population. But without a robust long-term national hedgehog monitoring scheme, it’s very difficult to determine the precise timing and cause. In the early-2000s, a team of us investigated patterns in hedgehog and badger populations across hundreds of square kilometres of rural southwest England and the midlands. One important finding was that hedgehogs appeared to be absent from large swathes of pastoral grasslands where they are thought to have once been commonplace. Instead we found that hedgehogs had moved almost exclusively into the villages and towns within these landscapes. It was also apparent that the likelihood of finding hedgehogs in parks and gardens declined as the density of badger setts nearby increased. But is this correlation, or is it causation? To address this question, we surveyed hedgehogs in a number of areas which were geographically and ecologically similar, but with different levels of badger culling. Hedgehog numbers in suburban areas doubled during the five years of badger culling, and remained static in areas without culling. This demonstrated for the first time that badger predation is a strong limiting factor for hedgehog populations in these particular habitats. But badgers and hedgehogs have always co-existed in Britain, why might there be an issue now? Until the mid to late 20th century, heavy persecution of badgers kept them at low numbers. The Badgers Act of 1973 introduced protections, enhanced by the 1992 Protection of Badgers Act. Consequently surveys published in January revealed that in the 25 years since the first survey in 1985-88, the number of badger social groups in England has doubled to around 71,600. In pasture-dominated and mixed agricultural landscapes, and in some suburban habitats, badgers thrive with have plentiful denning opportunities and abundant food resources. The largest increases in the density of badger social groups have occurred in the landscapes that dominate southern, western and eastern England. These are also the areas where hedgehog declines are likely to be most severe. So while there is evidence that increasing badger populations play a significant role in the hedgehog’s decline, the relative weight of the impact of badgers against the other many factors likely affecting hedgehogs is far from clear. Even with evidence of this link, it does not necessarily follow that badger culling would, or should, play any role in tackling the decline of the hedgehog. Given a multitude of ecological, social, practical, financial and legal reasons, it is impossible to see how it could ever be part of any conservation strategy.  Rather, we need to understand how to manage our countryside in a more ecologically informed and progressive manner, acknowledging that there are bound to be many trade-offs along the way. This could include creating habitats such as very large areas of woodland that could favour hedgehogs over badgers, besides offering significant environmental and social value for us.  We should also consider more radical solutions, such as restoring the ecologically important elements of our ecosystems that we are missing – such as larger predators, including brown bears and lynx – as is happening in mainland Europe. That two of Britain’s most recognisable species should appear to be pitted against each other in this way may just be what’s needed to prompt a debate on how we can encourage greater diversity, in form, content and function, in our rural landscapes for the future."

American policy in Central Asia is threatened by Pakistan’s slow surrender to extremism and violence. The growing mistreatment of religious minorities demonstrates that many of Pakistan’s problems are rooted in the spread of hateful and intolerant beliefs. The State Department should cite Pakistan as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.



Islamabad is not the only U.S. ally that persecutes Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities. In fact, most Muslim states mix discrimination, repression, and persecution in varying degrees.



Saudi Arabia is essentially a totalitarian state when it comes to matters of faith. Much of the Christian community has been driven from the new Iraq, and Coptic Christians are coming under increasingly violent attack in Egypt. Among the worst persecutors is Iran, which has been actively brutalizing religious minorities.



But it is Pakistan, perhaps America’s most obvious “frenemy,” that best illustrates why religious persecution is a problem transcending national boundaries. Freedom of conscience, the essence of religious liberty, is a foundation for all other human rights.



A national community that refuses to even accept, let alone defend, those who believe differently is likely to become a source of intolerance, hatred, and violence — which may end up directed well beyond its own country’s boundaries. A government unwilling to protect individuals worshiping and serving their creator, both singly and collectively, is not likely to respect the life, dignity, and freedom of its citizens, and even less so people from other nations. Such a regime certainly will find itself ill‐​equipped to confront the very extremist forces it has previously, even if inadvertently, encouraged.



The ongoing disintegration of Pakistani society was dramatically illustrated by the assassinations of Punjab governor Salman Taseer in January and Religious Minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti in March. Taseer was a Muslim who opposed the religious parties and denounced Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Bhatti, known internationally, also opposed the blasphemy laws and said he was “speaking for the oppressed, marginalized and persecuted Christians and other minorities.” Although a few brave Pakistanis embraced the two men in death, many more, including in Taseer’s own ruling Pakistan People’s Party, stayed silent while extremists praised the murderers.



In such an environment, it should surprise no one to find official support for al‐​Qaeda and other terrorists. While civilian members of the Pakistani government may have had no idea about Osama bin Laden’s presence on Pakistani soil, it beggars belief that members of the military and Inter‐​Services Intelligence (ISI) agency did not know, and did not aid him. A poll last year found that some 60 percent of Pakistanis viewed America as an enemy. Rank‐​and‐​file military attitudes seem little different.



Much of America’s unpopularity results from Washington’s policies. The war in Afghanistan and especially drone attacks in Pakistan have created growing popular hostility.



But the spread of Islamic extremism has created an environment in which violence naturally flourishes. Even if those willing to strike remain a minority, they increasingly receive warm support from religious and other leaders.



In Pakistan, the social environment is toxic. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that “Pakistan continues to be responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.” The Commission pointed to the blasphemy laws which, along with “other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism.”



The State Department’s assessment of religious liberty is equally blunt. Noted State: “Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuse against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government’s failure or delay in addressing religious hostility by societal actors fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.”



Both the Commission and State emphasize the blasphemy laws as a particular problem. Not uncommon around the world, the laws have become a particularly threatening tool of persecution against non‐​Muslims in Pakistan.



In a detailed study released last year, Freedom House concluded: “Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” The extremist Jamiat Ulema‐​e‐​Islam party has even proposed banning the Bible as “blasphemous.”



The majority of those prosecuted for blasphemy are Muslim, but the law is disproportionately deployed against Christians, who also often find themselves targets of vigilante violence. At least 35 Christians charged with blasphemy have been murdered since 1986. “Many others have endured brutal rapes and beatings, while churches, homes and businesses have been ransacked, looted and burned,” added author Lela Gilbert.



Unfortunately, even before the Taseer and Bhatti murders, the situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. Last November the State Department declared: “the number and severity of reported high‐​profile cases against minorities increased” and “organized violence against minorities increased.”



The Commission only last month released its latest assessment: “The religious freedom situation in Pakistan deteriorated greatly during the reporting period.” Despite taking some positive steps, the Zardari government, added the Commission, “has failed to reverse the erosion in the social and legal status of religious minorities and the severe obstacles the majority Muslim community faces to the free discussion of sensitive religious and social issues.”



International Christian Concern, which placed Pakistan in its “Hall of Shame,” noted that Islamabad “absolutely refuses to progress toward a religiously free society.” Or a free society in any other way.



Washington obviously can do little to transform internal Pakistani affairs. But U.S. officials should make this toxic human environment an issue for bilateral discussion. The best way to do so would be to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern, which is warranted under U.S. law when there are “systematic, ongoing, and egregious” violations of religious liberty “engaged in or tolerated” by the relevant government.



A CPC rating requires State to act, such as imposing sanctions, or at least grant a waiver. Even in the latter case the designation should spark an ongoing dialogue and create a continuing threat of action at a time when many Americans, including congressmen, wonder why the U.S. continues to provide Pakistan with billions of dollars annually in foreign aid.



Pakistan’s geopolitical importance inevitably inclines State against holding Islamabad accountable for its dangerous religious climate. The Bush administration made political accommodations in applying the CPC label. However, Pakistan’s very centrality to U.S. policy makes the internal situation especially threatening for Americans as well as Pakistanis. Today the ministries of education and information may be almost as important as those of defense and foreign affairs.



Unless the current government confronts those promoting intolerance, moderate Muslims may vanish along with Christians. Three leading Pakistani Christian leaders issued a statement after Shahbaz Bhatti’s death: “We would also like to appeal to the federal and provincial governments to wake up to the challenge of protection of the citizens of Pakistan. If the country becomes a killing field of the democrat and liberal individuals who exercise their freedom of conscience and expression, it would embolden the criminals trying to take charge of the country.”



If the government is taken over by such “criminals” — or, more specifically, extremists advocating the use of violence — the U.S. and Pakistan risk moving from informal frenemies to formal enemies. The principal concern is not military cooperation in Afghanistan, which America should leave sooner rather than later. The primary issue is a nuclear‐​armed state in the hands of those shaped by a system that celebrates intolerance and murder.



Washington should do its utmost to avoid such a clash. Angering Islamabad today by raising the pressure through a CPC designation today might prove to be the best means to prevent a crisis in relations tomorrow.

A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report claims that, among other issues, the Border Patrol is not efficiently deploying agents to maximize the interdiction of drugs and illegal immigrants at interior checkpoints. I wrote about this here. These checkpoints are typically 25 to 100 miles inside of the United States and are part of a “defense in depth” strategy that is intended to deter illegal behavior along the border. Border Patrol is making suboptimal choices with scarce resources when it comes to enforcing laws along the border. A theme throughout the GAO report is that Border Patrol does not have enough information to efficiently manage checkpoints. Contrary to the GAO’s findings, poor institutional incentives better explain Border Patrol inefficiencies, while a lack information is a result of those incentives. More information and metrics can actually worsen Border Patrol efficiency.   
  
_Inefficient Border Patrol Deployments_   
  
Border Patrol enforces laws in a large area along the border with Mexico. They divide the border into nine geographic sectors. They further divide each sector into stations that are further subdivided into zones, some of which are “border zones” that are actually along the Mexican border while the remainder are “interior zones” that are not along the border. The GAO reports that this organization allows officials on the zone level to deploy agents in response to changing border conditions and intelligence.   
  
The GAO states that Headquarters deploys Border Patrol agents to border sectors based on threats, intelligence, and the flow of illegal activity. The heads of each sector then allocate agents to specific stations and checkpoints based on the above factors as well as local ones such as geography, climate, and the proximity of private property. The heads of those stations and checkpoints then assign specific shifts to each agent. The time it takes for a Border Patrol agent to respond to reported activity, their proximity to urban areas where illegal immigrants can easily blend in, and road access all factor into these deployment decisions.   




All of the above factors that managers and supervisors consider for deployment are reasonable but it is still a management black box. How much does each of these factors matter in determining deployments? Does the relative importance of each factor shift over time or between sectors? How can we tell if one set of decisions is consistently better than another set?   
  
The GAO and other organizations always suggest the same solution to illuminate the black box of Border Patrol agent management decisions: more information. The Border Patrol has about 19,500 agents, about 43 percent of whom can be deployed in the field at any given time, and 143 checkpoint locations along the Southwest border. The GAO has access to extensive data on Border Patrol deployments from the Border Patrol Enforcement Tracking System (BPETS), GPS coordinates for some enforcement operations, seizure information, and the time use of Border Patrol agents by sector when they are on duty. Border Patrol likely has more information available that GAO has not analyzed.   
  
Yet, more information is always insufficient at gauging the efficiency of agent deployment at checkpoints. The recent GAO report notes that “checkpoints’ role in apprehensions and seizures is difficult to measure with precision because of long-standing data quality issues” that the GAO first complained about in 2009. Checkpoints did not consistently report apprehensions as some included any apprehension within a 2.5-mile radius of a checkpoint as apprehended _by_ the checkpoint, while others had different definitional radii and reporting standards. As a result, the number of apprehensions and seizures cannot be determined. The data reporting “issues continue to affect how Border Patrol monitors and reports on checkpoint performance results” despite several memoranda that were supposed to remedy the data collection issues. Border Patrol finally created the Checkpoint Program Management Office (CPMO) in 2016 that is supposed to remedy data collection inconsistencies.   
  
The GAO report calls for more detailed information, such as distinguishing whether an illegal immigrant detention occurs “at” rather than “around” a Border Patrol checkpoint. The GAO also suggests accurate “workplace planning needs assessments” to make sure that checkpoints are manned and operated properly. GAO asks Border Patrol to implement internal controls to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and completeness to overcome problems like supervisors who are not required to update BPETS if their actual deployments differ from those planned and recorded in BPETS. Border Patrol should also study the impact of checkpoints on local communities when considering agent deployment. Finally, GAO reiterates its call for an accurate “workplace planning needs assessment” to make sure that checkpoints are manned and operated properly. How Border Patrol is supposed to integrate these new metrics with existing metrics is a mystery.   
  
_The Incentive to Patrol the Border_   
  
Government law enforcement agencies do have difficult or, in many cases, impossible jobs. Interrupting supply and demand by stopping the flow of unlawful drugs and illegal immigrants into the United States is as Sisyphean a task as Soviet criminal investigators who attempted to stop the black market in gasoline or food. More information won’t remedy the agent deployment problems at Border Patrol, CBP, or any other government agency. The problem with these agencies is not a lack of information but bad incentives.   
  
The performance of government agents isn’t measured by profit and loss as it is in the private sector but by political factors. In the language of economics, Border Patrol faces a principal-agent problem. Principals are the owners and the agents work for them. That sounds simple enough but principals and agents have different incentives. For instance, principals in private enterprise want to maximize profit while many of their agents (workers) want compensation for doing as little as possible or diverting resources into their own pockets. Principals thus have to structure compensation and manage in such a way as to align the incentives of workers and employees through profit sharing, other financial incentives, or through myriad other ways to mitigate these problems. Information is vital to mitigating a principal-agent problem (it can never be fully solved) but more information by itself without the incentive to use it wisely is wasted.   
  
The Border Patrol principals are the politicians who ultimately determine its budget and appoint the heads of the organization. The incentive of the principals is to stay in elected office by winning elections. Border Patrol employees are the agents who supposedly work for the principals. Satisfying political constituencies has little to do with actually enforcing the law as written. For instance, enforcement of immigration laws typically declines during times of economic growth because businesses demand more workers and labor unions complain less about illegal immigrant workers. No lobbying of Congress is necessary, merely the reactions of Border Patrol employees to changing economic circumstances in anticipation of what they think politicians want.   
  
What those politicians want changes over time based on what they think the electorate wants. In the past, economic growth was a better predictor of immigration enforcement. Now, immigration-induced changes in local demographics, cultural complaints, and the idea that immigrants and their descendants will vote against incumbent political parties also drive support for immigration enforcement. Thus, removing illegal immigrants is the latest iteration of the Curley Effect. Countering this trend are pro-immigration local policies like Sanctuary Cities, as well as states like Illinois and California that restrict local police cooperation with federal law enforcement.   
  
_More Information Can Worsen Management_   
  
The call for more information and better metrics for measuring border security is well intentioned but it can also backfire. Some information is required to make accurate decisions but, beyond a certain point, too much information can produce information overload, whereby decisions become _less_ accurate as the decision maker learns more (Figure 1). Information beyond the overload point will confuse a decision maker, affect his or her ability to set priorities, and worsen recall of prior information. A fundamental concept in economics is scarcity, which occurs when there is not enough supply of a good to satisfy all demand at a price of zero. Information overload is a reminder that human attention span, information processing capacity, and accurate decision-making ability are also scarce resources.   
  
Figure 1   
  
Information Overload as the Inverted U-Curve   






_Source:_ _Martin J. Eppler and Jeanne Mengis._   
  
Information overload can take several forms. Some scholars emphasize how much time it takes to absorb new information, which can diminish the accuracy of decisions that require timely action. That case is most similar to the timeliness of intelligence reports in guiding Border Patrol agent deployment. The value of most intelligence depreciates rapidly and, if it is accurate, must be quickly acted upon to have an effect. Other scholars focus on the quality of information, as it is difficult to measure that without first absorbing it and comparing it to other information. Estimates of the size of black markets, a crucial metric for Border Patrol, are fraught with errors and it is nearly impossible to tell which one is correct. Tasks that are reoccurring routines produce less information overload than more complex and varied tasks. As mentioned above, the organizational design of a firm is another important factor that influences information overload.   
  
Smugglers and illegal immigrants compound the problem of information overload as they change their behavior in response to Border Patrol policies. Smugglers and illegal immigrants rarely want to be apprehended so they shift away from patrols or areas where there is more enforcement. In the mid-2000s, illegal Mexican border crossers moved east from California and west from Texas into Arizona because of border security. More enforcement in Arizona after 2010 then shifted illegal immigrant entry attempts back east toward Texas. Their constant movement and reaction to Border Patrol and immigration enforcement generally creates more complexity and information that the agency must process.   
  
The symptoms of information overload are a lack of perspective, cognitive strain and stress, a greater tolerance for error, low morale, and the inability to use information to make a decision. Those symptoms are all common at Border Patrol and its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security. In terms of a lack of perspective, the chaos below the border is a supposed “existential threat.” Meanwhile, the tolerance for performance and discipline problems in Border Patrol personnel has festered for over a decade, producing numerous errors of all kinds. Morale has historically been low in Border Patrol and has only risen recently due to the election of President Trump.   
  
One common reaction to information overload is that decision makers become highly selective, ignore vast amounts of information, and cherry pick that information which confirms their biases. Information never speaks for itself and it must always be interpreted and applied. By increasing the quantity of information available to managers and supervisors at Border Patrol, their actions could become more erratic and less efficient because they will be able to pull from a vaster array of justifications for their decisions. Like any other self-interested actors, Border Patrol will always select and interpret information to justify the actions they want to undertake while discounting information that supports another course of action. The principal-agent problem means that this rarely gets corrected.   
  
For instance, 9.4 percent of Border Patrol hours were spent manning checkpoints from 2013–2016. Yet those checkpoints were only responsible for, _at most_ , 3.1 percent of all illegal immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol in those years and 5.4 percent of all marijuana seizures by weight (Figure 2). That might look like an inefficient allocation of Border Patrol agents, but a smart manager can always argue the opposite by saying, as an example, “we don’t catch many illegal immigrants at checkpoints because checkpoints are so effective at deterring illegal immigrants from even trying to use to the road. Imagine how many there’d be without the checkpoints!” That manager would have a good point.

Percent of Illegal Immigrant Apprehensions & Drug Seizures Made by Border Patrol by Location, 2013–2016   
  
  




_Source:_ _Government Accountability Office_ _, p. 41._   
  
A border wall that diverts illegal immigrants into the interior and away from cities can be used as support for a longer wall to “extend the gains” or as support for no wall at all because “illegal immigrants are just diverted to more remote areas where agents now have to patrol with greater hazards.” More information and data could worsen the decisions made by Border Patrol managers.   
  
_Back to Incentives_   
  
Firms employ countermeasures to information overload, such as better technology and algorithms to select the best data, but the countermeasures are only effective if the managers want to make more accurate decisions. The desire to make accurate decisions in a large organization comes back to incentives, which government agencies have a very difficult time aligning with the stated intent of the law.   
  
If the incentives to act efficiently are in place then the actor has the incentive to discover the information necessary to carry out his task. But perfect information cannot fix poor incentives and, in fact, can make them worse. Rather than focusing on hiring statisticians, econometricians, and other technocrats to create ever-new metrics to judge government efficiency, Congress should think carefully about aligning incentives to get the outcomes they want. That is a near-impossible job for politicians to tackle so, in most cases, they should just pull back the reach of federal law enforcement to focus on a handful of tasks.   
  
_Conclusion_   
  
The best information in the world cannot compensate for poor incentives and can make government management less efficient by providing cover for any choice. Government agents are not usually malevolent, or at least any more so than the rest of us, but they have incentives to satisfy political demands. Private firms that behave in these ways often fail or earn lower profits unless they are bailed out by the government, which is usually the source of these poor incentives in the first place. More metrics can even worsen efficiency. We should look to deeper structural reforms of government agencies rather than continuing to appeal to a priesthood of statisticians and econometricians to produce information to guide us.

 **Things that we will never witness:** _An important message to my country from the Honourable Mr Underpants Bridges._



Just yesterday the Leader of the Communist Party of Aotearoa called me names, saying I was a ‘Denier’ and that I represent a threat to climate policy; and he’s right. I am!



I am a threat to the wealth-stealing, private property confiscation cabal that is the Reds and Greens of this fine land. I don’t need to remind you that Green is the colour that something Red turns when it’s utterly rotten, and they are putrid; they stink.



They stink because they pretend to be responsible and ethical yet truth is a complete stranger to them. Because if they wanted to tell the truth in the midst of this Oh-so-important climate ’emergency’, they would tell you wouldn’t they, what they fully intend it should cost you to remove a **one-twenty-fifth of one percent** , yes, that’s a 0.04% amount of a trace element, a plant food in fact, from the skies above New Zealand?



Why would they withhold this extremely important information from you? They’ve had it in their dirty, grubby, Green, stealing, sticky, stinking fingers for several weeks.



Because James Shaw is so mendacious and so gutless, he’s fully afraid to tell the public what he and his cohort of economic vandals have in mind for degrading your way of life. So the mantle has fallen to me. So here it is, from Treasury. Read it, and weep…New Zealand:



Look at those numbers; a hit to our economy of $215,900,000,000 by 2050 to remove carbon dioxide or, worse, to remove all ‘greenhouse’ gases. That is **247.5 Billion Dollars** over just 4 decades. This is madness, it’s almost economic treason. How many new hospitals, schools, cancer-medications, public transport initiatives, clean-water plants, noxious pest-removal programmes, does this bill leech off, sucking the very life from? How many jobs does it destroy?”



If the number is too big to comprehend (the big lie is easier to sell than the small lie, some propagandist once said), just look one column left of the big numbers to see what the narcissist-in-thief intends you should contribute, every single household in the country, every year, year-on-year, to 2050 and beyond. The “GNDI” (that’s **your Disposable Income** folks) under either scenario it’s very close to $18,000 every year, an extra **$370 per week** taken, milked, from every home in the country in levies, taxes, fees, increased costs and ‘climate contributions’; for what?



To assert the execrable, unethical and dishonest James Shaw’s moral superiority, to fulfil **his huge vanity project.** To make him look good to his mirror, and his comrades. How on earth are worse-off families going to cope, or those on fixed incomes? The man makes me utterly sick, green to the gills in fact.



 _Alas, meantime, in the real world:_

"When scientists from Imperial College released a simulation of a tsunami, triggered by a vast undersea landslide at Storrega off the coast of Norway around 6000 BC, it probably came as a surprise to many in north-west Europe that their reassuringly safe part of the world had been subject to such a cataclysmic event. The researchers suggest that this succession of destructive waves up to 14 metres high may have depopulated an area that is now in the middle of the North Sea, known as Doggerland. However, melting ice at the end of the last ice age around 18,000 years ago led to rising sea levels that inundated vast areas of continental shelves around the world. These landscapes, which had been home to populations of hunter gatherers for thousands of years were gradually overwhelmed by millions of tonnes of meltwater swelling the ocean. Doggerland, essentially an entire prehistoric European country, disappeared beneath the North Sea, its physical remains preserved beneath the marine silts but lost to memory. Although effectively untouched and largely untouchable, the existence of these landscapes had been appreciated since the 19th century. Their potential significance was such that the archaeologist Graham Clark, father of British Mesolithic studies, wrote in 1936 that: “It would be possible to take comfort from the fact that such cultures might not have existed, were it not eminently probable that they not only existed, but flourished, under conditions more favourable than those inland.” For more than 60 years after this the unreachable nature of Doggerland ensured that archaeologists knew very little about the settlement or even the people of these drowned lands. So little in fact, that it is probably correct to say that the only inhabited lands on Earth that remain to be significantly explored are those lost to the oceans. Indeed, Professor Geoff Bailey, at the University of York, recently suggested that across the world they represent one of “the last frontiers of geographical and archaeological exploration”. In the past decade, however, a phenomenal amount of work has begun to shed light on this inundated landscape. The increasing appreciation of the length of human occupation of north-west Europe, currently thought to stretch back around 900,000 years and understanding that for much of this time Britain was not an island, but a peninsular of Europe, has stimulated research.  A number of dramatic new archaeological finds have given us clues to the extent to which these drowned landscapes are preserved beneath the sea. These include a Neanderthal skull fragment from the Zeeland Ridges off the coast of the Netherlands and a collection of 75 Neanderthal stone tools and animal remains from off the coast of East Anglia, both dating to the Middle Palaeolithic – some 50,000 to 300,000 years ago. Another development relates to work by researchers at the University of Birmingham that uses seismic reflection data gathered by the offshore oil and gas industry at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Using this information, archaeologists have been able to map the surviving prehistoric landscapes beneath the North Sea silts. Hills, rivers, streams, estuaries, lakes and marshes can now be identified.  Recent projects supported by English Heritage, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and seismic survey company PGS have mapped a previously unseen Mesolithic country of more than 45,000km2, about the size of the Netherlands. Returning to the Storrega Tsunami, no doubt this was a truly catastrophic event and certainly a major event that played out toward the end of Doggerland’s history. But the truth was that Doggerland had been slowly submerging for thousands of years. The heartland of north-west Europe would have been constantly shrinking, in a way that would have been obvious to its inhabitants. Sometimes slowly and on occasions terrifyingly quickly, the sea inevitably reclaimed ancestral hunting grounds, campsites and landmarks.  Consequently, the final force driving research interest in Doggerland must be the inexorable effects of climate change. The loss of Doggerland was the last time modern humans experienced climate change at the scale currently projected by climate scientists. It can be appreciated that the prehistoric sea-level rise that resulted in the loss of these vast areas of land was caused by natural rather than anthropogenic factors. And also, that the extensive loss of such  land, while devastating to those that lived there, was never likely to amount to an extinction-level event.  The Mesolithic communities of the great plains of north-western Europe were flexible and mobile in the face of such change. Suffering there must have been, but they moved and adapted. Modern populations, however, do not necessarily have such a luxury in a world with far more people to share its finite resources and where the majority of the urban centres lie on coastlines. And because of that, the history of Doggerland, and other drowned lands, should rise above the status of historical curiosity to that of a record of a critical period in human history that we would be well advised to study."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"Greta Thunberg and a group of other children have pushed forward their legal complaint at the UN against countries they accuse of endangering children’s wellbeing through the climate crisis, despite attempts to have it thrown out. The 16 children, including the Swedish environmental activist, lodged a legal case with the UN committee on the rights of the child against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey last September. They alleged that the countries – which are legally obliged to protect children under the UN convention on the rights of the child – breached those obligations by failing to protect them from the “direct, imminent and foreseeable risk to their health and wellbeing” posed by the climate crisis. Three countries – Brazil, France and Germany – have replied to the petition, saying it should not be admissible by the committee. But on Tuesday the children hit back, arguing that the countries should be judged by their behaviour on the climate crisis. They said the three countries were all failing to cut their emissions in line with the Paris agreement. In response to the objections raised by Brazil, France and Germany, the children said they had been “directly and foreseeably injured” by the greenhouse gas emissions that those governments had allowed to change the climate. They have submitted new scientific research on how the countries are failing in their obligations, and said it would be “futile” to argue their case in separate domestic lawsuits in each country, as that “would not provide the type of far-reaching international relief needed to reverse climate change”. Although 140 countries, excluding the US, have ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child, only 46 governments have adopted a protocol that allows for this kind of legal action. Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey – are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld. There has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint. The lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the Netherlands, in the Urgenda case, in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis. In the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement. The ruling will have implications for other government plans likely to raise emissions, such as road-building schemes. More than 1,300 legal actions have been brought around the world to try to force governments to confront the climate crisis. More than 1,000 are in the US; the highest profile case there, the Juliana case, was dismissed by judges earlier this year. There are similar cases ongoing in 28 countries including Ireland, Australia, Spain and New Zealand."
"BP’s new chief executive said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has deepened his commitment to shrinking the oil giant’s carbon footprint to zero. Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil firm in February, said he was “more convinced than ever” that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets. He told the Guardian that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is “deeper” due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. “I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it,” he said. “The pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term.” Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends. This raises serious questions over the business models of major oil companies, which are already under pressure due to tougher climate action and the rise of renewable energy. “We’re all living and working differently right now. Not all of that will stick, but some of it will stick for sure. The question I have is whether consumers will consume less, and I think there is a possibility that they will,” Looney said. The world’s oil demand has fallen to 25-year lows following the outbreak of Covid-19, which has severely limited demand for transport fuels, causing global oil prices to fall by two-thirds. The oil market crisis has wiped billions from major oil companies, including BP which reported a loss for the first quarter of this year. “I think this will remind people of the fragility of the ecosystem that we work in; people are looking up at the skies and seeing less pollution, and I do hope that there will be an even greater appreciation for nature as we move forward, which should keep the climate at the forefront of public debate,” he added. Looney began his tenure as BP boss by promising that the oil company would invest more in clean energy and less in fossil fuels over the next three decades as part of an ambition to become a carbon neutral business by 2050. The plan will use carbon offsets, such as tree-planting and emissions capture technology, to mitigate the fossil fuels it will continue to produce by the middle of the century. “Do the near-term issues cause us to be able to invest a little less than I would have liked in these next couple of years? Possibly,” he said. “But I do believe that we will remain true to what we said on 12 February; that over time, we will invest more into non-carbon businesses and less into hydrocarbon businesses.” The pressure facing oil producers has increased as investors begin to turn their backs on fossil fuels in favour of green energy, which is cheaper and offers more predictable returns. This year, US oil prices plunged below zero for the first time, while BP’s solar energy business, Lightsource, struck new US solar power contracts totaling 400MW, Looney said, which underlines the resilience of the business. “This is a sector which continues to attract investment and I think that’s because it is what society wants,” Looney said. “These are the reasons why my commitment [to net zero] remains as deep, if not deeper than it has been.”"

The True Story About Who Destroyed a Genetically Modified Rice Crop
 By Mark Lynas
Did you hear that a group of 400 angry farmers attacked and destroyed a field trial of genetically modified rice in the Philippines this month? That, it turns out, was a lie. The crop was actually destroyed by a small number of activists while farmers who had been bussed in to attend the event looked on in dismay.
The nature of the attack was widely misreported, from the New York Times to New Scientist to BBC News, based on false claims by the activists. But then anti-GMO activists often lie. In support of the vandals, Greenpeace has claimed that there are health concerns about the genetically modified rice. In fact there is no evidence of risk, and the destruction of this field trial could lead to needless deaths.
The rice is genetically enhanced to produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene, giving it a golden color. …
Andrew Revkin on Greenpeace role in fighting Golden Rice:
I’ve been a fan of Greenpeace’s creative, but legal, work to press big companies over destructive forest practices. I called it “activism at its best” last year. But the group’s distorted and incendiary rhetoric on this issue, mashing up anti-corporate emotion with baseless or distorted arguments about this rice strain, is activism at its worst.” …

Climate alarmists have intentionally targeted children – to push their political objectives. Instead of holding an honest debate with adults, they have chosen to terrorize young people with their lies and propaganda. They are destroying science while simultaneously destroying the mental health of children.

"Former senior public servants have called for the re-introduction of a carbon price, saying it would be the least economically damaging way to cut greenhouse gas emissions and could deliver the technological solutions the Morrison government says are needed. In interviews on ABC TV’s Four Corners on Monday, several ex-top advisors expressed frustration and in some cases anger about the country’s failure to introduce durable policies to address climate change.  Ken Henry, the Treasury secretary between 2001 and 2011, said the question the government should be asking itself on climate was how to put a cap, or limit, on national emissions at least cost to the country. “The answer to that question – and everybody will tell this – is an emissions trading scheme,” he said. Martin Parkinson, a former secretary of Treasury and the now defunct climate change department, said it was incorrect to categorise carbon pricing as being “about taxing people”. “The carbon price is actually about creating the right sort of incentives to develop the technology and then use it,” he said. On national climate policy, Parkinson said: “What climate policy? I mean it’s basically … it’s a mess. It’s incoherent and has been for a decade.” Peter Shergold, the head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in the final years of the Howard government, was asked what he would say to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, if he held that position now. He said he would tell him: “My sense, prime minister, is that there is a mood to follow such leadership if it exists. Tell it honestly, and tell it truthfully, and don’t try and pretend there are not going to be costs imposed on industry and costs imposed on individuals, but it is worth that for the sake of your children and your grandchildren.” The former bureaucrats made the comments while reflecting on the bipartisan support for carbon pricing between 2007 and 2009. Their shared position is consistent with advice given to governments since before that period. The Morrison government has rejected calls for fossil fuel industries to have to pay for their emissions. Its central climate policy, the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, uses taxpayer money to pay some businesses and landowners to limit carbon pollution, often by restoring and protecting native habitat. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, told Four Corners the answer to reducing emissions was to use incentives and focus on “technology, not taxes”. The government has promised a “technology investment roadmap” this year. “Ultimately, reductions in emissions will happen when technologies that work, that are at parity with their higher-emitting alternatives, where rational people choose them because they’re good choices,” Taylor said. “That’s how we’ll bring down emissions globally, and Australia is absolutely committed not just to using those technologies within Australia, but playing a role in areas like hydrogen, integration of household solar, land management, to help other countries to reduce their emissions in that longer term timeframe as well.” Henry said the past decade of climate politics had left him in no doubt that “we have failed”. “I look back on it now and I still feel gutted,” he said. “I feel angry. I know that’s not a good thing, and I probably should get therapy, but I’ve asked myself this question many, many times: why do I still feel angry about it? And the reason I feel angry about it is that I feel angry about what Australia has lost.” There is a growing push internationally for governments and business to back a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 120 countries and Australia’s six states have set a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Morrison government has not set this target, and has emphasised that gas, a fossil fuel, will be central to its economic recovery plans. It has also promised a long-term emissions strategy this year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was commissioned at the 2015 Paris climate summit to report on what would be involved in limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. It found it was likely it could be achieved by cutting global emissions 45% between 2010 and 2030 and reaching net zero by about 2050. Until this year, Australia’s emissions had largely flatlined since 2014, when the Coalition repealed the emissions trading scheme introduced by Labor with the support of the Greens and independents. Though often mis-described as a carbon tax, it was designed to become a trading scheme after three initial years of a fixed carbon price imposed on emitting businesses. Both Australian and global emissions have fallen this year due to the economic shutdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, but analysts say they are expected to rebound unless recovery plans incorporate policies to address climate change."

To: Dr. Roger Wakimoto



Director, National Center for Atmospheric Research



Boulder, Colorado



Roger, you are the head of what is perhaps the most prestigious atmospheric science laboratory on the planet, and, as such, I presume that you will always go the extra mile to protect the reputation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and its related University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).



I’m sure you have seen and discussed with your staff many of the “Climategate” emails released first in November, 2009, and then more recently, earlier this month.



Everyone agrees that the tone and content of many of them is a bit shrill and occasionally intolerant (kind of like University faculty meetings), but there is one repeating thread, by one of your most prestigious employees, Dr. Tom Wigley, that is far beyond the pale of most academic backbiting.



The revoking of my doctorate, the clear objective of Tom’s email, is the professional equivalent of the death penalty. I think it needs to be brought to your attention, because the basic premise underlying his machinations is patently and completely false. Dr Wigley is known as a careful scientist, but he certainly was careless here.



The global circulation of this email has caused unknown damage to my reputation. Also, please note that all communications from Dr. Wigley to his colleagues on this matter were on the NCAR/UCAR server.



The relevant email was sent to Rick Piltz, a UCAR employee at the time, and copied to Michael Mann, Pennsylvania State University, James Hansen and Gavin Schmidt, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Benjamin Santer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,the late Steven Schneider, Stanford University, and several other very prominent climate scientists. The influence of these individuals is manifest and evidence of a very serious attempt to destroy my credential.



What Dr. Wigley wrote to this group of individuals was:



“You may be interesting [sic] in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?”



As I said, revoking the doctorate of a scientist is the equivalent of imposing a professional death penalty. Unfortunately, Wigley’s rationale for organizing this effort was based upon a pure fabrication.



Wigley’s call for a “re‐​assessing” of my dissertation stems from his contention that I either misled my academic committee or my committee was guilty of professional malfeasance, both very serious charges. (His email is reproduced in its entirety at the end of this note.)



My 1979 dissertation was a model relating interannual and interseasonal variations in the shape of the atmosphere, as reflected by the surface barometric pressure field, to variations crop yields across the United States.



In this type of model, one usually factors out the technological component of crop yields (which, incidentally, explains much more variation than any climate component) and then models the remaining variation in yield with the climate factor, in order to “isolate” the climate component. The explained variance of this residual yield by climate is generally about 50%, which is very close to the average I found for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat.



Wigley said in his email that I claimed to have explained 95% of the variation in crop yield, which he said “would have been a remarkable results” [sic]. In fact, there is no such statement, nor anything related to that, in my dissertation. He went on to state that I did this by simultaneously modelling the technological, spatial and climate components of agricultural yield, instead of separating out technological components first.



Despite his claimed familiarity with my dissertation, I did no such thing. Table 2, beginning on page 154 of the dissertation, is labelled “DETRENDING FUNCTIONS”, and gives the equations that were used to remove the technological component. All subsequent analyses were on the detrended data.



Wigley then alleged that either I lied to my examination committee, or that they were buffoons. It is worth noting that the committee included the famously tough Reid Bryson, father of the modern notion that human beings could change the climate.



“Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.”



This came to my attention with the release of the first East Anglia emails in November, 2009. This email and other, new statements by him about my dissertation have surfaced with the recent release of additional emails, and his letter about my dissertation is again being circulated around the web.



I think you will agree that it is time for Dr. Wigley to state that his attempt to generate a movement to remove my doctorate was based upon clear errors on his part, errors that he should have known about, and yet he has let the record stand for over two years. What he “discovered years ago” was certainly not in my dissertation.



Roger, I don’t think you would put up with this, and I think Wigley must be compelled to come forth. Remember that he did this on NCAR’s (and the taxpayer’s) dime.



Thank you very much.

Cc: [E-MAILS REDACTED]



Dear folks,



You may be interesting in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?



Michaels’ PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt with statistical (regression‐​based) modeling of crop‐​climate relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical model showed that weather/​climate variations could explain 95% of the inter‐​annual variability in crop yields. Had this been correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it was at odds with all previous studies of crop‐​climate relationships, which generally showed that weather/​climate could only explain about 50% of inter‐​annual yield variability.



How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels’ regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability, so that, in Michaels’ regressions, weather/​climate explains just 5 of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels’ claim that weather/​climate explains 95% of the variability is completely bogus.



Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.



As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop‐​climate modeling. We used a spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.



Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983: Crop‐​climate modelling using spatial patterns of yield and climate: Part 1, Background and an example from Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.



There never was a “Part 2.”

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
Traditionally _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress. This is an exception, in response to a massive pre‐​peer‐​review public relations campaign currently in progress from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) science team.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





On October 21, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) research team sent four manuscripts on surface temperature histories to the peer‐​reviewed journal _Journal of Geophysical Research_ (JGR). The same day, they issued a press release detailing the research findings contained in those manuscripts.



The most prestigious journals, such as _Science_ and _Nature_ , automatically reject any submission if the results are made public prior to their publication. Other journals can be (but aren’t necessarily) a bit more lax. But the sheer scope of the BEST pre‐​peer‐​review PR campaign has been very impressive.



The original BEST press release confidently stated that their findings would be incorporated the next comprehensive report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which presumes that they will be accepted for publication largely in their current form.



For several reasons, I think this is highly presumptuous.



Consider their paper on urban heat islands (UHI), the well‐​known warming of towns and cities compared to the surrounding countryside. UHIs can be very impressive. Washington DC and Tokyo’s are both in excess of 2°C (3.6°F) for average temperature, but the effect can be much greater — as much as 12°C (21.6°F) on clear, calm nights in the winter.



They are also ubiquitous, having been found systematically at locations in the U.S. with populations of only 1200. And they are _positive_ , meaning that they are in the warm direction. (There are negative UHIs in China, probably a result of extreme urban air pollution that significantly reduces incident sunlight, compared to the countryside.)



At any rate, BEST found a global urban _cooling_ effect, counter to virtually every other study in science history.



Now, this may turn out to be correct and every prior study may have been wrong. But that’s doubtful. It is a given that bricks and pavement heat up much more than vegetated ground during the day, and that the roughness of the city impedes the flow of ventilating winds, resulting in warmer nights.



I suspect that the official peer‐​reviewers are going to relentlessly home in on this result, and I doubt that anyone would recommend publication of the paper without extensive documentation and without the statements, contained in the submitted manuscript, about “urban cooling” and “rural warming”. Consequently, the flat‐​out statement that their manuscripts will be accepted seems a bit overconfident.



 **Where’s the “Pause”?**



In their extensive and well‐​orchestrated press offensive, BEST’s director Richard Muller made it quite clear on the BBC that they had not found the “pause” in global warming that begins in the late 1990s in other analyses. Is that really true?







In response to Muller’s statement, David Whitehouse, from the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the United Kingdom, excerpted the BEST team’s monthly temperature departures from average for the last ten years. The result certainly looks like the familiar “pause.” However, there is an obviously bad data point in early 2010 (which is noted on the BEST website).



The response of the green blogs (and the _Washington Post_ ) to Whitehouse was that indeed there was a warming — of 0.14°C, if one removed the last two points.



In reality, while that is true, because of the inherent noise in BEST’s land‐​only data, that “trend” does not come close to statistical significance, which means that _it cannot be distinguished from zero_ , or no trend.



(This is a common problem in climate rhetoric, and even the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change and the U.S. National Climatic Data Center often make the egregious error of stating “trends” that in fact are no different than zero.)







Note that Whitehouse’s analysis begins in January 2001. In reality, the divergence between the BEST and the rest largely occurs in the late 1990s.



1998 saw one of the largest El Niño events ever measured. These are periodic warmings of the tropical Pacific Ocean that occur when, for reasons currently unknown, easterly trade winds slow or even reverse. When this happens, a normal upwelling of cold water off of South America is suppressed, and the global average temperature suddenly jumps.



When the trades return, the suppressed cold water comes to the surface with a vengeance, and global temperatures drop for a year or so far below where they peaked from the El Niño. This “reverse phase” is called La Niña — something we will visit again later in this _Wisdom_.



The key words here are _Pacific Ocean_. The BEST analysis is for land temperatures only (which also does not include islands). Consequently the extreme warmth of 1998 (and the following cold La Niña) does not appear as it does in the global (land and ocean) records. This is why there’s no spike in the 1998 data in the chart shown above. On the other hand, it is quite obvious in the land‐​ocean record:







When fishing for global climate fish, use global data.



Which of the three _global_ records is most reliable during the “pause?” That can be determined by comparison to the completely independent record of temperatures measured by satellites. It turns out that the East Anglia record most accurately captures the 1998 El Niño, and therefore it is the one that should be examined in depth for recent behavior.



 **How Long Have We Gone Without Warming?**



The correspondence between the East Anglia thermometer record and the satellite record, which measures microwave radiation from the lower atmosphere, is reassuring. It is noteworthy that there are two versions of the satellite data, one from the University of Alabama‐​Huntsville, where it was first developed, and another from Remote Sensing Systems, a California consultancy that processes the data in a slightly different fashion.



Monthly versions of the three records (the East Anglia history and the two versions of the satellite) are pretty close together in how long they say the current lack of warming has gone on. This can be determined by passing trends through records of increasing length and finding when a statistically significant warming emerges. Using this method, there is no significant warming in the last 15.0 years in the CRU thermometer record, 13.9 years in the Alabama version of the satellite data, and 15.6 years in the California analysis.



 **How Long Will We Go Without Warming?**



Obviously, no one really knows. But let’s start with the observation that the current era of steady temperatures, according to the figures above, began around 1996.



We are currently experiencing another — for now — moderate La Niña, or the cold phase of El Niño. Satellite temperatures, as of this writing, have dropped below where they were in the previous La Niña of 2008, so 2011 isn’t going to be particularly warm compared to the average of the last 15 years.



In addition, the latest forecast from the Department of Commerce’s Climate Prediction Center is for the current La Niña to become stronger and persist through at least the first half of 2012:







Consequently, 2012, like 2011, is not likely to be particularly warm when compared to the last 15 years.



Assume that, beginning in 2013, surface temperatures rise at the rate they did from the mid‐​1970s through the late 1990s. How much time would have to elapse before a statistically significant warming trend was established, post‐​1995?



Significance would finally be achieved in 2021. That would be after a 24‐​year stretch with no significant net warming.



So, in summary, BEST really does not tell us much that is new. It, too, contains the “pause,” but the big 1998 peak is missed because the study was only for land areas, while most of the 1998 warming was at the surface of the ocean due to the massive El Niño. Satelllite data, not used in the BEST science, tells us that the East Anglia climate record is probably most reliable for global estimates during the “pause.” La Niña conditions mean that 2011 and 2012 are not likely to be particularly warm. Even if surface temperatures begin to rise in 2013 at the rate that they rose from the mid 1970s to the late 1990s, a significant warming trend since 1995 will not be established until 2021.



It seems hard to believe that there will be much political will for expensive global warming policies after two‐​and‐​a‐​half decades without a significant rise in temperature.

As WUWT readers know, Andrew Revkin of the New York Times was the first to “authenticate” the stolen Heartland documents. Only one problem, one of the documents, the one that “gave the story legs” (in journo parlance) was a fake. That fake document, combined with Revkin’s “authentication” then helped release an avalanche of coverage, most of it without even checking with the sources first.  These newshounds adopted a pack mentality and went chasing the fox.
In a pushback to this lack of journalistic integrity, the Charles Koch Foundation has issued a strongly worded denunciation on their opinion the New York Times’ reporting of the Fakegate affair.
One might expect the Times to have some chagrin about its reporting that was based on material obtained by fraud, motivated by an ulterior ideological agenda, and suspect in its authenticity.  Yet even though that source lied, cheated, and stole – and refuses to answer any further question from the Times or anyone – reporter Andrew Revkin nonetheless found room to praise him, writing, “It’s enormously creditable that Peter Gleick has owned up to his terrible error in judgment.”  Readers would be right to wonder if the Times itself is able to own up to mistakes on this story.
I used to have more respect for Andrew Revkin than many other reporters, because he was much more open and accessible. But like Gleick, he’s really damaged himself in this episode. Now he’s just any other reporter with a cause. Speaking of damage… 
I’ve been damaged as well, with all sorts of false and malicious reports. The Guardian’s early coverage for example from Goldenberg and Hickman didn’t even wait for a response from me. though Goldenberg asked for comment, she didn’t wait for a response. The news organ of the British government, BBC’s Richard Black, also didn’t seek comment. He just published his opinion. And so it went with serial regurgitators worldwide.
Locally, one such person who has been leading the libeling of me is familiar to many readers here from his hilariously inept interactions in blog comments. That’s Dr. Mark Stemen, of Chico State University. On his Facebook page he labeled me as a “Koch-whore” (I have screencaps which I’ll share later) without so much as asking me a question first. And, in an email to me he went from simple libel to malicious libel by saying “and I’ve made sure everyone knows it”.
It didn’t matter to him that Koch wasn’t even involved with climate funding to Heartland when I pointed it out, he just took another tack of denigration. The hate from this man and his students he’s telling about me on his Facebook page is palpable. Problem is, he’s been using publicly funded resources to push his political activism, something we’ve seen time and again in Climategate.
Of course Dr. Stemen is part of CSUC’s sustainability cabal committee with the City of Chico, who uses his publicly funded bully pulpit to dictate to our town what others should do in living our lives in the green meme. When you are given such godlike power (conveyed with tenure without consequences) over others, I suppose there’s no need to check facts first. Slime first, ask questions later.
The irrational hatred spewing from Dr. Mark Stemen and others over the word “Koch” in any context belies serious shortcomings in being factual and rational messengers in education, a role he was hired to do.
Here’s the Koch letter to NYT:

Charles Koch Foundation Confronts the New York Times for Misleading Readers

The following letter was sent by Tonya Mullins of the Charles Koch Foundation to Art Brisbane, Public Editor, at the New York Times on February 24, 2012:
Dear Mr. Brisbane:
In previous correspondence with Melissa Cohlmia of Koch Industries, you invited any further examples of flawed journalism on the news side. The Times’s recent piece on the Charles Koch Foundation [Leak Offers Glimpse of Campaign Against Climate Science; 2/15/12] is one of the more egregious examples to date.  Here are our specific concerns:

As soon as we read the piece, we pointed out to editors that they had been misinformed.  The article stated, “The documents say that the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation…was expected to contribute $200,000 this year [to Heartland Institute].”  That is demonstrably false and we said so in writing and on the record in an email.  But editor Nancy Kenney replied a day later to ask if we could be “more explicit” (correspondence attached below).  A public statement from the Charles Koch Foundation had been out for days at that point and the authenticity of the document the Times relied on had been disavowed by Heartland and thoroughly discredited by other news outlets.  Yet, the Times would not update or clarify the story to include these facts.
The Times never reached out to us before publication, despite quoting several other parties that were cited. Ms. Kenney claims to “regret that our reporters didn’t call you” and yet when we asked her for an explanation (twice) she ignored the question and the information we provided remains withheld from readers.
The piece tried to convey that the Charles Koch Foundation had funded Heartland’s work on climate science – based on the headline, lede, and the sentences immediately preceding and after the mention of the Foundation’s donation, all of which emphasize climate science.  That is false, and we explained to Ms. Kenney that our $25,000 donation was specifically for healthcare research.  Ms. Kenney insists that we are “misreading” the article and that it is somehow “clear from the overall context” that the donation was for “purposes other than climate advocacy.”  Her position is puzzling in light of the actual content and context, yet when we asked for explanation she gave none.

Since the piece ran, it has come to light that some of the documents the Times cited were obtained by an activist who, by his own admission, perpetrated a fraud on Heartland.  One of the documents, a purported cover memo, is now widely regarded as wholly fabricated – a view supported by what both we and Heartland have separately told the paper.
However, the paper’s subsequent reporting still omits any mention of our direct and salient statements to the Times about that apparent fabrication.  Readers are still left with the false impression about the size, duration, and intent of our donation.  Our good faith questions about why the Times failed to call us and won’t include our viewpoint remain unanswered.  Not one of the five Times reporters that have written on the topic – Leslie Kaufman, Justin Gillis, John Border, Felicity Barringer, and Andrew Revkin – even attempted to contact us for input or reaction.
One might expect the Times to have some chagrin about its reporting that was based on material obtained by fraud, motivated by an ulterior ideological agenda, and suspect in its authenticity.  Yet even though that source lied, cheated, and stole – and refuses to answer any further question from the Times or anyone – reporter Andrew Revkin nonetheless found room to praise him, writing, “It’s enormously creditable that Peter Gleick has owned up to his terrible error in judgment.”  Readers would be right to wonder if the Times itself is able to own up to mistakes on this story.
If you could look into this matter we would appreciate your feedback.
Sincerely,
Tonya Mullins
Director of Communications
Charles Koch Foundation

 **Albert-Eden Local Board (Owairaka subdivision)**



 **Albert-Eden Local Board**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.  




I note that the candidate profiles on [voteauckland.co.nz](http://voteauckland.co.nz/) now have some questions included:



In the interests of fairness, I’ll be linking each candidate profile to their name and affiliation.



 **Owairaka Subdivision**



There are 10 candidates for this 4 seat subdivision of the Albert-Eden Local Board. You may cast up to 4 votes in this FPP contest



[ **Megan Earley –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=922262fa-9c0a-46e5-b01d-4449129edcb7&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))Independent **$$$$**  




To me, Megan represents the best of those who seek to represent their community on the Local Board. From what I can tell, this is her first attempt at standing for election, she isn’t affiliated to a ticket, isn’t a professional politician and has the sort of background that screams ‘doing this for the right reasons!’



Aside from being a school teacher, she is also a volunteer, sports coach and manager and committee and board member (presumably for a local softball club). Club Administrator of the Year in 2009, followed up by Volunteer of the Year this year. 



All her reasons for standing, what she loves about Owairaka and her priorities should she be elected come down to one thing: mucking in with other community volunteers to make her neighbourhood a better place to live.



Brilliant!



[ **Graeme Easte –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=c745b5ac-7752-4ab4-90d8-eb7ef168600f&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision **$**



“A community activist for many years…” reeks of left-wing busybody. Easte is the founder of the Campaign for Better Transport, trying to make our streets safer through ‘traffic calming’. A term I’ve never seen before, conjuring up images of a wizard blowing copious amounts of marijuana smoke at traffic lights or blasting mindfulness tunes to drift you to sleep while angels push your car in neutral (I might have stolen that from The Simpsons).



[This 16 page report from NZTA](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/userfiles/transport-data/Traffic%20Calming.pdf) reveals it is actually all those annoying bloody obstacles sprayed across the street to make driving less fun. After reading the first page crowing the benefits of 20 mph zones in London, vertical features, horizontal features and zonal treatments, I needed pharmaceutical calming.



He appears to endorse the city intensifying and ‘growing up’ rather than sprawling and is very concerned about pressure on facilities, infrastructure and threats to “their very character”.



Well, what is it East with an E? You can’t have everything your own way. Preserving character while intensifying through regulatory extremism is nonsense. There will be no intensification in YOUR neighbourhood but land prices will skyrocket as nosy noddies use every possible legal tool they have to make your neighbours’ lives miserable.



What’s more, he’s concerned that local shopping centres (ie, street corner collections of small businesses) are facing strong competition from the new mall in Newmarket and expansion of St Lukes. He proposes flinging your rate money into subsidising these businesses in a hopeless battle against the malls. They’re large, they’re profitable, they’re clearly where most of us want to shop.



Finally, because we are becoming short on open space, he proposes slicing Chamberlain Golf Course in half. Generally speaking, I’m pro-privatisation but this shortage of open space is Easte’s ideological creation. Abolish the urban boundary and then reduce the pressure on limited open spaces within it!



Finally, he wants to expand his traffic calming hoo-hah while curbing climate change. How are you going to achieve that with slowed, congested traffic idling at your zonal treatments?

Local businessman, Chair of the local neighbourhood association and a cycling coach at Diocesan (wait, hear me out!).



 _“Running a local business, I understand how poor decision-making and communication by Council, Albert-Eden Local Board and Auckland Transport causes real-world chaos, costs and delays.”_



Unlike some zonally treated twats who’ve spent decades table-thumping inside freezing historic micro-councils, Jose lives in the real world and he’s tired of City Vision’s shit.



Fowler is offering safer neighbourhoods, better community consultation (maybe not the best idea in a City Vision dominated subdivision) and cutting wasteful spending.



Good. More of that!

Just when my blood pressure was about to return to normal, I have to review another City Vision candidate.



 _My vision is for a safer community that is caring and inclusive. I will support local business success and sustainability._



 _I will fight to protect our heritage and ensure well-designed development for our growing population. I stand for protecting nature, a cleaner environment and climate action. I want to help everyone reduce environmental harm, with improved recycling and transport choices._



Uh oh.



 _I’m a new candidate, standing to fight for Owairaka’s communities and natural environment. I want Owairaka to be a great place to live in 10 and 20 years’ time, and for future generations, even with increasingly intensive development and extreme weather events._



Please, no.  




 _I think that Local Board decision-making is important because it affects everything we come into contact with as soon as we leave our homes – the air that we breathe, the water we rely on and how we get around. I want to help the Local Board fully flex its muscle (sic) and support communities’ responses to the **climate change emergency,** both by reducing carbon emissions and adapting to survive predicted extreme weather events and sea level rise._



Oh, fuck off! I’m sorry. I know that language brings down the standard of this voting guide even further. But this is a serious candidate standing for a serious citywide political ticket offering the biggest bucket of crap I’ve come across. We’re only up to the second ward!



 _If I’m elected, I will use my “ **climate emergency glasses”**_



Ladies and gentlemen, your low voter turnout.  




[ **Anthony McGivern –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=fb12f4a5-ac28-4e93-8094-c43a9cb6f431&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))C&R – Communities and Residents **$$$$**



McGivern reckons the current Local Board is not working for Owairaka. If the current Local Board just stopped working completely, they would triple their effectiveness.



Anthony has a commercial background in infrastructure and strategic leadership across private and public sectors. If I were elected to this Local Board, I’d show up 5 minutes early and lock the doors. Looks like Anthony is probably better qualified for the position.



He supports several charities and coaches school orienteering. It sounds like nerds going outside but maybe I’m just a little grumpy after reading that Maskill idiot’s profile.



Anthony looks like he’s had his profile written for him because it also mentions cutting wasteful spending and prioritising outcomes communities want. That’s fine by me.



[ **Monique Poirier – C &R – **](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a3a1ab84-ce69-4275-98cd-cc076381206e&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))Communities and Residents **$$$**



I’m a little worried by Monique. She has a Master’s degree in political studies and easily looks young enough to have completed that under the Post-Modernist Social Justice regime which pervades the humanities departments in universities now.



However she is a business owner, has had enough of the council and wants to cut wasteful spending. I’d have thought a Master’s degree in political studies was wasteful spending but at least that’s her own money.



I’m sure Monique would be a great improvement on the existing four City Vision incumbents.



[ **Christina Robertson –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5b944919-65b1-4fd4-80db-0b6bc0531d24&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision ****



Maybe it’s a Freudian trick of the light, but at least one of Christina’s lenses appears to be rose coloured.



Christina needs to understand that less is more when it comes to pitching for people’s votes. Eleven paragraphs of sparkles, lollipops and psilocybin poetry splattered with quad-syllabled enviro-nut, calligraphic interpretative dance ain’t gonna cut it with me.



[ **Victoria Tupou –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=8f17f86b-4a82-4386-92f5-b30e3c5a3be9&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))Independent **$**



Victoria has a cat. I like cats. Spaced out City Vision candidates probably don’t. I like Victoria.



She does claim to be experienced in community building. I’m not sure what that means. Is she going to knock on my door with a cake or knock down the fence dividing our properties?



Further reading of her profile reveals a lot of communitarian themed words indicating she is going to keep everyone happy. I’ve changed my mind.



By the way, cats lie on you because you’re a source of heat.



[ **Kristina Walkley –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5ed66990-8ab7-41d2-9058-d91a834475ac&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\)) C&R – Communities and Residents **$$$**



Walkley is Head Teacher at a Pt Chev community kindergarten. That’s plenty of real world experience right there. Point Chevalier has an assortment of socio-economic demographics so when Kristina says she knows how hard families have to work to provide for their children, I believe her.



Her profile isn’t too different from the other C&R candidates, though it doesn’t mention anything about wasteful spending. Maybe she’s the mild-lefty of the bunch?



[ **Margi Watson –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=02901c2e-bf9e-4ab8-a361-9552103846db&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision **$$$$**



Margi is the only City Vision candidate that has gone to the effort of putting statistics and facts into her profile. That deserves some respect and also explains why she was the highest polling candidate of both subdivisions of the Albert-Eden Local Board in 2016 with 7292 votes. 



How the hell Peter Haynes, with 5142 votes, the lowest of all the successful candidates, became Chairman of the Local Board is absolutely baffling. He must have some serious dirt on his colleagues.



Margi claims that following the opening of the SH20 Waterview project, she fought for and secured $64 million of benefits for the surrounding communities. Now I understand if you think she’s overplaying her hand, being just one of eight Local Board members. However, Local Board’s aren’t known for being crammed with insanely dedicated workaholics, speed-reading volumes of reports til midnight before waking at 4am for tai-chi and motivational podcasts. Maybe she did do it single-handedly.



She appears to have an eye for detail, an impressive knowledge of the area and her job and hasn’t mentioned “climate emergency” once. 



Oh, “climate change action” is right down the bottom. Probably for tokenism’s sake.

Simon Bridges has been the subject of a lot of attention from the government, and most of it has been particularly disrespectful. While I am of the opinion that any publicity is good for Simon’s profile, there is definitely a real nastiness to it. From the Greens’ nasty attack video mocking his accent, to the Maori Council now demanding an apology for him calling Jacinda a part-time prime minister, to the great Oscar Kightley saying he was especially disrespectful to a hard-working prime minister (haha), Simon is being attacked from all sides. Yes, there is the view that he must be gaining some traction if he is being hit by the left all the time, but unfortunately, there is probably more to it than that.



The Green Party has been quick [to apologise](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/395035/greens-apologise-for-simon-bridges-attack-ad) and delete their attack advertisement mocking National leader Simon Bridges, not only for his environmental policies, but also for his accent. But what led the party to make such an ad in the first place? The ad is an example of the global phenomenon of “sneer politics”, in which it’s fashionable for liberal elites to admonish and ridicule the ordinariness and ‘uncouth’ elements of political opponents. 



I find it particularly ironic that the Greens think that they can sneer at others when Marama’s biggest claim to fame at the moment is reclaiming the ‘C’ word. That is about as uncouth as it gets… but it is always okay if the left does it.



It’s very fashionable in metropolitan and liberal circles to sneer at political leaders considered to be déclassé. The likes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are ridiculed not just for their reactionary politics, but also for their rather vulgar or even “common” styles and personalities. We call them “clowns”. 



Boris Johnson, Eton and Oxford scholar (former president of the Oxford Union) and Donald Trump, billionaire, would not fall into the category of people that we would normally consider uncouth. Johnson deliberately cultivates his bumbling persona. Alexander Boris Johnson is no clown.



Everywhere, such sneering has helped to widen the gap between liberal elites and the masses who feel belittled and patronised. In Britain, where Brexit voters have been painted as reactionaries and ignorant, the polarisation has simply become further entrenched. 



New Zealand has its own version of this arrogance, and it’s often seen on the left of politics, especially in more affluent and educated circles. The Greens have come to epitomise this phenomenon as a liberal and middle-class party.  
It’s no surprise that the party thought it was very smart to produce a video mocking Simon Bridges – not only for his allegedly backward views on climate change – but for his broad accent. And it was apt that the video was made for Twitter – a platform well known for its liberal sneering political discourse.  
Of course, the video actually fell flat and even Green Party supporters thought it went too far, leading to it being deleted and Green leaders giving some half-hearted apologies. 



  
But even last weekend, in the midst of the Green Party conference, James Shaw continued the sneering, with his comment stating “I would never empower someone with as little personal integrity as Simon Bridges to become Prime Minister”. That is yet another particularly nasty attack on an elected member of the house, by a Green Party MP who has never been elected, but sees himself as vastly superior to Bridges because he believes in the great climate change myth.



As did the Democrats in the USA in 2016… as do Labour in the UK towards those who voted for Brexit.



It isn’t just the Greens though. The attack on Simon Bridges might be the worst example so far, but don’t forget the sneering mantra “Nine years of neglect” to a government that had to deal with the GFC, two Christchurch earthquakes and then the Kaikoura earthquake in their time in government. You could forgive them if a few things did get overlooked, but they did far better than this government so far, with their ability to only talk about doing things rather than actually do them. Don’t forget David Parker’s comment to Judith Collins about her ‘sleeping in a crypt’ either. Labour can sneer just as well as the rest of them.



The thing is that sneering doesn’t work. Seeing themselves as having the moral high ground will probably cost the Greens some of their support. After all, you only have to think of Hilary Clinton’s ‘deplorables’ comment to realise how sneering can alienate voters. Some of those ‘deplorables’ might have been considering voting for Hilary until she showed her true colours. The moral high ground can be a lonely place, as so many liberal elites are now finding out.



Let’s just hope that the Greens find that out too, next year.

"**Nicola Sturgeon has defended her government's handling of the pandemic as statistics show Scotland's Covid death rate rose higher than England's in recent weeks.**
Figures show there were 50.5 deaths per million in Scotland in the week to 15 November, compared to 40.6 in England.
The first minister said it was too soon to be comparing statistics while ""still in the teeth of a pandemic"".
She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the death toll was unacceptable.
""I have done everything and will continue to do everything I can to try and control the virus to try and keep it as low as possible, to take the tough decisions that have to be taken in order to achieve that and to try to take people of Scotland along in these difficult steps with me as far as I possibly can,"" she said.
""But nobody underestimates the pain, the grief, the suffering that this global pandemic has brought to us.""
While the weekly statistics show that Scotland's death rate has been above England's in the last four weeks, Scotland's overall death rate is lower than England and Wales.
UK government statistics show that Scotland's Covid death rate is 94 per 100,000, compared to England's at 101.5 and Wales at 102.4. Northern Ireland's death rate is 63.4 per 100,000.
The interview came after the SNP leader told her party's virtual conference on Saturday that she had ""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent.
On Sunday the conference backed a plan to pressure the UK government into holding another referendum on the issue - and to explore alternative legal routes if it refuses.
Douglas Ross, the leader of Scottish Conservatives, said the SNP's record was ""clear for all to see"" but Ms Sturgeon's priority was ""dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum"".
Scotland's death toll surpassed 5,000 earlier this month and the latest National Records of Scotland figures now show 5,380 people have died with the virus in Scotland.
The statistics agency records the number of death certificates that mention the virus.
In England, using the same measure, more than 57,000 people have died with the virus.
Challenged on the death rate in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said that, over the course of the whole pandemic, it has been ""quite significantly lower"" than England and Wales, though it was higher than that of Northern Ireland.
""But across the whole of the UK, across much of Europe, far more people have died from this virus than any of us feel comfortable with,"" she added.
The SNP leader was also asked about care home deaths after a University of Stirling report found that 47% of Scotland's Covid deaths in the first wave were in care homes, compared to 30% in England.
""If you look at excess deaths overall in care homes across the UK, excess deaths in Scotland have actually been lower than in England but a higher proportion of these excess deaths have been attributed to Covid,"" she said.
""So in England more of the excess deaths have been attributed to other things, and certainly not to Covid. That simplistic view that the care home death toll is worse in Scotland perhaps doesn't bear that scrutiny.
""The death toll is unacceptable in Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and across much of Europe.""
The Scottish government has introduced five levels of restrictions in a bid to suppress the spread of the virus during the second wave.
People in 11 local authorities are currently living under the strictest limits of level four, with restrictions on travel, hospitality and non-essential shopping.
Later a Scottish government spokesman said weekly statistics did not accurately portray trends across the whole pandemic and ""can be misleading if looked at in isolation"".
""Deaths from Covid-19 in Scotland have been significantly lower over the course of the pandemic than England and Wales, with over 7% few deaths per 100,000 than England.""
Reacting to the interview, the Scottish Conservatives' Douglas Ross said the SNP's record was ""clear to see"".
""Scandalous number of care home deaths, education tumbling down the international league tables and withholding vital advice from the Salmond inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon's priority? Dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum,"" he said on Twitter.
Meanwhile Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrat, said Ms Sturgeon was ""good at presentation but has repeatedly fallen short on delivery.""
He said she ""talks a good game"" but she ""did not use the summer well to to prepare for the second wave of the virus in the autumn"".
Labour MP Ian Murray said Ms Sturgeon should be held to account for her ""failings in office"".
""Amid a child poverty crisis, care homes scandal and utter contempt for Holyrood, the first minister's record is one of broken promises to the people of Scotland,"" he added.
""Her only priority is to divide Scotland at a time when we need to bring people together for a period of healing and recovery."""

For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **  
Candidates – Council**



 **Alezix Heneti**



It would be incredibly rude to call Alezix batshit crazy. Bat shit can be used as a soil conditioner, fungicide and is excellent for speeding up the decomposition process in compost. Ms Heneti’s talents extend to [talking extremely fast about very little of interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmhKIdKv3GI&list=PLlToPizPkEm7bIdD89TQYufF7aSrjGBPf&index=4&t=0s), writing confusing, rambling and irrelevant [candidate statements](http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/webarchive/wayback/20160905080219/http://www.voteaucklandmayoralezixheneti.com/430068222) in UNDERLINED CAPITAL LETTERS, and packing her wardrobe with enough orange to replace the orange stickman working for the electoral commission.



If her autobiography is accurate, she has been a security guard working 7 nights a week, led a 120 staff telemarketing team, made $1.4 million in 22 minutes, stood in multiple elections in countless cities, lived all over the world while training sports teams 6 days a week every year for 25 years. Despite that, in 2016 she campaigned for Auckland Mayoralty and Albany Councillor, and despite breaking electoral law, remained fully confident in her ability to do both jobs at the same time. Based on this [notorious 2016 Mayoral Campaign Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFR6QNjYzAg), I suspect she’d be trespassed from the Town Hall within a week.   
  
Her 2016 policy program for Albany included cutting rates in half, doubling benefits for superannuitants, building KIWI Disneyland and [improving everything in Council by 10-1000%.](https://www.localmatters.co.nz/news/151-features-candidates-hibiscus-candidates-alezix-heneti-albany-ward.html)   




Her 2019 candidate profile reveals she is “outstanding and awesome.” On her way to becoming a “John Kehoe Mind Power Quantum Leap Graduate trained by Robin Banks, I discovered I am outstanding, awesome and amazing.”



Keep an eye out for this lady. Who says local elections have to be boring?



 **Julia Parfitt –** Independent **$$$**  




Julia was Deputy Mayor of the North Shore Council under Andrew Williams. Whether that makes her hungry for power under any circumstances or a tough cookie is for you to decide. Julia wants more funding for Local Boards and for the decisions that affect them to be made locally. Once I would have called that pork-barrelling to shore up her Local Board supporters, but as the amalgamation of the councils in 2010 has failed to result in efficiencies, I think that position has some merit.  




The growth of the city should be “environmentally sustainable and designed to enhance existing communities.” That’s politician speak for ‘I’m a red-tape NIMBY.’  




She wants money to be spent wisely (who doesn’t) and debt reduced but opposes asset sales. As for development contributions, Parfitt advocates spending those in the area from which they are sourced. Greater accountability for CCO’s and a new harbour crossing. I’m 100% on board with that but need to see more detail. If it is going to run parallel to the existing crossing then it’s a waste of money.



 **Wayne Walker –** Putting People First **$$**  




Walker is an award-winning speaker, having won non-specified NZ speaking competitions. Having listened to his slow, dull nasal tones in council meetings, where there is more silent space between each word uttered than actual speech, it just doesn’t seem possible. Surely he wouldn’t lie.



Walker is the consummate NIMBY, having fought against high-rise development proposals in Browns Bay, Milford and Orewa. He claimed that increased density drives up land prices, which is nonsense. Artificial land scarcity caused by excessive regulation drives up land prices, incentivising high-rise developments.  
  
This environmental warrior has put some truly stupid proposals to the council, such as advocating that half of the Chamberlain Golf Course be transformed into a wildlife sanctuary. “If ever there was a place where you could also have a wildlife sanctuary because golf courses essentially are fenced in part, then this is it,” he said.



Walker isn’t just an advocate of declaring a climate emergency, he actually went to Paris to witness the signing of the Paris Agreement.  
  
Walker has previously voted against large rates increases but never backed this up by trying to reduce spending. The only redeeming feature Walker has is his opposition to moving Western Springs Speedway.  




 **John Watson –** Putting People First **$$**  




This Putting People First ticket candidate claims to be 100% independent. He’s already pissed me off because he also claims to provide “honest, open leadership.”  




Watson also says he is committed to improving transport “getting people to destinations quicker through bus/ferry/northern motorway enhancements, congested intersection upgrades/parking and Penlink. Aside from the mention of ferries which are incredibly uneconomical and heavily subsidised, there is little else for me to object to but we have been hearing about Penlink for a very very very long time. How many more election campaigns can supporting a never built Penlink be a positive for Watson?



Watson, like Walker, voted for a $9.8 million grant to Eden Park. The alternative was making it an interest-free loan with no end date payable only if the land were to be sold. Like Walker, he congratulated AT on providing 20 more ferry sailings for Hobsonville and Beach Haven ferry users. Unlike Walker, he voted against the notorious 2015 budget which resulted in 9.9% rates increases. 



Not exactly independent but infinitely less annoying than his Putting People First running mate.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** There are two positions in Albany ward, so you get two votes. Julia Parfitt and John Watson.

Guest post by David Middleton
GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney recently released an outline of his plan to achieve “North American energy independence” by 2020. While the white paper (1) is short on specific details, it does contain quite a few good ideas and some supporting documentation. For anyone interested in a business plan approach to energy policy, it’s well worth reading. Rather than focus on the details of the plan, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see if “North American energy independence by 2020” was even technically possible. If it’s not technically possible, then it’s not really relevant whether or not it would be economically advisable or politically achievable. Since North America already pretty well has the capacity to be energy independent in terms of coal, natural gas, uranium and electricity generation, I’m only going to look at oil and natural gas liquids.
So, without any further prologue, I’m going to jump right into some numbers.
Can we “get there from here”?
According to the American Petroleum Institute (2) the current estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable Federal resources (UTRR-Fed) of crude oil currently stands at 116.3 billion barrels.
Figure 1. U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Federal Resources (American Petroleum Institute).
The UTRR-Fed are concentrated in areas close to existing exploration and exploitation infrastructure. The Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and the Lower 48 States comprise 88% of the UTRR-Fed.

There is no reason that these potential resources could not be exploited within the next few decades if the U.S. government adopted regulatory policies geared toward exploitation.
If industry converted the UTRR-Fed into proved developed producing reserves of crude oil over the next 25 years, this is what might happen to U.S. domestic crude oil production:
Figure 2. Potential exploitation scenario for the UTRR-Fed.
I think that it is technically possible that US crude oil and natural gas liquid production could reach 14.4 million BOPD by 2028 and peak at 15.7 million BOPD by 2032. If U.S. demand remained in the 18-20 million BOPD range, the United States could come very close to being self-sufficient in crude oil. I also took the liberty of including 73 billion barrels of Green River Oil Shale production from 2022-2100 (more on this later).
Canada expects to double its oil production by 2030 (3). Assuming that Canada’s domestic consumption remains stable and the U.S. remains Canada’s primary export market, Canadian imports could also be expected to double by 2030. While Mexican oil production is currently in decline and Pemex is one of the most poorly managed national oil companies (NOC) in the world, Mexico has huge potential in the area of undiscovered resources (4). Mexico does have the potential to stabilize its current production levels. If Canada doubles its production by 2030 and continues to increase its production through the end of this century and Mexico stabilizes at roughly its current levels, this is what U.S. domestic production plus Canadian and Mexican imports might look like:
Figure 3. U.S. UTRR-Fed plus Canadian and Mexican imports.
Based on these numbers, North American energy independence could be achieved by 2027.
116 billion barrels of ”undiscovered technically recoverable oil” is equal to about 16 years worth of current US consumption. However, past history shows us that gov’t agencies always grossly underestimate what the oil industry will find and produce. Alaska’s North Slope has already produced 16 billion barrels of petroleum liquids. Currently developed areas will ultimately produce a total of about 30 billion barrels. The government’s original forecast for the North Slope’s total production was 10 billion barrels. The current USGS estimate for undiscovered oil in the Bakken play of Montana & North Dakota is 25 times larger than the same agency’s 1995 estimate. In 1987, the MMS undiscovered resource estimate for the Gulf of Mexico was 9 billion barrels. Today it is 45 billion barrels (2).
The MMS increased the estimate of undiscovered oil in the Gulf of Mexico from 9 billion barrels in 1987 to the current 45 billion barrels because we discovered a helluva a lot more than 9 billion barrels in the Gulf over the last 20 years. Almost all of the large US fields discovered since 1988 were discovered in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988, it was unclear whether or not the deepwater plays would prove to be economic.The largest field in the Gulf of Mexico, Shell’s Mars Field, was discovered in 1989. Prior to this discovery, no one thought that economically viable Miocene-aged or older reservoirs existed in deepwater. Mars has produced 1 billion barrels of oil and 1.25 TCF of natural gas since coming on line in 1996. It is currently producing over 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Dozens of Mars-class fields have been discovered over the last 20 years… Most of those have only barely come on line over the last 5 years.
The most significant play in the Gulf of Mexico, the Lower Tertiary, wasn’t even a figment of anyone’s imagination in 1988. These are massive discoveries – BP’s recently discovered Tiber Field on Keathly Canyon Block 102 is estimated to contain 3-6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Several recently discovered fields are expected to come on line at more than 100,000 bbl/day. This play is still in its infancy.
Based on the gov’t’s track record, the estimated 116 billion barrels of undiscovered oil under Federal lands is more likely to be 680 billion barrels. That’s close to 100 years worth of current US consumption – And that’s just the undiscovered oil under Federal mineral leases.
When you factor in shale oil (kerogen) plays, the numbers become staggering. The Green River formation oil shale has more than 1 trillion barrels of recoverable oil just in the Piceance Basin of Colorado.

There are at least 1.8 trillion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil in just the Green River formation (DOE).
Oil shale deposits like the Green River formation (technically a marl) are currently economic at sustained oil prices of $54/bbl, possibly as low as $35/bbl (DOE).

In my hypothetical production forecast, I projected Green River oil shale production to reach 15 million BOPD by 2096. Am I being overly optimistic in projecting more than 15 million barrels per day (BOPD) of production from oil shales by 2100? Shell estimates that they could be producing 500,000 barrels per day from the Picenance Basin with a very small footprint using an in situ recovery process (5):
Technical Viability and Commercial Readiness (pp 18-24)
Shell has tested its in-situ process at a very small scale on Shell’s private holdings in the Piceance Basin. The energy yield of the extracted liquid and gas is equal to that predicted by the standardized assay test.13 The heating energy required for this process equals about one-sixth the energy value of the extracted product. These tests have indicated that the process may be technically and economically viable.
This approach requires no subsurface mining and thus may be capable of achieving high resource recovery in the deepest and thickest portions of the U.S. oil shale resource. Most important, the Shell in-situ process can be implemented without the massive disturbance to land that would be caused by the only other method capable of high energy/resource recovery—namely, deep surface mining combined with surface retorting. The footprint of this approach is exceptionally small. When applied to the thickest oil shale deposits of the Piceance Basin, drilling in about 150 acres per year could support sustained production of a half-million barrels of oil per day and 500 billion cubic feet per year of natural gas.
[…]
Once oil shale development reaches the production growth stage, how fast and how large the industry grows will depend on the economic competitiveness of shale derived oil with other liquid fuels and on how the issues raised in Chapter Five are ultimately resolved. If long lead-time activities are started in the prior stage, the first follow-on commercial operations could begin production within four years. Counting from the start of the production growth stage and assuming that 200,000 barrels per day of increased production capacity can be added each year, total production would reach 1 million barrels per day in seven years, 2 million barrels per day in 12 years, and 3 million barrels in 17 years.
Assuming a 12-yr lead time to reach the production growth stage, it will take ~30 years to reach 3 million barrels per day. If production continued to grow at a rate of 1 million BOPD every 5 years… Oil shale production from just the Piceance Basin could reach 15 million BOPD by the end of this century.
The hydrocarbon characteristics of the the oil shales of the Green River formation in the Piceance Basin are superior to those of the Athabasca oil sands. The hydrocarbon areal density is about 13 times that of the Athabasca deposits. The Green River hydrocarbons are not technically “oil;” it’s a form of kerogen. But, for or refining purposes, it’s oil. It will be booked as oil, just like the Athabasca tar sand oil is. It’s a high-grade refinery feedstock…
“Kerogen can be converted to superior quality jet fuel, #2 diesel, and other high value by-products.”
Canada is currently producing ~ 1 million barrels of oil per day from Athabasca oil sand deposits. They expect to increase that to 2 million barrels per day over the next decade. The Green River oil shale deposits in the Piceance basin could easily outperform Athabasca within a decade and with a much smaller environmental footprint.
Athabasca oil sands are currently economically competitive with the OPEC basket. Green River formation oil shales are superior, by a wide margin, to Athabasca oil sands. The Green River oil shales would yield 100,000 bbl of 38° API sweet refinery feed per 160,000 tons of ore & overburden. Athabasca oil sands yield 100,000 bbl of 34° sweet refinery feed per 430,000 tons of ore & overburden. The unconventional oil is actually very light and very sweet; the OPEC Basket is actually heavier (32.7° API).
Athabasca is economically competitive now. Green River could be economically competitive now. The only obstacles to US energy security are environmental terrorists activists and the U.S. government.
“Peak Oil,” if it exists, won’t be reached for hundreds of years if the U.S. government would just get out of the way. About 80% of the most prospective Green River deposits are under Federal leases. The Obama administration effectively blocked exploitation of the Green River oil shale earlier this year.
Does Policy Matter?
Bad policy certainly matters. “One bipartisan policy tradition is to deny Americans the use of our own resources” (6):
Figure 4. Bad Policy Matters.
The Obama administration’s energy policy has been disastrous as it relates to oil production. While it is true that U.S. domestic oil production has been rising over the last few years, all of the growth has come from onshore plays in Texas and North Dakota:
Figure 5. Comparison of daily oil production rates: Federal Gulf of Mexico, Texas and North Dakota (EIA).
Some of the Texas (less than 1%) and North Dakota (~11%) production is from Federal leases. I downloaded the onshore Federal lease production data for Texas and North Dakota from Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR) and subtracted the minuscule Federal lease production from the State and private lease production in those two States. I added that to theFederal Gulf of Mexico production (the GOM is the Big Kahuna of Federal lease oil production):
Figure 6. State and private lease production in Texas and North Dakota vs. Federal lease production in the Gulf of Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.
All of the net growth in US domestic oil production since 2009 has come from State and private leases in Texas and North Dakota.
Since President Obama took office, Federal lease oil production in the GOM, TX and ND has declined by 79 million barrels per year; while State and private lease production in TX & ND has grown by 205 million barrels per year. The decline in Gulf of Mexico has occurred during a period of high oil prices and is directly attributable to the unlawful drilling moratorium and “permitorium” imposed in the wake of the Macondo blowout and oil spill. Drilling permits that once took 30 days to be approved now take more than 300 days. Even relatively simple things like the approval of development plan (DOCD) revisions are being drawn out to nearly 300 days. The average delays for independent oil companies are currently 1.4 years on the shelf and almost 2 years in deepwater (7):
Figure 7. Average Gulf of Mexico permit delays (Quest Offsore Resources).
Between the “permitorium” and high product prices, many of the best, most capable drilling rigs have been moved overseas. Once we manage to get permits approved, the delays in obtaining a rig can be almost as long as the permit delays were. In this “dynamic regulatory environment,” wells can’t be drilled quickly enough to compensate for decline rates, much less to increase production.

Simon Bridges left the door open in opposing the second reading of the Zero Carbon Bill and while he was still making up his mind about it, two of his ministers came out in opposition. 



In this interview with Corin Dann, Bridges says he expects his ministers to toe the party line – even though they don’t know what that is!



 **Corin:**



Are you prepared to let any of you MPs cross the floor on a potential vote on a carbon ah zero bill? There has been some speculation from Richard Harman that Judith Collins may be open to crossing the floor if that bill is not ah to her liking. 



**Simon:**



N…no I don’t accept that MPs can or should cross the floor. It’s a situation in the National Party where on conscience issues you get a free vote – you certainly don’t where the party has decided the position.



To be clear on our position on that bill we haven’t decided yet, we may well vote against it, which I think was the tenor of the Harman ah piece ah there. Ah but we know our position quite clearly on methane targets and the economic impact and we will be pushing for changes so that we can support it. 



**Corin:**



So, sorry have you hardened your position here? You might vote against this bill? 



**Simon:**



I don’t think it’s a hardening. I think if you go back ah, I’ve said this before, but you go back over a year ago to a speech I gave at the field days… I… I’ve known exactly where National stands on these issues. Those positions haven’t changed, we worry about the methane target, we worry about the wider economic impact, we will be pushing for changes in the committee of the whole house ah as they call it, if they don’t ah… if we don’t see changes we may well vote against it, but of course we would like to support it because the majority of the bill, the architecture if you like, actually is much of our plan. 



**Corin:**



Has Judith Collins indicated she would vote against it, to you? 



**Simon:**



Ah, look I’m not going to characterise what happens in caucus, what is said, there’s a range of views in National. I could be candid with you about that. From those who say, you know what, we really should be supporting this, through to those who are much more reluctant given the rural supporters they have in rural NZ and the clear worry from farmers about this. 



Look, I’m not pretending it’s an easy issue for National, or indeed for NZ, and we are grappling with those things right now. We do know our position though and we will be seeking changes in the ah process through parliament. 



Judith Collins publicly opposed the bill. 



“National MP Judith Collins says she will vote against the Zero Carbon Bill in its present form thus apparently pre-empting her Leader and caucus who have made no final decision on what to do.



Her statement is being interpreted to mean that she would be prepared to vote against National if they agree to support the Bill. 



**And in making her pledge she is leaving National Leader Simon Bridges facing a political dilemma which could see him lose support whichever choice he makes.”**



  
Matt King has a bob each way. He supports the farmers but also doesn’t want to abandon the party position, describing himself as a “climate enquirer”. 



“The Northland MP [Matt King] copped heavy criticism over the weekend for a social media post that claimed climate change “is natural” and accused the Government of unfairly targeting farmers in efforts to lower carbon emissions.”



[…] On Sunday King tweeted that he’s a “climate inquirer” rather than a denier.



“I think everyone’s an enquirer, aren’t they?” he said on Tuesday when asked about the term. “We’re all finding out what the story is.” 



His National Party colleagues were less enthused about embracing the identity of “climate enquirer”, with Gerry Brownlee, Chris Penk and Nicky Wagner all denying they’d encountered the term before. 



[…]” **Everyone in the National Party believes that climate change is real,”** Chris Bishop told media.”” 



  
Bridges should thank Chris Bishop for taking the party line despite not knowing quite what that line is. 



But Bridges has a bigger problem with Collins who outstrips him in the popularity polls and now in climate change as well; showing decisive leadership where he did not. 



Collins gave Bridges a golden opportunity to establish his leadership by propelling the party into a decisive stance against the bill, but instead, he prevaricated. 



Bridges defended his party’s acceptance of the large $150,000 Chinese donation. [He argues that no laws were broken](https://thebfd.co.nz/wp-admin/post.php?post=494083&action=edit) but conveniently forgets the spirit of that law, which is to avoid political parties being influenced by representatives from foreign countries. It is highly doubtful that someone giving a large sum of money would not expect some sort of consideration. It’s another example of weak leadership.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that global temperatures have not risen in 15 years, a number of scientists find themselves having great difficulty coming to terms with that new reality.

The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) claims that the latest prognoses confirm the model forecasts. Photo source: Max Planck Gesellschaft
The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg is no exception. For years the institute insisted that the man-made climate catastrophe was real and happening now. Today it finds itself scrambling for a backdoor. “Otto et al” is that back door.
The MPI-M recently issued a press release with interesting revelations about the now famous “Otto et al” paper, to which its two directors contributed.
When we read the MPI-M press release, we quickly discover that this Otto et al paper is actually just the latest in speculative crystal-ballwork – the results have little value other than to provide a desperately needed face-saving opportunity for accepting a lower CO2 climate sensitivity.
The problem that climate science is having today is that it finds itself clashing with the fundamental rule of science itself. Richard Feynman once said on how science works:
1. Guess
2. Compute consequences
3. Compare to actual observations
If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make a difference how beautiful your guess is. It doesn’t make difference how smart you are, the person who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagrees with experiment, then it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.”
Today we know that warming has stopped, and so that means the computed climate consequences are in disagreement with the observations, thus showing that the MPI-M’s earlier “guess” is wrong. Do they accept that today?
No. The MPI-M refuses to admit that “the guess” is wrong. What it does instead that it redefines the scientific approach used in the Otto et al study and in its press release. For the MPI-M the new rule of science is:
1. Guess
2. Compute consequences (with computers)
3. Compare to other newly computed consequences
And you keep computing new consequences until you get agreement! This is what the 2 scientists at the Max Plank Institute together with the team of scientists led by Otto have done, and nothing more.
The MPI starts its press release by telling readers not to be fooled by the warming pause (my emphasis):

Global warming continues to baffle climate scientists, but one thing is sure: Over the next decades the average mean temperature on Earth will increase, even if the increase in the years from 2001 – 2010 was much slower than the decade before. This is backed up by prognoses from an international team of scientists led by scientists at the University of Oxford, of which both directors Jochem Marotzke and Björn Stevens of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology were a part. Using the current climate data, the scientists have newly calculated how much the air and Earth’s surface will have warmed up as soon as the CO2 concentration in the air doubles.”
And later in the press release (my emphasis):
Jochem Marotzke is part of a team of the world’s most renowned climate scientists who have taken the most recent development of the surface temperature into account in order to forecast how the Earth will heat up from the greenhouse effect, foremost from carbon dioxide (CO2). These prognoses confirm that the climate models correctly forecast global warming trend over multiple decades, that is until the middle or the end of the 21st century. There is no wise reason for calling off the alarm.”
This is pure quackery. At the MPI, prognoses confirm forecasts?
MPI-M postpones warming, will take hundreds of years
The MPI press release also says that we are going to have to wait a lot longer than we first thought for the real warming to hit:
Because the climate has a very high thermal inertia and the oceans warm up only very slowly, it’s going to take some time before the effects of the greenhouse gases completely take hold. A warming from the greenhouse effect will be amplified by numerous feedbacks, and weakened by a few processes. Only when this complicated interaction quiets down will the climate come to a stable condition. This long-term reaction by the climate is called equilibrium climate sensitivity (ESC) and is calculated by climate scientists. It is the final temperature increase that comes from a doubling of CO2  concentration, and will probably occur first after a few hundred years.”
Remember that this press release was written by two scientists, Marotzke and Stevens, who participated directly on the Otto et al study.
So we are going to have to wait decades, maybe even centuries before the real warming hits. That’s what Otto et al says, they tell us. There aren’t any observations to check if that forecast is reliable, but the MPI-M says they have a new forecast, it agrees with the models, and so the theory is correct.
The press release adds:
Using these values, the scientists calculate with 90% certainty that the near-surface atmosphere will warm 0.9°C – 2.0°C with at doubling of CO2 content; most probable is a temperature increase of 1.3°C.”
They used the 90% certainty claim in the past, and wound up totally wrong. Now they are claiming it once again, based on computer prognoses, and not on observations. This is the SOP of charlatans, and not scientists.
There’s more in the press release, especially with respect uncertainty. Basically they are saying that the “90% certainty” is fraught with lots of uncertainty. More tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC has issued a press release on the release of the AR summary report for policymakers. You can find it here. 
We are witnessing a disgraced science, one that is desperately clinging to catastrophe and relevance. The Summary Report for Policymakers (SPM) resembles an amateur magician’s show where everybody already knows all the tricks used to create the illusions. But the policymakers will act like they’ve seen the show for the first time.
The press release says “it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century“. The report fails to acknowledge that global temperatures have been at a standstill for the last 15 years, claiming rather that “each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850” – a statistical sleight of hand.
In the Summary Report for Policymakers (SPM), the hockey stick chart disappears completely. There’s no mention of temperature conditions during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period. Almost all the charts shown in the SPM go back only to the 20th century, and thus provide an incomplete and misleading picture of historical temperature developments. The Medieval Period was as warm, if not warmer, than today’s temperature. Obviously the concept of the temperature hockey stick is an embarrassment that the IPCC is eager to relegate to the dustbin of history.
The SPM also completely neglects solar activity and its possible connection to the current global cooling taking place. In Figure SPM.5, the chart attributes practically no climate impact from the sun, although the historical data shows there’s a powerful correlation between solar activity and global temperature.
The IPCC also fails to report that global temperatures have not risen at all since the Third Assessment Report of 2001. Moreover, the chart comparing model projections to observations, which appeared in a draft report leaked late last year, disappeared in the new Summary Report for Policymakers.
CO2 climate sensitivity figures have also been scaled back. The IPCC now projects a warming of only 1.5°C or more over the 21st century. In the 2007 report that figure was 2°C and up.
The press release, however, insists that sea level rise will accelerate, later in the future. But until then we will just have to remain patient. Strangely the sea level projection chart on page 35 deletes the past, and begins only at 2008.
This is going to be an easy report to dismantle. Global warming “science” is on its last leg.

"**New rules for pubs are ""insulting"" and ""a huge slap in the face"" for the sector, said the boss of Wales' biggest brewers.**
Alistair Darby of Brains called on politicians to ""stop changing their mind"" on what is required.
Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from selling alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT.
Mark Drakeford said the new rules will tackle a rise in coronavirus cases.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry are upset, but admitted there is ""no perfect balance"" between protecting public health and businesses.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, he added: ""What we can do is make sure more of us will be here in the future to celebrate life events.""
However Mr Darby said the move suggests pubs and restaurants are areas of ""high transmission"".
""It's hugely frustrating and a bit insulting. It says people are not making the effort being asked of them,"" he said.
UK government Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said restrictions had been lifted too quickly after Wales' 17-day firebreak.
He told BBC Breakfast he sympathised with the Welsh Government, but added: ""As a result of doing that, the virus once more got out of control, so they've had to slam the brakes on again.
""The example of Wales shows what can happen if you lift the restrictions in too blanket a way too soon.""
The Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of putting jobs at risk with the new rules.
Brains employs 1,400 people and has 104 pubs, but Mr Darby said the move will be felt by many thousands of other workers who supply the industry, such as electricians, plumbers and caterers.
""It will have an impact on a huge number of people who make a living from the sector and our communities who, I fear, will be deprived the opportunity to visit a pub this Christmas.""
Mr Drakeford said new measures are necessary or there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths this winter.
The Brains boss said: ""The sector has done more than its fair share to ensure those potential deaths are avoided.
""And at the end of this, we will be asking, if lives aren't saved, what the answer will be?""
The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package"" anywhere in the UK.
However Mr Darby said the support ""would not touch the sides"".
As an Â£80m turnover business, Brains spent Â£500,000 in personal protective equipment (PPE) and digital technology for pre-booking, while it has ""surrendered"" huge capacity and lost summer trading, Mr Darby added.
He said: ""My message to politicians is 'you have to stop changing your mind on what is required in the sector'.
""We have done more than our fair share to ensure potential deaths are avoided at the end of this.""
David Cattrall, managing director of Harlech Foodservice, warned that many hospitality businesses would not survive the latest round of restrictions.
""There is a palpable sense of frustration, bewilderment and anger at the restrictions being placed upon the hospitality sector in north and mid Wales,"" he said.
""The rate of the virus is lower here than in south Wales so it defies logic that we are being subjected to this damaging one-size-fits-all policy.
""The run-up to Christmas is when the sector makes enough money to keep them going through the quiet months of January and February but it's clear now that Christmas has been cancelled as far as the hospitality sector is concerned.""
Businesses need an exit plan and reassurance they will be able to open at Easter ""as a matter of urgency"", he added.
KellyÂ Jolliffe, owner and landlady of The Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, said she was ""gutted"" about the new restrictions.
""I was expecting it, I was hoping that it would only be shutting at 6pm, which I think we could all have managed with and could have all worked around,"" she said.
""But when he banned the alcohol, I just thought there's no point really - we're a pub!""
She told Radio Wales Breakfast she has decided to close, despite having got the pub ready for the Christmas trade.
""We were all decked out, all socially distanced, bookings coming in, everybody working around the regulations,"" she said.
Tory covid recovery spokesman Darren Millar said the restrictions could affect jobs across Wales.
He added: ""With one in 10 of the Welsh workforce employed by hospitality enterprises and with so many relying on pre-Christmas trade, the Welsh Government is now putting tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods at risk."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Westfalen-Blatt quotes Russian news agency Itar-Tass:
After a failed rescue attempt by an icebreaker sent to free 74 participants of an Antarctic expedition that became trapped in polar ice, a large number of them are to be rescued by air.
It has been decided to rescue 52 passengers and four crew members using a helicopter from the Chinese “Snow Dragon” ice breaker, so reports the Itar-Tass news agency Monday, refering to the Russian Foreign Ministry.”
It appears the Russians see no further purpose for the scientists to remain on their MS Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel, which they’ve hired out to them, and will leave behind a bare crew of 18 in the hopes of salvaging the ship. The Akademik Shokalskiy has been trapped in unexpected dense, thick sea ice since December 24.
Stormy forecast
Whether conditions will allow a helicopter rescue on Tuesday is questionable. The weather forecast for Mawson shows blizzardy conditions through Tuesday. Currently winds are blowing at near 70 km/h from 120° east-southeast. Temperatures will fall over the course of the next 10 days.

The Westfalen-Blatt writes that there is no information on when and how the remaining 18 will be rescued.
Turney gets dose of “shocking” reality
The last rescue attempt by an Australian icebreaker was abandoned due to a “dangerous snowstorm” which expedition leader Chris Turney called “shocking”.
Imagine that: global warming causing a million extra square kilometers of thick, impenetrable sea ice and dangerous, “shocking” snowstorms.
This is what we call fantasy being contradicted by reality.

Saint Greta of Thunberg is splashing the headlines for getting an all-expenses-paid jaunt with daddy across the Atlantic on a very flash, very fast yacht. I wouldn’t mind that experience either. But St Greta is stacking up brownie points by the dozen with this exercise in virtue signalling. It is all so “zero carbon”. 



Team Malizia, skippered by Pierre Casiraghi and Boris Herrmann have **the great honour and pleasure** to sail Greta Thunberg from the UK to New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on Malizia II. The journey will start in mid-August. Greta accepted the offer to sail with Team Malizia as **Malizia is a zero-carbon mode of transport** to reach the USA. […]



[…] The sailboat is outfitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to allow for a **zero-carbon** , trans-Atlantic voyage.



Greta is taking a sabbatical year from school, and aims to attend a number of events during her time in North America, meeting with people most impacted by the climate and ecological emergency, climate activists, and decision-makers. […]



Greta doesn’t fly because of the tremendous amount of emissions caused by air travel – emissions that are strongly amplified due to the fact that they are released high-up in the atmosphere. She will therefore choose the least carbon-intensive modes of transportation throughout her travels across the Americas.



After months of research and considering different options for her journey, Greta will sail across the Atlantic in a **zero-carbon** racing boat called Malizia II, a foiling sailboat built in 2015, which is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate electricity on board the vessel. Greta will be joined on board the boat by her father Svante Thunberg and filmmaker Nathan Grossman of **B-Reel** Films, who will document the journey.



  
 **B-Reel** films! What a laugh.



From the image above of Malizia II, you can clearly see that the yacht was hand azed from a single trunk of an ancient tree. Oops, no, trees have carbon so we can’t use wood for our zero carbon means of Atlantic transport.



No, this fine piece of nautical engineering was fabricated by [Multiplast](https://www.multiplast.eu/en/the-company.html). Their name gives a clue and their website lays it out quite clearly



Since 1981, Multiplast has been designing and manufacturing multihulls and monohulls in high tech **composite materials** with unparalleled performance (Atlantic records, the Jules Verne Trophy, Route de Rhum, the Volvo Ocean Race…)



Multiplast has rapidly forged a reputation, becoming the world leader in performance boat construction as well as in the use of **high performance composite materials,** allowing it to work with world renowned naval architects.



  
Yes, the yacht is built from carbon fibre materials. The website proudly states that Multiplast recycle raw materials (pre-preg polypropylene film, cardboard, acetone…) 



Oh dear, polypropylene comes from the petrochemical industry, cardboard is carbon based, acetone is an organic compound because carbon atoms are present in acetone’s chemical formula. It consists of three carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.



Not doing so well in the zero carbon stakes are we?



All these composite materials are heated in ovens to cure, these ovens require energy. The entire production factory is air-conditioned.



Its 5,300 m2 is divided into four 50x30m air conditioned hangars, with controlled temperature and humidity levels (21°C ±3oC, humidity <65%). 



To provide that amount of precise air-conditioning requires a heap of energy.



There is not a chance that the fine vessel Malizia II could exist in a zero-carbon world.

"**No 10 has published data behind its decisions over England's new tier system as it tries to win MPs' support.**
Downing Street's report said it sought to ""balance the many complex impacts"" of restrictions and keep them in place ""for as short a time as possible"".
It said allowing the virus to spread exponentially ""would lead to impacts... considered intolerable for society"".
But senior Tory MP Mark Harper said the ""wheels are coming off the government's arguments"".
MPs will vote on the plans on Tuesday.
The government announced its tougher three tiers to tackle the virus last week, with Boris Johnson telling reporters on Monday: ""We can't afford to take our foot off the throat of the beast... to let it out of control again.""
But a number of Tory backbenchers have threatened to vote against the motion when it comes to the Commons, including the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of MPs - chaired by Mr Harper.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would abstain on the vote, saying he had ""serious misgivings"" about the measures.
But he said it was ""in the national interest"" to let the restrictions pass through the Commons without Labour's opposition to ensure some measures were in place.
A No 10 spokesman accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic, instead of working with the government to find a way through this difficult time for the British people"".
England's current lockdown will end in the early hours of Wednesday 2 December and will see the country placed into one of three tiers: medium (one), high (two) and very high (three).
However, the majority of the country, over 55 million, will be under the strictest two sets of measures.
The announcement led to criticism from some Tory MPs, who were concerned about the impact in their constituencies.
Mr Johnson wrote to his party twice over the weekend to appeal for their backing and to grant some of the CRG's demands.
They included the publication of the data on the health, social and economic impact of the tiers, and the promise MPs could vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February.
But the government report - published on Monday \- said it was ""not possible to forecast the precise economic impact of a specific change to a specific restriction with confidence"".
The document is largely made up of information already available.
It said the challenge of balancing health and societal impacts was not straightforward, but the government would continue to pursue the best overall outcomes.
The chair of the Treasury select committee, Tory MP Mel Stride, condemned the report as ""a rehashed document [that] offers very little further in economic terms"".
He told the BBC he would support the government to ensure there were some restrictions in place, but added: ""It's frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country.
""Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document.""
The CRG chair, Mr Harper, said the report ""seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny"".
He repeated accusations that the government's modelling on deaths and hospital capacity had been wrong, adding: ""We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections and they have not been forthcoming.""
While Labour will abstain, the Liberal Democrats have said they will not back the plan - although it is not clear whether they will vote against or abstain.
The SNP will abstain in the vote, as it only covers restrictions in England.
With many of the opposition MPs abstaining, it would take a huge Tory rebellion for the measures to fall, which is unlikely.
At first glance there doesn't appear to be much, if any, new information in this document.
The government's analysis draws on studies and data already in the public domain to try to assess the impact of the tiered system of restrictions.
So will it convince Conservative MPs sceptical about the need for tighter restrictions that they are, in fact, necessary?
Yes and no.
Some Tory backbenchers may be satisfied the government has at least attempted to provide further evidence that tougher measures are needed. They've made their point.
Others will flick through the 48 pages and discard it, knowing all along that without some elusive magic formula the government could provide, they would never have been convinced.
The government is likely to win Tuesday's vote, but as the pandemic wears on, it is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep its own MPs on side.
Speaking shortly before the data was published, Mr Johnson said he ""understood people's frustration"" with the stricter tiers.
He said: ""The tiering system is tough, but it is designed to be tough to keep [the virus] under control.""
""What we can't do is forsake and abandon all the gains we have made now just when we are starting to see real progress in the science.""
In the report, the government pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a rapid increase in people testing positive for the virus between September and November - from 59,800 a week to 633,000 a week.
It said the new ""strengthened"" tier system was ""designed to keep R [the infection rate] below one so that prevalence continues to fall, the significant impacts of the virus are reduced, and so that, ultimately, fewer restrictions are required.""
It added that a ""stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy"", with the government's view being ""the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society"".
The document also pointed to the economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which were published alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spending review last week - predicting the value of the economy will fall by 11.3% by the end of the financial year.
But, while the report conceded there would be ""major impacts"" on the economy from the restrictions, it added: ""Any attempt to estimate the specific economic impacts of precise changes to individual restrictions for a defined period of time would be subject to such wide uncertainty as to not be meaningful for precise policy making"".
Labour leader Sir Keir defended his party's decision to abstain on the vote for measures, saying it was ""better that these regulations can be amended and put in place than if there are no regulations"".
He said the ""serious misgivings"" he had included over the performance of the test and trace system and ""real concerns"" over the level of economic support for those in the highest tiers.
But, Sir Keir added: ""Although the number of cases is coming down as a result of lockdown, the virus is still a significant risk and in principal we accept there is going to have to be continued restrictions.""
However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs."

Ow, that’s gotta hurt. CA’s 2006 Global Warming law – denied.

Federal judge blocks California low-carbon fuels rule
Chico Enterprise Record
FRESNO — A federal judge moved today to block California from enforcing its first-in-the-nation mandate for cleaner, low-carbon fuels, saying the rules favor biofuels produced in the state.

The lawsuit challenging the state regulations, which were adopted as part of the state’s landmark 2006 global warming law, was filed in federal court last year by a coalition including the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association and the Consumer Energy Alliance.
Fresno-based U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence O’Neill’s written ruling Thursday said the low-carbon fuel rules violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause by discriminating against crude oil and biofuels producers located outside California.
Out-of-state fuels producers hailed the decision as a win for California drivers.

According to the American Federation for Children, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Todd Rokita (R-IN) have reintroduced “the Educational Opportunities Act, which would create an individual and corporate tax credit for donations that pay for scholarships for students to attend a private school of their parents’ choice.”   
  
  
It is encouraging to see growing support for scholarship tax credit school choice programs, which have been found to simultaneously boost achievement for students who switch to private schools, do the same for students who remain in public schools, and save taxpayers millions of dollars every year–a win‐​win‐​win scenario. Nevertheless, it is ill advised to pursue such a program (or other school choice programs) at the federal level.   
  
  
Years ago I summarized those problems when President George W. Bush advocated creating a federal school voucher program. Such programs are not only beyond the mandate accorded to Congress by the Constitution, they bear the risk of suffocating private schools nationwide with a raft of new regulation, defeating their very purpose of increasing the range of educational options available to families with limited means.   
  
  
In the past few years I have visited Sweden and Chile and studied their federal school chioce programs. Both confirm my earlier worries about national programs. Chile’s entrepreneurial voucher schools grew rapidly at first, but with a recent change of government hostile to the program they have sensed the new climate and stopped expanding.The new government is trying to enact regulations to diminish the scope and freedom of private schooling in Chile.   
  
  
Meanwhile, something similar is happening in Sweden. Among other things, the government has mandated that all schools hire graduates of government‐​certified teacher training programs, despite the well known fact that those programs are currently attracting the lowest‐​achieving college students.   
  
  
National school choice programs have proven to be a prime case of “staff car legislating.” The legislators who enact them are not always the ones in the official staff cars, making the rules. New lawmakers with different preferences ultimately come to power and can wreak havok on a nation’s entire K-12 education sector.   
  
  
This problem can be minimized by leaving school choice legislation to the state level, where the Constitution rightfully leaves it. We thus have a “laboratory of federalism”–a variety of different policies across states that make it easier to determine how best to design such programs.

This gives credence to Dr. Roy Spencer’s population adjusted ISH surface temperature data for the USA
Figure 4. Correlation between night-time surface temperature andpopulation density.
Impact of population density on the surface temperature and micro-climate
of Delhi
Javed Mallick1 and Atiqur Rahman2,* 1Department of Civil Engineering, King Khalid University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2Remote Sensing and GIS Division, Department of Geography, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi 110 025, India
Abstract:
Increasing urban surface temperature due to change of natural surfaces is one of the growing environmental problems in urban areas, especially in cities like Delhi. The present work is an attempt to assess the urban surface temperature in Delhi using remote sensing and GIS techniques. ASTER datasets of thermal bands were used to assess the land surface temperature (LST) using temperature emissivity separation technique. Ward-wise population density was calculated from the Census of India 2001 data to correlate the population density with LST. The study shows that surface temperature changes with the increase in the impervious surface area, which is related to the increase in the population density.
From the discussion: 
Figure 4 shows the correlation between surface temperature and population density. A strong positive correlation between the two can be seen. The value of logarithmic regression (R2) is 0.748. The logarithmic regression equation between surface temperature and population density is Y = 1.059ln × Pop-density + 22.40. It means that with the increase in population density, surface temperature also increases. Furthermore, it is possible to predict night-time surface temperature on the basis of known population density.
….
Oke used the empirical method to represent the relationship between urban–rural temperatures as concentration on population. It is not easy to separate many contributors to the problem. However, one of the most noticeable and one that has proven to have an
extremely strong correlation with the UHI phenomenon or urban surface temperature is the population density of major cities32. The present study demonstrates a close
relationship between the population density, built-up area and surface temperature. The statistical analysis of nighttime surface temperature with population density indicates
that population growth tends to contribute to the urban surface temperature rise or UHI intensity and also to the micro-climate of Delhi.
In earlier times and even now, there are very few meteorological stations to record the surface temperature, and they may not be the true representative for the whole city. In such situations, LST derived from thermal satellite data are useful to study the variation of surface temperature over the entire city area that is an important parameter for micro-climate of urban areas. This study clearly shows spatial variation of LST over entire Delhi.
By superposing the population density map of Delhi over the surface temperature map, it can be clearly seen that high population density is one of the main contributing
factors for the high surface temperature, UHI intensity and also micro-climate of Delhi. To assess and address the issue of micro-climate and also to mitigate the impact of UHI on the city population, the outcome of such types of studies may be useful.

"If ever a crisis proved that our fates are bound together, it has been the last six weeks. The state has asked many businesses to stand idle to save lives, firms have turned to the state as their guarantor of survival and workers have risked their lives for us all. When we have faced our toughest test for decades as a nation, it has been essential to pull together. Yet we are only at the beginning of the need to recognise the mutual dependence between public and private sectors and our collective solidarity.  The effects of this pandemic are arbitrary and catastrophic and no business or worker should have to face them alone. This spirit must carry us through not just the continuing “rescue” part of the emergency but into recovery and renewal to build a different economy. The chancellor says he cannot “save every business”, but that should not hide the fact that every business that goes bust because of necessary public health measures represents not just a failure of that business but risks deepening the recession — and impeding recovery. The lesson of past crises is that at the time governments believe that the danger is doing too much, too quickly – but the bigger danger is that they do too little, too slowly. Doing everything we can to protect businesses and workers makes sense for the taxpayer because the fiscal cost of lost businesses, unemployed workers and lost tax revenue outweighs the cost of acting. That is why, for example, Labour has led the argument for reform of the government’s loan system to make it work not just for 25,000 SMEs out of nearly six million as it has so far, but for many, many more. It is good that change is now coming. We have also argued for and welcomed the furlough scheme, though there remain significant gaps for some of the self-employed. This week the government will start to provide a sense of our likely emergence from lockdown. There will be sectors that cannot reopen for months. Take the hospitality sector, with over three million jobs. Twenty-five thousand outlets, including pubs and restaurants, are missing out on the targeted grants to cover their costs.  Thousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of workers. Essential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help. The government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including where necessary an extension of the furlough scheme — with greater flexibility to enable part-time working — and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes. There are also parts of our economy which warrant particular attention. One lesson from this crisis is that our domestic manufacturing base matters far more than has previously been acknowledged. This is an issue of national and economic security, and the government should be willing to step in on the right terms. Yet just as our mutual dependence means the state owes responsibilities to support the private sector, so those who get state support owe obligations to the taxpayer. If you’re registered in a tax haven and you want support, you should come onshore. If you’re a multinational and plan to pay dividends to shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don’t need them.  The public should look back on the support it has given business over this period with pride. That also means ensuring the gains from public support accrue to all of us, and not just the losses. The government should be willing to consider an equity stake in firms — particularly when there is a compelling economic or environmental rationale.  The need for public and private to work together with imagination will also be essential as we seek to emerge from what could be the deepest recession for 300 years. During this crisis we have seen thousands of workers redeployed from sectors that have closed. Let’s learn the lesson of what is possible. We know that the climate emergency is a challenge we can simply no longer afford to ignore. Let’s create an army of zero carbon workers, retraining and redeploying those who can’t work into different industries, from home insulation to wind turbine manufacture to tree planting. We also cannot ignore the deep lessons of this crisis about the world of work, including about the role of unions. It is the lowest-paid workers whom we have relied on. We need a new bargain tackling powerlessness and insecurity.  In these testing times and beyond, the spirit of common endeavour we have seen in the first phase of this crisis must animate what we do. Together state, business and workers must share the risks and burdens we face. Even out of this emergency, we can and must build a better tomorrow.

By Ed Caryl
Sometime in the last year, someone commented in some article that sea level rise as observed by satellite radar altimetry was overstated due to the fact that as warm water expands, it gets lighter, gravity has less pull on it, and it bulges up. Since then, a couple of global maps have come to my attention. First, a map of sea level rise.

Figure 1 is sea level rise trend since 1993. Source University of Colorado.
Now compare this to the ocean heat content anomaly map for roughly the same period.

Figure 2 is ocean heat content anomaly 0 to 300 meters as of January 2012. Source.
They look alike, don’t they? The colors in most of the two map areas match. They would match almost exactly if the scale colors were the same. But they are supposed to be measuring different things. But where there is ocean heat (red and orange) in Figure 2, there is sea level rise (red and orange) in Figure 1. Conversely, where the ocean is cooler it is lower. Hot is higher sea level, cool is lower sea level. The western Pacific is warmer and higher than the eastern Pacific. The warm current east of Japan is higher in sea level. Cool spots in the Southern Ocean are lower in sea level.

As was suggested in the first paragraph, as a particular spot in the ocean warms, like the western Pacific warm pool, the surface expands upward. This has nothing to do with most of the coastlines of the world. Where the water is shallow, the slight expansion will not be noticed. As you can see on the map, sea levels all along the west coast of the Americas, and some other areas, are falling because those ocean areas are cooling. For other coastal areas, sea levels are rising slowly, at about the rate measured by tide gauges since the 19th century, 1.7 mm/year.
Sea level rise as measured by satellites is measuring mid-ocean sea level heat differences. The most glaring example is the western Pacific warm pool. They are not measuring coastal sea levels where people live. In fact, the satellite radar altimetry measurements specifically reject measurements within 50 km of a coast.
All of this means that radar altimetry is useless for measuring sea level that makes any difference to infrastructure planners. It is only useful as another CAGW bogeyman. The University of Colorado even admits this here, (my emphasis):
“GMSL is a good indicator of changes in the volume of water in the oceans due to mass influx (e.g., land ice melt) and density changes (e.g., thermal expansion), and is therefore of interest in detecting climate change.”
Coastal infrastructure planners don’t care about volume, they care about depth, at the shore, at high tide, and that has nothing to do with “climate change”.

"If you could ask British insects about the habitats they prefer, they’d probably tell you that you can’t improve on grassland that’s rich with wildflowers. For farmers, though, grassland is said to be “improved” if it has been treated with fertiliser and sown with fast growing grasses.  “Unimproved” grasslands are those that have not had their productivity improved for agriculture. They’re semi-natural habitats, because if mowing or grazing stopped, they’d quickly turn to scrub and then woodland. These unimproved grasslands are extremely rich in the number of species they can support, sometimes having well over 40 species of flowering plant in a single square metre.  But since World War II, 97% of unimproved grassland habitats have vanished from the UK. This has contributed to the loss of pollinating insects – and the distribution of one third of species has shrunk since 1980.

      Insects: species that prefer crops prosper while majority decline


 If you’re lucky enough to have a garden, your lawn can be thought of as a small patch of artificial grassland, which will usually have only a few species of turf grass. Most suburbs and villages still have around a quarter to a third of their area covered by grass.  Unfortunately, lawns are largely featureless and offer little refuge for small creatures like bugs and other invertebrates. Regular mowing also prevents plants from flowering and producing seeds, which is why carefully maintained lawns are mostly barren.  But lawns can be made into important wildlife habitat by changing how they’re managed. This is an idea that’s gaining traction – campaigns such as “Say No to the Mow” have made an “unkempt” garden more socially acceptable. For anyone wanting to create a wildlife lawn in their garden, there are four important steps to follow. The first step is simple. By raising the height that the mower blade cuts the grass to its highest setting – usually about 4 cm off the ground – you can provide more variety in the lawn’s structure and more refuge for other plant and invertebrate species.  By mowing less often you can allow plants time to flower and provide a food source for bees and other pollinators. Leaving gaps between mowing in spring gives time for species like the cowslip to flower – a plant which has declined markedly in the UK but which butterflies like the Duke of Burgundy depend on for laying their eggs.  Summer gaps can allow species like cat’s ear and fox-and-cubs time to flower, providing an important source of food for species of leafcutter bee. Deciding how long to wait between mowing isn’t an exact science, but can be judged by seeing whether or not the plants in your lawn have had a chance to flower.  “Weed and feeds” are used on lawns in a one-bottle mix of herbicide – used to kill non-grass species that we’d usually consider weeds – and fertiliser, to add nutrients to the soil. Herbicides reduce biodiversity by killing other species, but it may surprise you to learn that fertilisers are no friend to biodiversity either. When gardening or farming, usually the more fertility in the soil the better, because this promotes greater productivity. In other words, more grass, greener grass, more flowers and larger flowers. The selective actions of the gardener or farmer to promote the target species, whether prized rose or crop, means that only the target species benefits.  Without this selectivity, more fertility in your lawn only favours the one or two turf species that are best able to take up nutrients and outcompete other species. So, more fertility means fewer plant species, despite the more luxuriant green colour. Removing the grass clippings after you’ve mowed the lawn also reduces the fertility in your lawn, preventing it from becoming dominated by one or two competitive turf species. Removing and composting grass clippings will gradually remove nutrients from the soil, lowering the fertility with each cut.  Beyond these four steps for improving the value of your lawn to wildlife, there are other things that can be done by the more committed gardener. Leaving small areas of the lawn deliberately uncut – such as strips at the sides or patches in the corners – can help small wildflower meadows to form. Cutting these at the end of summer will prevent them overgrowing into rank grassland with few species.  Wildlife value can also be added by spreading some locally-sourced wildflower seed on your lawn. If you’re gathering seeds from elsewhere, make sure to ask permission and don’t take too much. Wildflower lawns can have a variety of other surprising benefits, not least helping to slow global warming. Some studies have shown that lawns are actually sources of carbon dioxide due to the amount of energy needed to power the mower and manufacture “weed and feeds”. Reducing how often you mow, not applying “weed and feeds” and even using a manual lawn mower can change your lawn from a carbon source to a carbon sink.  Having taller vegetation in your lawn shades the ground, thereby reducing evaporation from the soil and reducing the need for sprinklers and hosepipes. Less mowing means less work to do and more time for you to enjoy watching the bees gathering nectar and pollen from your wildflower lawn.  Wildflower lawns, with spikes of colourful flowers and attendant bees, at least to my eyes, are far prettier than a carpet of grass, whether it’s stripy or not. Grass – especially when not in flower – is the most aesthetically boring part of a grassland. The species that have traditionally been disregarded as “weeds” are far more interesting.

"The conservative International Energy Agency in May warned against governments developing Covid-19 recovery plans that back fossil fuels for fear they’d expose nations to “escalating financial, health and social risks”. The thinking is sound. Unfortunately, governments seem incapable of learning from past catastrophes, or thinking long term and strategically to prepare better for those to come. Covid-19 is very much a dress rehearsal for what awaits us with climate if governments continue to ignore the science, and the policy demands for an effective response.Last summer’s devastating bushfires proved Australians are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. So too are our insurers. As of 23 January the Insurance Council of Australia had tallied 20,000 bushfire-related claims, with insured losses estimated at A$1.65bn.  Climate change carries massive business risks, and acting to reduce emissions is in the best interests of insurance companies. Thermal coal is the biggest single contributor to climate change. Reliable modelling and analysis suggest that at least 90% of existing coal reserves can’t be mined for electricity generation if we are to meet the imperative of a low carbon world by mid-century. Renewable energy is now cheaper and a safer bet for investors. Nineteen of the world’s largest insurance companies have now adopted policies ending or limiting cover for, and investment in, coal projects. As some insurance companies begin to take much-needed responsibility and act on climate change by restricting their involvement in coal projects, insurance brokers, who arrange insurance deals for big corporates, can no longer sit on the fence. Brokers need to lead from the front by refusing to arrange insurance for new coal projects that are fuelling dangerous climate change, such as Adani’s controversial Carmichael mine. Global insurance giant Marsh has a unique opportunity to be a global leader. Marsh has acted as a broker for Adani mining since 2015, helping to facilitate Adani’s controversial Carmichael coal project. Adani’s giant coalmine will help open up the Galilee Basin, one of the largest unexploited coal reserves on Earth, making it impossible to limit warming to 2C. Marsh has been vocal in acknowledging the huge risks climate change poses to the insurance industry. It co-authored the 2020 World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report that highlights the economic and environmental vulnerabilities of not acting to rapidly reduce emissions. Dan Glaser, the president and chief executive officer at Marsh, has publicly spoken about climate change as one of the top risks for the company, particularly in relation to the climate-driven impacts of wildfires and hurricanes and the costs for the insurance industry. Marsh talks the talk when it comes to climate risk but, by working with Adani to help broker insurance for the Carmichael coal project, it is walking us all into a dangerous future. In March, staff bravely raised concerns about their company’s involvement in the project and were told senior US executives were meeting to decide a position on the Carmichael mine and Marsh’s involvement with other coal projects. At their AGM this week, Marsh is expected to announce a new climate policy. By continuing to provide support for new coal projects such as Adani’s, Marsh is not only jeopardising the future of its own business interests and those of its customers, it is also undermining a safe climate for future generations. The insurance industry and global markets are moving away from coal. Westpac recently announced plans to divest from thermal coal by 2030 and 16 major insurers – including Allianz, AXA and Swiss Re – have so far refused to underwrite the Adani Carmichael project. It’s time for brokers like Marsh to join them by ruling out brokering insurance for Adani. Marsh must insure our children’s future against catastrophic climate damage, not a billionaire’s coalmine that will rob future generations of a safe climate and drive up risks for the entire insurance industry. • Dr John Hewson is an honorary professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University, and a former leader of the Liberal party"

American liberals once worshipped at the feet of Lady Justice. During the 1960s, the heyday of the progressive Warren Court, jurists became the tip of the left‐​wing spear. If the public refused to accept the latest progressive nostrum, no worries. Judges would simply impose whatever utopian scheme was in fashion.



All in the name of everything that was good and right, of course. Liberals denied they were distorting the Constitution. They believed that if you checked the penumbras and emanations, as well as interstices and permutations, you could discover hidden meanings that had escaped decades, even centuries, of previous policymakers and judges.



And there was no hidebound commitment to antediluvian precedent. Indeed, for 60s lefties, precedent was an attractive target. Sometimes deservedly: In _Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka_ , a unanimous Supreme Court overturned the wretched _Plessy v. Ferguson_ , the 1896 decision that enshrined “separate but equal,” legitimizing segregation. Decades of practical experience had made clear that separate was anything but equal.



It goes out the window whenever conservatives start influencing the judiciary.



During that era, no one on the left talked about “super precedents” that could never, ever be reconsidered, the way progressives reverently speak of _Roe v. Wade_ today. In those days liberals believed, amazingly, that _bad decisions should be reversed_.



After all, what is the use of treating the high court as a continuing constitutional convention if judges can’t change existing law? It would take all the fun out of being a judicial activist. In fact, a serious commitment to the Constitution requires judges willing to act to enforce limits on state power. For instance, the Fourth Amendment protection against “unreasonable searches and seizures” means nothing if jurists don’t tell the police no. The true test of progressive jurisprudence, however, is torturing the Constitution to confess to what it was never meant to mean.



When conservatives responded to government by judiciary with proposals to limit judges’ jurisdiction, impeach errant jurists, pass constitutional amendments, and more, the Left was horrified. Liberals insisted that judicial independence was the foundation of American liberties. The Founders believed jurists were a bulwark against majoritarian abuses and were bound to enforce the Bill of Rights.



Indeed, progressives could even quote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78: “The independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals.” The Left asked how right‐​leaning activists, who talked incessantly about freedom, could ignore the Constitution’s framers and plot to tear down the very legal order that undergirded American government.



But that was then; this is now.



Who would have imagined that Republicans might elect a president? And might also control the Senate? And then — shock! — appoint conservative judges? Now jurists cannot be counted on to promote the progressive revolution. Worse, the Supreme Court, and increasingly district and circuit courts, are prepared to roll back government overreaching even when Democrats enjoy a legislative majority or control of the regulatory process.



For years, Republicans had only indifferent success in reversing the courts’ leftward swing. The inexorable liberal advance benefited from some truly awful GOP appointments: William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David Souter. Warren Burger and Anthony Kennedy weren’t quite as bad but did significant harm along the way. The Burger Court was less left‐​wing and activist than the Warren Court. And the Rehnquist Court was a bit less left‐​wing in turn. But the Left continued to win plenty of big decisions. The best that could be said was that jurists more often acted as guardians of past activism than promoters of future activism.



But those halcyon liberal years finally are over. President Donald Trump and the Republican Senate formed a powerful partnership and launched a concerted campaign to add jurists who backed a broadly originalist jurisprudence. Judges differed in detail, but the consistent objective was to apply the understanding of the law as it was meant to be, not the fantasy of the law as some wished it to be.



Now the Left has decided that such judges are, well, essentially part of a vast right‐​wing conspiracy. The supposed progressive political majority is prepared to roll, yet these unelected relics of a Constitution written by dead white males are refusing to assist the revolutionary wannabes. Worse, _Trump appointees_ are able to review legislation and regulations, insisting that they conform to legal and constitutional standards. Emma Janger of the People’s Parity Project complained that progressive presidential “attempts to make needed change will simply be blocked by the courts.”



Whoever imagined such a world?? Judges influence policy? _Conservative_ judges influence policy? Do good and decent Americans — excluding the deplorables and their ilk, of course — understand what this means? AlterNet’s Jake Johnson reported, “Progressive advocacy groups and legal experts have warned that these right‐​wing judges will have the power to shape U.S. law on climate, reproductive rights, and other major areas for decades to come.” Shocking! It is not as if liberal judges ever “shaped” policy in these areas. Anyway, this is the 21st century! How can today’s America be so retrograde, anachronistic, even atavistic to allow Republican appointees a say in such vital matters?



This has set off a left‐​wing campaign to eliminate judicial independence. Nothing complicated. Progressive activists just want to seize control of the judiciary by means fair or foul and turn judges into submissive accomplices in ever‐​expanding state power. As Jeffrey Lord observed in _The American Spectator_, “The Left has decided that the judicial branch is to be used as a second, unelected legislative branch to enforce its political choices of the moment.”



The moderate left‐​wing position is to concoct some scheme to ensure “balance” on the high court. Of course, that never was a concern on the left when liberal activists predominated in the judiciary. But such a proposal, if implemented honestly, might diminish political warfare over the courts. Indeed, the best idea, advanced by analysts across the political spectrum, is term limits, which would affect both sides equally.



True progressives, however, have made no pretense of desiring balance. Many advocated formally packing the high court, à la Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Then even Roosevelt’s fellow Democrats balked at destroying the judiciary’s role as a separate branch, costing the president political capital and moral authority. But the Left today hopes the new Democrats won’t let constitutional qualms get in the way of brute politics.



The idea is simple: expand the body’s size and add as many new judges as necessary to ensure a revolutionary outcome. Of course, Republicans could repay the favor if they regained control — which would spur yet another Democratic enlargement. But no problem. Heck, if the court is going to decide policy as if it was a robed legislature, then why not make it as big as a traditional legislature? Even some of the Democratic presidential contenders criticized the idea. So did Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made the obvious point that doing so would make the judiciary look partisan.



Alas, from the Left’s standpoint, there is no guarantee that the Democrats will win the presidency and Senate. Which means truth, justice, and all that is good and right in the universe might not be done after all. And even if the progressive legal equivalent of the Second Coming occurs, what of the meantime? The right‐​wing horsemen of the judicial apocalypse will ride, committing legal mayhem.



Enter Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Commenting on a recent abortion case, he declared: “I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.”



Schumer’s threat was presumably political rather than physical. A prosecution for obstruction of justice seems an overreach. His comments, however, certainly constituted an attack on judicial independence. Yet he was defended by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). The latter denounced criticism by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who, said Whitehouse, was “the architect of an 80‐​case barrage of partisan, 5–4 decisions for big Republican donor interests.” It would be interesting to go back to the 1960s and count how many decisions the Warren Court delivered for Democratic interest groups.



Whitehouse also complained of Sen. Mitch “McConnell’s effort to pack the Court.” As in filling vacant judgeships? How many Republican jurists did presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, and John F. Kennedy appoint? Whitehouse is not upset at GOP court‐​packing, which has not occurred. Rather, he is angry that Republicans are making appointments, and doing so more efficiently than Democrats did in the past.



Imagine if President Richard Nixon called a press conference while the Supreme Court was deliberating over _Roe v. Wade._ Imagine if Nixon, concerned that a majority of justices appeared to have fallen under the influence of the body’s far‐​left flank, declared, “I want to warn you, Blackmun. I want to warn you, Brennan. You are sowing the wind, you risk reaping the whirlwind. You will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with this awful decision.”



He would have been immediately denounced not only by Democrats but also by Republicans. And rightly so.



Even though the threat against the constitutional order then was real, _Roe_ was not constitutional law. Indeed, it was written as a legislative enactment, creating a trimester system for abortions that had not the slightest connection to constitutional or legal principles. As such, the opinion was the epitome of a legislative compromise. And it was widely recognized as such. In the fall of 1976, less than four years after the decision, my liberal constitutional law professor explained that while he would have voted for such an outcome, he could not justify the justices’ legal reasoning.



Nevertheless, jurists are granted lifetime appointments to ensure their independence, freeing them to rule against legislators and presidents. That is frustrating, irritating, even maddening when one ends up on the losing side of a case. But such insulation is essential to the constitutional system of limited government and individual liberty.



After _Roe_ , conservatives complained about lack of judicial accountability, often in terms similar to those used by the Left today. But none, at least that I remember, ominously threatened that errant jurists would “pay the price” and not “know what hit” them. The question was how to overturn the decision, not how to cow the justices.



Progressives appear to feel no such limitation. After all, the Left is not interested in sharing the judiciary. Imagine a legal Brezhnev Doctrine: what’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable. Most judges usually were Democrats, though an occasional appointment might be allowed Republicans. Just never enough to make a meaningful difference.



Having found that it now has to share not just the judiciary but also control of the judiciary, the Left wants to change the rules. Brian Fallon of Demand Justice said, “Democrats cannot sit back and accept the status quo of a partisan Republican five‐​seat majority for the next 30 years.” After all, Democrats enjoyed at least loose control for 30 years. Yet progressives now act as if they only just noticed that unelected judges interfere with democratic decisions. Who knew?! So jurists must be pushed aside, marginalized, and placed under legislative control.



Schumer has inadvertently provided what could be called a “teachable moment.” Republicans should note how Democrats once defended judicial independence and how the Founders realized that the judicial branch should balance the executive and legislative branches. No political party or partisan movement is entitled to make the judiciary its own. Yet Democrats now are acting in ways that would never be accepted for Republicans. Schumer and his colleagues should be called to account.



Indeed, the GOP should seize the opportunity to encourage bipartisan reform. If neither side likes absolute, life‐​time independence, there are alternatives. One possibility would be easing requirements for amending the Constitution. Getting a two‐​thirds vote of Congress and three‐​quarters vote of state legislators or calling a constitutional convention is difficult, perhaps too difficult. This encourages frustrated activists to turn to judges to make changes. Simplifying the procedure might help move constitutional amendments back to normal politics.Another measure would be set limited terms for federal judges. The details don’t matter too much. Terms could be medium or long. Jurists might be eligible for reappointment. The essential point would be to end lifetime immunity while preserving legal independence. Terms also would provide for rotation, spreading out appointments. Nominations for a set term rather than for a lifetime would reduce the two parties’ stakes, lessening pressure to turn confirmation battles into political Armageddon.



Equally important, neither measure would bias judicial outcomes while addressing legitimate issues. In essence, such an approach would ensure that the judiciary is shared equitably rather than turned into a weapon for one side or the other.



Ultimately, politicians should stop asking judges to make policy decisions. Cases should be about law rather than politics. Otherwise depoliticizing the judges’ role is merely second best. Whatever is done, however, should leave the judiciary as an independent branch, free — indeed, duty‐​bound — to check the executive and legislature. Protecting Americans’ liberties requires no less.

"Alan Jones breached broadcasting codes for decency in his use of “violent metaphors” about New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and accuracy in his comments about climate change, the media watchdog has found days before the shock-jock retires after a 35-year career. The Australian Communications and Media Authority ordered the 79-year-old to make an on-air correction about the climate change comments but found he has already apologised for his criticism of Ardern. Jones said on air on Thursday morning that he had incorrectly asserted that biomass is a fossil fuel. The Acma found he presented figures relating to Australia and New Zealand’s percentage of energy use from solar and wind that were incorrect. The now infamous August 2019 broadcast – which led to an unprecedented advertiser boycott – attracted more than 125 complaints and was found to have “offended against generally accepted community standards of decency”. The offensive statements included: “I just wonder whether Scott Morrison’s going to be fully briefed to shove a sock down her throat”, “Now I hope Scott Morrison gets tough here with a few backhanders”, and “I hope he goes for the throat this morning.” Jones is retiring just one year into a two-year $8m contract with Nine Radio after an advertiser boycott stripped 50% of the show’s revenue and caused the entire network to suffer. His advertisers were targeted by social media activists Sleeping Giants and Mad Fucking Witches after the Ardern comments last year. The Acma chair Nerida O’Loughlin said the comments were not appropriate for public radio broadcasting in today’s Australia. “The repeated use of violent metaphors by Mr Jones and his apparent encouragement of aggressive silencing of Ms Ardern was highly offensive and did not meet contemporary community expectations,” O’Loughlin said. “This was evident in the public display of outrage from the community, actions by advertisers and actions by then chairman of Macquarie Media who publicly stated any recurrence of this type of comment would result in the termination of Mr Jones’ contract.” Because Jones made an on-air and a written apology and received counselling from management, no further action was taken on the decency breaches. “Given the imminent retirement of Mr Jones from 2GB and the actions taken by Macquarie Media and Mr Jones at the time, the Acma is not taking further action against the licensee for breach of the decency rules,” O’Loughlin said. Jones did not use like-for-like data in his statements about climate change policy, the authority found, in contravention of the industry code which requires broadcasters to “use reasonable efforts to ensure the facts they are presenting are accurate”. “The factual error and inconsistent information were used to incorrectly portray that Australia generates more of its energy from renewables than New Zealand,” O’Loughlin said. His retirement comes nine months after the station’s management said Jones was on his final warning for offensive comments and took the unprecedented step of scolding him publicly. Despite dominating breakfast radio in Sydney for 35 years, recording an unequalled 226 survey wins, his conduct on air has led to the radio station losing advertisers and haemorrhaging revenue. The incident will be used in staff training at 2GB, the authority said."
"**A ""high proportion"" of planned operations at a city hospital have been cancelled due to record numbers of coronavirus patients.**
The NHS trust which runs Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI) has told board members it is under ""significant pressure"".
Chief executive Robert Woolley added: ""We are in excess of the first wave, without doubt.""
Only urgent treatment is going ahead such as cancer surgery, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Mr Woolley, of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (UHBT) said pressure on critical care facilities and ward beds had led to cancellations.
""We are making every effort to make as much elective planned care as we can but it is true that we are seeing a higher proportion of cancellations of surgery than we would like.
""We have very little in the way of lower priority elective care going on, particularly at the BRI.
""We are maintaining as much of the high-priority elective surgery, particular cancer surgery, as we can,"" he added.
The Nightingale Bristol hospital is being used for children's day case and outpatient procedures and the trust is also commissioning 300 community beds to help discharge patients more effectively.
Mr Woolley also said that the trust has increased the number of patients assigned to each nurse in general wards from six to 10 during the day.
The new ratio, which applies at the BRI and Weston General Hospital, has gone up during night shifts from eight to 12.
The chief executive reassured board members that it is was not a permanent measure and was introduced so that more nurses could care for coronavirus patients on ventilators.
""I know that has created some concern across the trust but it has been done as a very temporary measure in a very considered way, taking account of the balance of safety risks for patients and staff right across the trust,"" he added.

You really need to understand the anti-car attitude that this government has got. We really do need to be concerned about this. While I have nothing against electric cars in principle, acknowledging that they will work well for some people, clearly they will not work for everyone. They simply do not have the range, the power or the towing capacity to replace every other vehicle on the road. 



I cannot see a problem with making them available for those that want them, although I am absolutely against them being subsidised by taxpayers. I envisage that, in a few years time, there will be quite a few electric vehicles on our roads, and so long as everyone who wants to drive a non-electric vehicle still has the choice to do so, then I have no problem with them. 



Our government has a different view, however, and is anxious to take away any choice in the matter. Once again, practicality takes second place to ideology, as this hopeless government once again tries to take away all options, except one.



Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter ordered an investigation into a total ban on petrol car imports by 2035 among a range of options to reduce emissions in the national transport fleet.



An array of documents, including an excerpt from a draft cabinet paper from April last year, reveal Genter instructed officials to work on the policy, before scrapping the plan.



Thankfully, this government will be nowhere near power by 2035, but that is hardly the point. Once again, ideology rides roughshod over reality, and we could have been in real trouble because of this bunch of idealistic idiots.



A Ministry of Transport (MoT) report from September last year showed officials had been instructed to “progress an initiative to regulate an end-date of 2035 to the import of light vehicles that are unable to be driven without fossil-fuels”.



 **In other words, Genter wanted to ban the import of all cars which still use petrol by 2035.**



This was an idea first floated by the independent Productivity Commission, Genter said.



“It’s normal for officials to investigate and recommend a wide range of options to ministers,” she told the Herald in a statement.



Maybe, but to ban cars that are powered by fossil fuels even though there is quite simply no way that electric vehicles will be sufficiently advanced to replace all cars, utes, vans and trucks by that time is madness.



Then there is the small but somewhat inconvenient fact that the national grid will simply never cope with the extra load required if everyone suddenly started driving electric cars. And why not? Because the Greens will not allow any new dams to be built.





But, due to the “lack of information, time and resources”, the cost-benefit analysis was not able to take a number of key issues into consideration.



For example, how such a ban would affect EVs was not looked into, nor was the impacts on electricity prices and the road safety impacts of changing New Zealand’s vehicle fleet so dramatically.



The report said the main benefit for consumers would be the saving people would make when it comes to not having to buy petrol.



Fantastic… but then there is the very small question of replacing the battery on the EV every 5 years or so, at an approximate cost of $30,000 each time. Nobody is saving anything by doing this. We are all being taken for fools.



Genter’s proposal was never taken to Cabinet – “it was rejected and ruled out”. 



National transport spokesman Chris Bishop said **the fact a cabinet paper was produced showed she was working behind closed doors to change the law.**



  
“Reducing emissions from our vehicle fleet is an important step in the fight against climate change.  
“But it would be irresponsible to make petrol cars illegal so soon without a solid plan to help people into electric vehicles,” he said.



  
We all know how Julie Anne Genter likes to work in secret, even though she is part of our ‘open and transparent government. Her letter to Phil Twyford about Wellington’s transport woes still has not been released, and she is dying in a ditch to keep it that way. And now this.



Chris Bishop is my local MP, and I have a lot of respect for him, but I disagree with him over this. Electric vehicles will never be a ‘one size fits all,’ and it is all very well to say that they reduce emissions, but that completely ignores their carbon footprint during the manufacturing stage, not to mention the disposal of batteries. That will be the next ecological headache that no one seems to have foreseen.



I am all for being given choices. If someone wants to buy an EV, let them do it, but let them pay the full price, without taxpayer subsidies. But for a government that is completely ideologically driven, and which is completely blinkered in their view of the world, this is a dangerous precedent. Okay, the plan may have been scrapped… this time. How long will it be before it rears its ugly head again?



Remember, this is from an associate minister of transport who calls people who want to drive – presumably including driving EVs – ‘car fascists’. That tells you all you need to know.

In the above interview, Julie Anne Genter (to use a vulgar phrase) got her arse handed to her by the very polite Peter Williams. She was asked about points made in Troy Bowker’s [NZ Herald article](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/nz-herald-tells-the-truth/) and her response was that it was fake news and that it is just the fossil fuel industry spreading misinformation. No doubt Bowker will respond to her accusations in a second article which I look forward to reading.



In the interview Genter spoke almost continuously and seemed to think that if she talked fast enough people wouldn’t notice that she didn’t answer the question or that what she was saying wasn’t true.



She deflected, distracted and talked and talked until finally, she had had enough of the hard questions and used the excuse that she had to go to another meeting and very abruptly hung up. 



She didn’t answer any of the questions put to her properly. She tried the fake news claim and said that Troy was part of the fossil fuel industry. She tried to claim when challenged about cobalt being mined by child labour for batteries that cobalt was not part of all batteries, that its in other things and, that of course, New Zealand follows UN guidelines on child labour. It was hard to believe that claim since in the same breath she was also claiming without evidence that our railways are profitable! It is claims like that one that reminds us that she is an American import since any born and bred Kiwi would know that our railways have never ever been profitable.



Another stand out from the interview was her statement that the ministry for the environment is looking at recycling the waste. **In other words, they don’t have a solution.** She also claimed that the Climate emergency is real and we have to act now because in 10 – 12 years it will be too late. Someone needs to remind her that most of the world believed that the world was flat… until they didn’t.

Overseas, Jacinda is still seen as some kind of Madonna… one who bore a child, donned a hijab and hugged a few people… but no one seems to understand that this is all pretty basic stuff. Anyone can do that. Jacinda is naturally empathetic, but that does not make her a great leader, any more than Greta Thunberg’s belief that she can see carbon dioxide makes her a climate change expert. Darling Greta needs to go back to school, and darling Jacinda needs to focus on the job we all pay her very handsomely for.



Mike Hosking is onto it.



The rumours are rife that our Prime Minister is actually in the country this week and looking to attend to domestic matters – and she’s got a bit on her plate.



And because Jacinda Ardern’s plate is getting more and more full, what you are seeing increasingly is the sad reality that a reputation has been formed, and is starting to cement in place. That is of a leader that isn’t exactly hands-on, across the brief, decisive, or omnipresent.



This is a Government that’s drifting.



What did anyone expect from a prime minister who openly stated that she didn’t want the job, and who is clearly totally out of her depth now that she is in it?



The “part-time Prime Minister”, who loves nothing more than to talk, consult, yak, discuss, whiteboard, or blue sky anything but actually make a decision is now facing a real issue with the public. Her personal popularity is significantly down, the gloss is wearing thin, if not off.



Some things she might like to actually address:



The Ihum&amacrtao land occupation she’s insisted on involving herself in, despite her saying over and over it’s got nothing to do with government. 



• The public housing crisis. Numbers last week setting another record.  
• DHB debt, as of last week it has [blown out to hundreds of millions](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255017).  
• Oranga Tamariki [baby snatching allegations](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12254170) and her department under siege.  
• Last week’s confidence surveys numbers. Still falling, [business at decade-long lows](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12246059).  
• The JobSeeker benefit numbers two weeks back. Once again at record numbers.  
• Where is the KiwiBuild reset?  
• Where is the [National Cancer Agency they promised](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255527) and yet were beaten to by National last week? 



Yep. All fair comment. Today, with her proposed Abortion Bill, she is more interested in killing Kiwis than saving their lives.



Two years in, why is so little actually being done? And given that, isn’t three out of four weeks overseas **(having told me she is well aware people don’t like her being out of the country hence she**[ **didn’t do a thing about D-Day**](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12238853) **)** isn’t it just about time a few things get ticked off? 



I wish I could answer that, Mike, but I think having a completely incompetent government would probably cover it, coupled with a completely incompetent prime minister who is clearly totally out of her depth. Oops… am I being ‘disrespectful’ here?



Reputations are hard won, but easily damaged. She’s damaging hers, she only has so much goodwill. She only has so much fairy dust.



And with a year to a general election, increasing numbers of voters will start to tune in, pay attention, and expect results. Results get votes, so she might want to actually look at a few things in the in-tray.



Well Mike, I think the hashtag _#parttimePM_ has gained some traction. You referred to it, and now it is becoming mainstream. No prime minister in recent decades has been accused of anything like it.



Jacinda might be a superhero overseas, but back home, we are starting to see through the facade. But then again, as we all know… fairy dust has a very limited shelf life, and Jacinda has nothing else to offer and I think she knows it. That is why she tries very hard to never be here.

By S. Fred Singer
Gallia omnia est divisa in partes tres.  This phrase from Julius Gaius Caesar about the division of Gaul nicely illustrates the universe of climate scientists — also divided into three parts.  On the one side are the “warmistas,” with fixed views about apocalyptic man-made global warming; at the other extreme are the “deniers.”  Somewhere in the middle are climate skeptics.
In principle, every true scientist must be a skeptic.  That’s how we’re trained; we question experiments, and we question theories.  We try to repeat or independently derive what we read in publications — just to make sure that no mistakes have been made.
In my view, warmistas and deniers are very similar in some respects — at least their extremists are.  
They have fixed ideas about climate, its change, and its cause.  They both ignore “inconvenient truths” and select data and facts that support their preconceived views.  Many of them are also quite intolerant and unwilling to discuss or debate these views — and quite willing to think the worst of their opponents.
Of course, these three categories do not have sharp boundaries; there are gradations.  For example, many skeptics go along with the general conclusion of the warmistas but simply claim that the human contribution is not as large as indicated by climate models.  But at the same time, they join with deniers in opposing drastic efforts to mitigate greenhouse (GH) gas emissions.
I am going to resist the temptation to name names.  But everyone working in the field knows who is a warmista, skeptic, or denier.  The warmistas, generally speaking, populate the U.N.’s IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and subscribe to its conclusion that most of the temperature increase of the last century is due to carbon-dioxide emissions produced by the use of fossil fuels.  At any rate, this is the conclusion of the most recent IPCC report, the fourth in a series, published in 2007.  Since I am an Expert Reviewer of IPCC, I’ve had an opportunity to review part of the 5th Assessment Report, due in 2013.  Without revealing deep secrets, I can say that the AR5 uses essentially the same argument and evidence as AR4 — so let me discuss this “evidence” in some detail.

"As the climate crisis is increasingly felt across the globe, protesters take to the streets and politicians scrabble to respond, a crucial question is beginning to emerge. How can governments develop climate strategies which build public support for action? An announcement by six UK parliamentary committees that they will hold a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency is a crucial step toward answering that question. There are no shortage of prescriptions for climate action. From economists calling for an economy-wide carbon tax, to scientists advocating “earth system governance” at the planetary level, there are experts assuring us that they have strategies to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly and effectively. But there’s a dangerous illusion sitting behind these prescriptions – what the social scientist Maarten Hajer called the illusion of “cockpitism”. Cockpitism describes the assumption that you can dictate climate solutions the same way a pilot might fly a plane, sitting in the cockpit charting the most efficient course, with perfectly calibrated instruments and levers. This illusion is very problematic – and not just because the climate system is an entity far more complex than a plane. It is problematic because it cuts people out. It is a seemingly apolitical view that self-defined “experts” can decide what is best for people and impose those solutions. At its most extreme, it suggests that democracy is the problem, not the solution – as veteran earth scientist James Lovelock once said, “climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while.” My own research suggests that the opposite is true. To tackle the climate crisis, we need more, and better, democracy, not less. My interviews with politicians showed that they were convinced of the need for action on climate, but did not know what support there would be from the electorate. As one told me: “I’ve had tens of thousands of conversations with voters, and I just don’t have conversations about climate change.”  But this may be about to change, as we know from polling data that generalised concern about climate change is now at an all-time high. Yet how does this translate into support for far-reaching climate action? Would people be more likely to support locally based programmes, with powers given to cities and towns to cut emissions? Would there be support for introducing a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, over the next decade? Would people support higher taxes on carbon, if the money was invested in low-carbon solutions and support for vulnerable households? And crucially, how could this all link together into a credible, effective climate strategy that would build the mandate for further action toward a net-zero carbon target? This is where processes such as a citizens’ assembly, or other deliberative processes such as citizens’ juries or deliberative workshops, can help. These processes allow a representative group of citizens to meet with experts on equal terms, assess evidence, debate and suggest solutions. They are not a substitute for electoral politics, but they provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of voters’ viewpoints than traditional political polling or focus groups.  At the recent Citizens’ Assembly on climate change held in Ireland, citizens offered up a surprisingly radical and confident set of suggestions, most of which the government is now taking forward. In the UK, many local areas are now setting up deliberative processes to decide their own next steps on climate. Done well, such processes can help to develop a more inclusive, less divisive politics, countering the distrust of “experts” and allowing a constant interplay between the views and values of the public and politicians. A citizens’ assembly is not a panacea. Deliberation won’t, in and of itself, solve the problem. We need far-reaching action which will require radical policy and confrontation of vested interests. But this policy and action will only be achievable if people understand and support it. The more we find out about how to build a public mandate for climate action, and the more we include people in genuine debate and deliberation, the more likely we are to find a way through the climate crisis. If it’s not democratic, it’s not realistic. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Harvey. Irma. Maria. Michael. Four strong (category 3 or higher) hurricanes in 14 months. Something is happening, right?   
  
When category 4 hurricane Harvey banged into Rockport, Texas, and then decided to hang around for five days visiting the fine folks of Houston and vicinity, it broke the 11.8 year “hurricane drought”, by far the longest period in the record without a major (category 3 or higher) landfall.[1],[2] Because of its unfortunate stall, Harvey also broke the record for a single-storm rainfall in the U.S., with 60.58 inches at Nederland, Texas.   
  
What about a human influence from dreaded carbon dioxide? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) dryly stated on September 20:   




In the Atlantic, it is premature to conclude that human activities–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on hurricane activity.



This was from a GFDL publication “Global Warming and Hurricanes”. This is a frequently revised publication designed to keep readers current with the evolving scientific literature on the subject, but the statement about prematurity has been in the document for many years.   
  
But wait. Everything else being equal,[3] (“EEBE”) hurricanes—and their generic name, tropical cyclones—acquire their energy from warm water, and, globally, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are around 0.5°C warmer than they were when the data become reliable around 1880. There was a decline of around 0.3°C from then to the low point in the record, around 1910, which means from bottom to top (1910 to 2016) there’s a change of around 0.8°C for the past 100 years or so.   
  
There’s usually not enough energy to fuel a tropical cyclone if the ocean’s upper layer temperature is less than 26.5°C which limits their “seasons” to the late summer and early fall in each hemisphere, with the exception of the western Pacific, where there’s enough warm water to spin up storms year-round, although the maximum occurs at nearly the same time as it does in the North Atlantic. Owing to climatologically cooler temperatures, there are very few tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic.   
  
Beyond the threshold, increasing the oceanic heat content (i.e. the vertically integrated temperature) should, EEBE, increase either the number of storms (holding their power constant), or their power (holding the number constant).   
  
Meteorology wizard (and Cato adjunct scholar) Ryan Maue’s relatively recent PhD from Florida State was squarely over the bridge between tropical and temperate-zone storm climatology. Ryan knows hurricanes, and, beginning in grad school, has generated the comprehensive history of global tropical cyclone power. Although some tropical cyclones occur in pretty remote places, the onset of global weather satellite coverage in 1970 means his record is largely complete   
  
Obviously EE is not E. Despite an SST rise of nearly 0.5°C since 1970 and a global surface temperature rise of around 0.65°C[4], there’s simply no warming-related trend in tropical cyclone power:   






_Figure 1. Maue’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index shows no changes that can be related to overall temperature trends since 1970. Figures are 24-month moving averages. The top circles are for the globe, and the bottom ones for the Northern Hemisphere. If you’re paying attention, the space between the two gives the ACE index for the Southern Hemisphere._   
  
As Roy Spencer (www.drroyspencer.com) recently has shown, there’s been a decline in the number of category 3 or higher storms hitting the coterminous US.   






_Figure 2. Roy Spencer’s plot of major (category 3 or higher) hurricanes hitting the lower-48 states. Note that there’s still two years to go for the decade beginning in 2011. There certainly could be more by 2020; if we take the historical average frequency of major hurricane hits and add that in, there’s nearly a 50-50 chance that the actual number will be four instead of three. Does not include two strikes in Puerto Rico (Cat 4 Maria last year and Cat 3 Hugo in 1989)._   
  
**Historical Perspectives**   
  
The 2014 “National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the United States” made a big deal out of a seemingly large increase in the hurricane Power Dissipation Index. The principal difference between it and Maue’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy index is the PDI uses the cube of the wind speed while the ACE index uses the square. The National Assessment highlighted a rise from 1980 through 2009. But the authors certainly had data through 2013 at their disposal.   
  
There is also is another record of Atlantic hurricanes back to 1851, called HURDAT and put together by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division. Prior to satellites (pre-1970) and aircraft reconnaissance (beginning in World War II), it would likely to have missed some storms, but HURDAT is about a complete a record as can be generated. Further, any errors in it are likely to be omissions of storms rather than calling ones that actually didn’t exist.   
  
Ryan Maue used HURDAT and calculated the PDI back to 1920, and his analysis shows that the 2014 National Assessment picked a rather prominent cherry when it decided to emphasize the 1980-2009 rise.   






_Figure 3. North Atlantic hurricane Power Dissipation Index (PDI). Despite being published in 2014, the most recent National Assessment emphasized the period 1980-2009, displaying an upward trend line during that time. It’s quite clear that the increase from the 40s to the early 60s is quite similar to what was displayed in the Assessment._   
  
Roy Spencer recently looked at the frequency and windspeed of landfalling Category 3 or higher storms striking Florida. There’s obviously no trend, either in intensity or in frequency.   






_Figure 4. Category 3 strikes in Florida since 1900, along with highest sustained winds. Maximum gust speeds are higher. Category 3 hurricane Matthew in 2016 is not listed as the center never crossed the coast—but the Cape Canaveral area was very close to the western eyewall, and experienced considerable damage._   
  
**Hurricane Damages**   
  
Colorado State’s Phil Klotzbach and three co-authors recently published what should be the last word on U.S. hurricane frequency and damages. One of the co-authors was University of Colorado’s Roger Pielke, Jr., who contributed a plot of what he calls “normalized hurricane damage”, which essentially projects current property values onto past hurricanes.   
  
Again, there is no significant trend. 2017 had the third-highest normalized damage total in the continental US (note that does not include Puerto Rico), around $130 billion. That pales, compared to 1926, when total damages would have been around $230 billion for today’s property values.   






All in all, recent hurricane activity isn’t particularly remarkable. Following a record 11.8-year major hurricane drought, recent activity is surely impressive, but imparts no overall trend when viewed in terms of the entire record since 1900. Further, Maue’s global accumulated cyclone energy, going back to 1970 (the start of global weather satellite coverage), shows no relationship to global surface temperature. 2018 appears to be a record for activity (not number) in one basin—the Eastern North Pacific, but, again, that isn’t going to impart a trend.

"**Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said.**
Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Robert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"".
Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added.
Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules.
The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday.
Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business.
The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday.
""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote.
""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport.""
Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times.
But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"".
""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC.
""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions.
But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.
Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest.
Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer.
Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently that it was cutting 3,500 jobs with the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters.
In August, M&S announced it was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months."

One positive outcome of the recession, as the states struggle to find revenue to spend, is that state subsidies to businesses are facing increased scrutiny.   
  
This week the _New York Times_ reported that states are looking at reducing or ending programs that hand out taxpayer money to television and movie producers. In Pennsylvania, some last-minute handouts from outgoing governor Ed Rendell are under fire, including a $10 million state grant to rehabilitate a former Sony plant for new tenants. According to the Commonwealth Foundation’s Nate Benefield, this is the _fourth_ time Pennsylvania taxpayers have subsidized the site: 



Sony moved out in 2007, despite getting more than $40 million in corporate welfare under Gov. Robert P. Casey to come to Pennsylvania, then another $1 million grant under Rendell to stay in the state—a mere two years before shutting down its plant.   
  
Before Sony, the site was occupied by Volkswagen, which got $70 million in state aid in the 1970s under Gov. Milton Shapp. This was touted as a great success -- until Volkswagen moved out in 1987, after 10 years of operation.   
  
Pennsylvania is merely renting jobs with this “economic development” spending, burdening other businesses with higher taxes. Hopefully, Gov. Tom Corbett can learn from the failed policies of the past and work on improving the state's economic climate rather than trying to pick winners.



New Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett could learn a lesson from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, which received another black eye this week. I’ve written previously on problems with the IEDC, which is the state’s corporate welfare arm. As a former budget official with the State of Indiana, I can attest that the IEDC’s string of embarrassments is as unsurprising as it is appalling.   
  
On Tuesday, investigative report Bob Segall of WTHR-TV in Indianapolis released the latest in a series of reports on the IEDC’s exaggerated job creation claims. (Intrepid journalists take note: Bob and his team just received a prestigious Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for their investigatory work on the IEDC.)   
  
Bob took the findings of a recent audit and ascertained that Indiana governor Mitch Daniels and the IEDC haven’t been giving Hoosiers the full story.   
  
From the report: 



The “Summary of Incentive Program Review” prepared by audit firm Crowe Horwath examined 597 job-creation projects outlined in IEDC annual reports from 2005 to 2009. The projects were listed as ""Indiana Economic Successes"" that would bring new jobs to Indiana.   
  
According to the report, those projects were expected to create 44,208 jobs by late 2010 and, based on the most recent information available to auditors, have so far resulted in 37,640 actual jobs — a realization rate of 85%.   
  
But the state's job realization rate is actually much lower than 85%, according to additional data reviewed by WTHR.   
  
The numbers cited above are based solely on data for ""reporting companies,"" and they do not include job data for 200 other projects also listed as ""Indiana Economic Successes"" in IEDC annual reports. Including those projects, as well, the number of newly-created jobs the agency had anticipated to materialize by the end of 2010 is 57,088 (not 44,208), according to the report. Using that figure, IEDC's job realization rate is 66%.   
  
And nowhere does the audit report mention the 98,683 total new job commitments announced by IEDC from 2005 to 2009. Using that number — which IEDC and the governor have repeatedly promoted in their press releases, speeches and annual reports – the audit data suggests, so far, only 38% of jobs announced by IEDC have resulted in actual jobs. While that percentage is expected to increase in coming years (some of the companies are not expected to fulfill all of their job commitments for several more years), the overall numbers show IEDC's real job realization statistics are much lower than the agency portrays to the public by citing far more limited data.



Two words in this selection from the report stand out: “press releases.” My observations of the IEDC from within the Daniels administration led me to coin the phrase “press release economics” to describe what Indiana government officials were really practicing.   
  
Programs that hand out taxpayer money to businesses to lure or retain jobs are popular with state politicians, and Governor Daniels is no different. Better policies, like cutting business taxes across the board, require a willingness to expend substantial political capital without an immediate payoff. (I recently read that Daniels would sign a cut in the state’s high corporate tax rate if a proposal in the state legislature makes it to his desk. Daniels had turned down the idea of cutting the corporate rate while I was there, so the change of heart is curious but nonetheless welcome.)   
  
Targeted business subsidies, on the other hand, are cheaper and generate immediate, favorable press. Unfortunately, this form of central planning is unsound as it merely transfers economic resources from taxpayers – including businesses – to businesses favored by government officials. And because government officials are inherently inferior to the market when it comes to directing economic activity, the results are far from ideal – and often downright counterproductive.

"At the time of writing, it is 77 days since Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, mentioned climate change in his official transcripts. The last mention came at the tail end of Australia’s disastrous Black Summer bushfires when Morrison declared that his government will not be adopting a “net zero by 2050” target, in favour of a “technology roadmap”. Since that moment, the world has changed. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to a frighteningly infectious new virus. And as countries around the world begin to toy with the thought of recovery, there are increasing efforts to ensure our climb out of the hole comes paired with a permanent shift towards a deeper decoupling from our current heavy reliance on fossil fuels.  The pandemic is changing us, but not all of us. After climate-intensified bushfires tore through Australia, the government’s position on climate remained utterly unchanged, as did the opposition party’s support for the large-scale extraction and sale of fossil fuels. The pandemic, and the opportunity that recovery brings for wholesale reimagination of our relationship with energy has landed with a dull, unceremonious thud. It is a stark reminder of what we need to do to bring about true change within one of the planet’s most carbon-intensive countries. For several months now, Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has been insisting on a “tech, not taxes” approach to climate policy. This shuns concepts like net zero targets, and opts instead for the incentivisation of technological advancements (using money acquired through taxation, strangely enough). To help develop this philosophy, Taylor opted to hold a secretive review of the government’s emissions reduction fund (ERF) policy, in which public money is handed to projects that suck carbon out of the air, alongside the establishment of “baselines” for high emitters. It was helmed by former head of Origin Energy Grant King, who is also former director of Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Ltd (Appea) and BHP Billiton. The King review puts forward a range of tweaks to the ERF that seem likely to create far more problems than they solve. Historically, baselines have been weak and flexible, meaning large emitters simply chug along as normal without consequence. The new policy proposals include the prospect of tradable rewards for those that have emissions well underneath their baselines. But if those baselines are set ludicrously high already, this might simply become a conduit for taxpayer funding for high emitters. The prioritisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which stores emissions before they are released into the atmosphere, is where things go from potentially problematic to verifiably disastrous. The review suggests two major agencies – the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena, a former employer of mine) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) – change their remit so they can fund CCS (normally excluded due to the fact it is not zero emissions). This is in addition to opening up the ERF for potentially funding CCS projects too. “Technology neutral” is the plea here, but this phrase has always been an infuriating euphemism for “can we just ignore emissions, please?” The King review and Taylor’s response to it are not neutral: these are active efforts to shift focus away from cheap, effective emissions reductions and towards expensive, ineffective emissions reductions. Carbon capture and storage is the preferred vehicle for perpetual climate delay. It is an eternal gravity well for public money with nearly nothing to show for it. To invest heavily in this instead of working towards fully decarbonising electricity and transport is like eating a crab with a gold-plated baby spoon, and then shrugging with feigned surprise as you stab pointlessly at the shell. CCS is not “low emissions”. Those insufficient emissions reductions come at an incredible cost, even when emissions reductions from wind and solar are becoming ludicrously cheap. “The only way CCS on coal will ever be built at scale is with a carbon price so high it’d kill the rest of the coal sector,” wrote energy expert Simon Holmes à Court.  The prospects for CCS are so dire that Australia’s coal lobby, the Minerals Council of Australia, ended up taking the funds it set aside for CCS research (“Coal21”) and redirected them to an advertising campaign for coal. CCS may have some niche applications, but to be put forward as the main show for climate action is a clear plan for intentional failure. To be funding it instead of integrating new wind and solar and leaving fossil fuel fuels in the ground is to loudly declare an intent to delay climate action as long as possible. As I wrote here, this has been happening for a while. Leaked notes from a 2004 government meeting with the fossil fuel industry declare that: [The prime minister] advised that he had interest in government and companies addressing the issues together in the establishment of a low emissions energy fund. This would be focused on accelerating Super Dooper (his words) technology progress aimed at significantly reducing emissions.” The fossil fuels industry was wringing its hands about the effectiveness of wind and solar and urging the blocking of any policy supporting them, while pleading for cash injections for CCS. In fact, John Howard’s original clean energy target scheme, put forward in 2007, included CCS in its subsidy remit. I don’t want to be writing this article again in 2034. As this debate about technology and recovery plays out, the government will no doubt reactivate its dog-eared, well-worn lines about strong climate action being toxic for the economy and jobs. There is a simple way to break this infinite loop of industry sabotage and government malfeasance, and to shatter the tactic of using ineffective technology as a conduit for eternal inaction. Climate action that brings both immediate benefits and long-term benefits is the key, here. We know, with confidence, which technologies are duds, and which are likely to serve as the workhorses of climate action. But the pandemic is highlighting that broader factors like justice, equity and fairness are on our minds, at a time of stress and economic pressure. We know that climate action is beneficial for human life even when you exclude the impacts of reduced emissions on the Earth’s atmospheric and ocean systems. The air is cleaner, the power is cheaper and more democratised, the transport is more accessible, and business and investment work better. Good climate action won’t happen until the infinite loop is broken. We know that we can’t wait for the next crisis – and there will be many, in the coming years – to snap those locked into inaction out of their stupor. We must build a better case for the immediate curative power of climate action. • Ketan Joshi is a freelance writer specialising in climate and energy, formerly having worked for private and government (including the Arena) clean energy organisations in Australia.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."
"“The political moment is now” to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade.  Old passenger jets also need to be rapidly retired or cheap oil prices will encourage budget airlines to run services almost empty, which could push up emissions even if passenger numbers stay low, they say. As did banks after the 2008-9 financial crisis, many aviation companies are appealing for government support to escape from a problem they partly caused. The expansion of flight networks, packed seating and a reluctance to accept quarantine measures have contributed to the rapid transmission of the Covid-19 virus across the globe. Until the pandemic, governments were so focused on keeping airlines globally competitive that they largely gave the sector a free ride in terms of emissions cuts and contributions to public revenues. Aviation fuel is completely untaxed in most countries. But the crisis has weakened airline claims that they should be treated as profit-seeking independent companies rather than public entities with social responsibilities. Thousands of planes have been grounded for two months. Even if the lockdown is lifted soon, the industry expects revenues to halve this year. Many airlines are now begging for taxpayer support. European governments have agreed €12.7bn (£11.35bn) in bailouts, with another €17.1bn under discussion, according to a tracker compiled by Carbon Market Watch, Greenpeace and Transport & Environment. The US approved $25bn (£20.6bn) support for the industry in April. If public funds are used to save companies, there is a growing argument that society should get something in return in terms of environmental improvements. Hopes were raised when the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Air France would have to become “the greenest airline in the world” in return for a €7bn bailout. This meant reducing the carbon intensity of their overall operations by 50% by 2030, cutting absolute emissions within France by half by 2030, using 2% renewable jet fuel by 2024 and drastically reducing the number of flights of less than 2hr 30mins duration that compete with rail services. Although these conditions are currently non-binding, campaigners said they were hopeful they will be supported by new laws in the coming years. Andrew Murphy, an aviation policy officer at the NGO Transport & Environment, said this could be a turning point after decades of inaction. “Before the Covid crisis, aviation emissions were going in the wrong direction. This is a moment that has shaken up the industry and raised questions about subsidies, tax breaks, and frequent flying. It is an opportunity for governments to think how they support the airline industry.” He said he was also encouraged the UK has not yet committed public funds to bail out airlines, which would gives them the incentive to put planes back in the sky too soon. A more important step, he said, would be for government to include aviation emissions in their climate targets. “It’s not sexy, but it’s very important,” he said. “Without this, nations’ climate calculations are based on dodgy accounting, as Greta [Thunberg] pointed out when she was in the UK last year.” Some environmentalists such as George Monbiot argue airlines should not be rescued. This is echoed by Extinction Rebellion. “With 90% of UK planes grounded, and knowing we need to halt polluting industries, there can be no justification for the government to financially support restarting flights. Let’s embed this change rather than bail out this destructive industry and its tax-avoiding owners,” the group’s UK spokesperson, Sarah Lunnon, said. Other climate campaign organisations, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, say bailouts are only acceptable if they come with green conditions. They say airline companies should pay a fair share of taxes and not rely on offsets to reduce emissions, as they are currently doing. Among the measures they propose are fuel taxes on domestic flights (which are currently tax free) and the introduction of a frequent flier levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world’s 7.6bn population flies frequently. “If governments want to address the twin challenges of Covid and climate change, the political moment is now,” says Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “Policies to curb frequent flying could benefit both public health and the global environment.” He said passengers should also be given information about the carbon costs of their flights, which would allow them to support more efficient airlines. The difference between companies can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Even before the pandemic, the airline industry was feeling public pressure from “the Greta effect”, direct action by Extinction Rebellion and the high court decision to block Heathrow expansion because it posed unacceptable climate risks. The Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said the UK should build back better after the Covid-19 crisis. “The government can accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation, by helping to scale up new energy sources, such as sustainable aviation fuels, just as they did successfully for solar and wind. Any company that is bailed out by the government should commit to net-zero emissions well before 2050.” Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, prompting hundreds of job losses and fears of many more to follow. British Airways and its parent company AIG did not respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment about their willingness to accept tighter controls on emissions. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said he will not treat the aviation industry as a special case, but might consider bailouts on a case-by-case basis. Green party politicians say a clearer position is necessary to help workers in the sector to transition to other jobs. “Whilst a reduction in flying will have a tremendously positive impact on the environment, we need to ensure jobs are created elsewhere for those currently working in the aviation industry,” the Brighton mayor, Alex Phillips, said. “This could mean, for example, that workers are either offered the opportunity to retire in dignity or to retrain in new sectors – whether they be in zero-emission transport or low carbon jobs that we are in need of both now and in the future.” The issue is likely to linger long after the lockdown. The International Air Transport Association says demand for air travel will not recover until 2023 at the earliest. Reduce flights. Demand is unlikely to recover for at least three years so the simplest way to reduce aviation emissions is to have fewer planes in the air. Tax aviation fuel. Initially just for domestic flights so they do not have an unfair advantage against low-emission rail services. Air France has been told it cannot have a bailout unless it phases out flights that compete with train journeys of 2hr 30mins or less. This should later be widened to international flights, which are responsible for 90% of airline emissions in Europe.. Introduce a frequent flyer levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world’s 7.8bn population flies frequently. Increasing costs for them would make a bigger difference than asking people to end their annual overseas holiday. Provide transparent data on carbon emissions of flights so customers can avoid less efficient airlines. Few people are currently aware of the data, but the difference can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Incorporate the aviation sector into national climate targets. Currently the UK’s Climate Change Act only mentions airlines rather than making them part of the country’s emissions calculations, which Thunberg described last year as “extremely creative accounting”. Reduce fleet sizes by scrapping old, gas-guzzling planes. This would also reduce the risk that low petrol prices will prompt budget airlines to rent cheap planes and run them almost empty, which would keep them in business but increase emissions per passenger. Halt airport expansion. Campaigners won an important victory in February when the high court ruled against Heathrow expansion due to the climate risks. But many other airports plan to open new terminals and runways in the UK and elsewhere in the world. Invest in green fuel and tech. The French government has said Air France must use alternatives to fossil fuels for at least 2% of flights by 2024. Norway is pioneering electric planes and biofuel from waste products. Heathrow says the UK government should also promote cleaner fuel."
"**The total number of people dying in the UK is a fifth above normal levels for this time of year, figures show.**
There were 14,276 deaths registered in the week to 20 November - nearly 2,500 higher than the five-year average.
Just over 3,000 of those deaths involved Covid - 199 above the previous week, the data from the national statistics agencies showed.
That rise does though represent a slowing in the increase in Covid deaths that have been seen through the autumn.
The previous week the Covid death toll had jumped by 600.
These figures are based on death certificates that are filled in by doctors.
They differ from the daily figures produced by the government that rely on someone testing positive for Covid.
The two systems are showing very similar numbers in terms of Covid deaths.
Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West saw the highest rates of death during the period.
Sarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust, said the death toll ""brings home the reality"" of why continued restrictions are needed.
But she also pointed to the ""untold impact"" of the extra deaths at home - they are around 1,000 higher than normal.
She said this suggests people may not be getting the support they need for other conditions while the NHS is under pressure from Covid."
"The lionfish is a stunning, mesmerising and highly adorned creature that drifts slowly through coral reefs, seemingly unaware of its natural beauty. But it is quickly causing devastation and destruction to the nature it inhabits, decimating biodiversity in the marine environment. The lionfish hails from the warm, marine waters of the South Pacific and Indian oceans. Here it feeds on a huge variety of prey including smaller fish, molluscs and invertebrates, sometimes blowing water to disorient its prey before consuming them.  The most noticeable feature of the lionfish is the line of spines that runs along the length of its body, with more fanning out from the fins. These spines are striped, brown and white, providing a warning colouration to indicate that they are highly venomous, even to humans. This results in few natural predators, with the exception of moray eels and sharks.  In their natural habitat, lionfish are part of a marine ecosystem that has evolved to interact in harmony, with each species playing a vital role. So, how has the lionfish gradually become responsible for creating havoc across the oceans?  Unfortunately, the lionfish has established populations off south-eastern USA, in the Caribbean and more recently, the Mediterranean. Here, they have essentially invaded the area, preying voraciously on native fish species, increasing rapidly in abundance, and expanding over a vast range.  For example, the first lionfish were reported near Florida in 1985 but by 2001 they had become established across the eastern seaboard of the USA, with densities of more than 100 fish per hectare. Lionfish now outnumber native fish across many sites, and in parts of the western Atlantic are over four times as abundant as they are in their native area. It is not known exactly how lionfish populations first colonised these locations, but theories include the intentional release from the aquatic trade, and unintentional release through Hurricane Andrew washing captive specimens into the sea, or via boat ballast tanks accidentally containing specimens. After arriving in a new part of the sea, the lionfish reproduces at an astonishing and alarming rate, capable of spawning every two to three days, all year round. The eggs are released into open water where they hatch and drift in the plankton, before settling onto a reef.  This means there are potentially millions of eggs hitching a ride on the ocean currents for around a month at a time, giving lionfish huge potential to spread fast and wide across a continually moving body of water.  Alongside their voracious appetite – their stomach can expand up to 30 times its size – the local prey are unfamiliar with this new predator, making the new environment an ideal hunting ground. The indirect effects of this include a reduction in prey for the native predators, causing a major imbalance of the ecosystem. The lionfish also has no known natural predators outside of its native range to keep its populations in check. Even predators of eggs and juvenile lionfish across the globe currently remain unknown.  We are left with the only true predator being humans – and the need to cull lionfish is becoming an urgent priority for conservation. There have been many calls from both nature and economic groups, stating that targeted culling of this invasive species is the only effective way to reduce their numbers. There are several ways this can happen. Firstly, recreational scuba divers have been trying to keep numbers in check by culling them. But the venomous nature of lionfish means that divers need to be specially trained. Consequently, groups such as the Fraternal Order Of Lionfish Slayers (FOOLS) have been set up to maintain care for divers who can help reduce the amount of lionfish safely. Some divers are trialling the use of traps to aid safer and more rapid culling of larger numbers. In the Caribbean, the answer to culling has come from researchers at Robots In Service of the Environment (RSE) with their “Lionfish Terminator”.  This robotic zapper has been developed in an attempt to cull lionfish remotely. While there is still a long way to go in terms of full ocean deployment, this could restore the native balance of the ecosystem. However, another way to control lionfish numbers is to eat them. They are quickly becoming a delicacy on restaurant menus, and have also found their way onto supermarket shelves. Hopefully this opportunistic demand will help to reduce their numbers drastically – but even this could be too little too late.  Eventually, as with all invasive species, the lionfish will find its functional niche and the balance of the ecosystem will be restored. But the current invasion into the Mediterranean has sent a ripple through the natural dynamics of predators and prey, with serious effects on local fisheries and tourism.  We cannot simply wait for balance to be restored. We need to restore the health of the regional marine ecosystems and eradicate such a visually alluring threat before the inevitable apocalyptic destruction."

The European Union’s leaders said they wanted the United Kingdom to remain in the EU. But Brussels offered only minimal concessions to British Prime Minister David Cameron, undercutting his effort to sell the benefits of continued EU membership. Now the Eurocrats who dominate EU policy are attempting to push the UK out the door. London should refuse to play their game: slowing down the process would maximize its leverage.



The principal argument for the EU is that it has created a common economic market. The most powerful argument against it is that continental elites are attempting to create a superstate by stealth. The EU’s post‐​vote behavior reinforces this criticism.



The vote to Leave shocked Eurocrats across Europe. Even many Brexit advocates believed that Remain would carry the day. Thus, the UK is just coming to terms with the magnitude of its people’s decision. The British government is not prepared to announce a Brexit program.



However, EU leaders almost immediately began pressing London to act. They want the UK to trigger Article 50, which begins a two‐​year process to renegotiate a departing member’s relationship with the EU. Once taken the decision cannot be reversed. And if no agreement is reached within two years the country is unceremoniously defenestrated without any special access to the European market. The provision almost certainly was drafted to maximize the EU’s leverage.





London should refuse to play their game: slowing down the process would maximize its leverage.



Pushing the Brexit button would be a bad idea. The UK need not hurry. Nothing will change until Article 50 is implemented. The British government should hold off until it is ready.



First, the situation is chaotic. The prime minister is resigning. The opposition leader might be forced to resign. Scotland might again vote for independence. Northern Ireland might be forced to choose between its island neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, and its political home, the UK. No one is ready to discuss Brexit terms.



Second, with both leading parties in flux, waiting would allow a new government and opposition to emerge. The four largest parliamentary parties supported remaining in the EU, so they should attempt to reach a common exit program. While it is difficult to imagine legislators refusing to respect the popular will, how to implement the vote remains to be decided. A new government should be in office first.



Third, the Eurocrats have split between those determined to impose punitive terms in order to discourage other states from leaving and those who prefer to be generous and maximize continued cooperation. Better to let passions cool before beginning negotiations. It is in everyone’s interest to preserve economic relationships and make Britain’s exit as smooth as possible.



Fourth, when the Brexit trigger is pulled is a political, not legal issue. The referendum was advisory. No enabling legislation has been passed. A Leave majority does not exist in Parliament. The existing government and opposition backed staying. Effective negotiations won’t be possible until a government, backed by a stable majority, is prepared to act. Even a new government might want to move slowly, perhaps empaneling a commission of worthies to work through the complicated issues, followed by a public discussion. Indeed, with the Conservatives so badly split while enjoying only a small majority, a new election might be necessary.



Fifth, waiting would increase London’s bargaining power. EU officials are divided over Brexit’s timing. Everyone would like to resolve the UK’s status to promote economic as well as political stability. However, since negotiations most likely will take years, even starting now would have no impact until well into the future. The Eurocrats understand that accelerating the process would put greater pressure on London to make concessions, since a shorter deadline would threaten to leave the UK outside of the EU without any special access to the European market. However, Britain can play the same game by delaying.



Sixth, as passions cool the desire to exact revenge — to punish Britain to discourage other exiteers — likely will fade. German Chancellor Angela Merkel differed from her colleagues, indicating that there is “no reason to be in a way especially nasty during the negotiations.” While punitive measures might provide emotional satisfaction for some, failing to reach an agreement with the world’s fifth and Europe’s second largest economy would hurt everyone. Continued commercial links between the UK and continent are too important to sacrifice in a fit of pique. Ironically, a vengeful, arbitrary Brussels would reinforce the very behavior which has generated popular antipathy. In the meantime London could begin informal chats with other governments in an attempt to build support for a smoother exit.



Seventh, slowing the process would give Washington more time to play a positive role. It should start by indicating its willingness to begin negotiations with the UK over a free trade agreement as soon as the Brits are ready. The U.S. also should indicate that a smoother UK-EU divorce would improve the chances of a U.S.-EU trade pact. The last thing America wants is intra‐​European hostilities.



Eighth, holding off on the official trigger creates at least a possibility of rapprochement between the UK and EU. Brexit just might shock Europe’s leading powers toward serious reforms — blocking further political unification, ensuring democratic accountability, and protecting national sovereignty, for instance. Although a few deluded EU officials speak of accelerating and deepening European integration — “more Europe,” as they say — German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble called the idea “crazy” after the British vote. Donald Tusk, one of the EU’s many presidents (of the European Council), admitted that “ordinary people, the citizens of Europe, do not share our Euro‐​enthusiasm.” Even a “two‐​speed” Europe with countries agreeing to different degrees of integration appears far‐​fetched with populism on the rise across the continent.



The EU will have to work to regain public trust and support. If successful, the EU might even change attitudes in the UK. After all, upcoming elections in several nations could dramatically change the continent’s political climate. Even the French economy minister Emmanuel Macron proposed “to organize a true European referendum in its real sense” on a “new project” and “road map.” That would be unprecedented.



The ultimate impact of Brexit remains to be seen. Much of Europe is aflame, with the political center contracting in one country after another.



In such a world, all parties should allow the passions political battle to cool. Pressure from Brussels on the Cameron government is empty: neither the EU nor other member states can force London to leave. The UK likely will voluntarily yield its turn next year at the rotating Council presidency. The majority could exclude British officials from meetings; the Commission could fire British staff. But London still need not prematurely trigger Brexit.



In fact, slowing down the process would benefit Europe as well as the UK. A hasty, angry negotiation would serve no one. The British vote could change the EU for the better. There’s no need to hurry Brexit.

Another classic example I just happened to come across is one by warmist Ramez Naam who runs a blogsite, which had not been known to me previously.
In his latest article he claims that 2013 December Arctic sea ice is less than 2006 summer sea ice, and is less than every summer before that – probably for the last 1000 years! The chart he presents is as follows:

Do you see how the curve is currently less than what it was in the summer of 2006?
Unfortunately Mr Naam is not able to read a chart correctly and so he draws a totally preposterous conclusion. The chart on which he bases his conclusion is not one that shows absolute Arctic sea ice volume, but one that shows Arctic sea ice volume ANOMALY.
Although it’s possible that there have been years in the last 1000 years where summer volume has actually exceeded the current December 2013 volume, there’s no way in hell that volume now is less than it was in September 2006.
Naam actually gets invited on television as an expert on climate economics and energy policy, see here for example, has over 5000 Twitter followers, has authored books and won awards.
Honest mistakes can happen, and hopefully Naam will issue a correction.

"The former Queensland deputy premier and treasurer, Jackie Trad, says her outspoken progressive views – including a successful push to reform abortion laws – made her the target of a “concerted campaign” by political opponents and media commentators in the state. Trad resigned from the cabinet last week amid an integrity scandal. The state’s corruption watchdog is investigating allegations the influential Labor left MP interfered in the recruitment process for a local school principal.  She tells Guardian Australia – her first interview since standing down – that the past week had been a “bruising time”. In broad-ranging comments about coal and climate, Trad says the sort of partisan “zero-sum” politics that has taken hold in Queensland, including the pre-federal election convoy to the Adani coalmine site, has undermined genuine action to address the climate crisis. Her decision to leave the ministry was made out of concern she would become a distraction for the government in an election year. A contributing factor was the way in which she had become the constant subject of personal and political attacks. “I made that decision in consultation with my husband,” Trad says. “There’s no doubt that I’ve been a target for quite some time and I just didn’t want that to be a distraction for the party that I have worked with and for so long. I didn’t want it to be a distraction for my work in my community. But I also need to take stock. “There’s a concerted campaign against me because I guess I’ve stood up, I’ve stood up for the values my community care about and because there have been positive outcomes in that respect. “I’ve not decided to be a small target. I’ve not decided to sit down and write polite letters and I get that. I get that the LNP have an agenda of payback because of the leadership role I played in the abortion law reform debate.” In some premature political obituaries last week, Trad was described as a “defining influence” on the Palaszczuk government; in others her portrayal was as unpopular, double-crossing, ruthless, self-confident, ambitious, arrogant and dodgy. There’s an investigation into Trad (no findings)on the appointment process of a school principal. Result:10 pgs of Murdoch coverage. I await attention to a)Morrison's involvement in sports rorts b)Morrison misleading parliament on Angus Taylor c)Taylor refusing a police interview pic.twitter.com/LWAfbua71w “There is a particular world view that is pushed by a lot of media outlets – it’s not my world view, it’s not the world view of my community,” Trad says. “There is a characterisation that’s happening that I think completely misses the mark. “There are lots of commentators in the business of politics and the business of government and the media. There are a lot of people wanting to have a snipe. In every community I have been to, that’s in Julia Creek or Cairns or Maryborough, Queenslanders are nothing but respectful, appreciative of your time and efforts. “There is a world of difference between what I experience on the ground and what people will say in their commentary.” The portrayal of Trad as too progressive or extreme for Queensland plays into the binary way many seek to divide the state into tribes from “the city” and “the regions”. Trad’s home for 40 years, and the heart of her electorate, is Brisbane’s eclectic and progressive community of West End. Her seat of South Brisbane is broadly considered at serious risk of falling to the Greens. That political dynamic has created a narrative that has placed Trad at the centre of each government policy shift, to the left or right. Every government position has been scrutinised as if the folks of West End and broader Queensland are at crossed purposes. That sort of partisan “zero-sum politics” is what leaves Trad cold.She says: “There are big idiosyncrasies right through Queensland. We have such a deep rich identity throughout the state but I think what the last federal election showed was that zero-sum politics throughout our state creates so much division. “One of the things that really does divide our community is this zero-sum game that many political parties play, political parties on the left and the right. [They say] the system is broken, there’s no use operating under that system. “As hard as it is to be plugging away and chipping away, that is more important.” Trad has often championed progressive reforms in Queensland and often finds herself the lightning rod for critics. She had campaigned since the 1990s for the legalisation of abortion in Queensland, achieved in 2018. Hey, @LyleShelton, QLD abortion law reform done and dusted ✅ Time you toddled off to find another 21st Century progressive cause of equality and fairness to campaign against... and lose. https://t.co/20LMcfpdU7 On energy and climate change, Trad has found her efforts hemmed into an increasingly partisan public debate. She is still criticised for comments, made in parliament last year, that a global shift away from thermal coal use should require a transition and reskilling plan for Queensland workers and communities. On the other hand, Queensland Labor’s coal-friendly policy shift last year means Trad is no favourite of the Stop Adani crowd. She says opponents of coalmining and the Adani Carmichael project in north Queensland have played into a binary, divisive narrative that has set back efforts to address the climate crisis. “The convoy that went up to Clermont [led by former Greens leader Bob Brown, before the federal election], there were no winners out of that,” Trad says. “There was no outcome to that protest. There was no change in policy. It caused a great sense of anger and fear in the community and I guess my view as a progressive has been around achieving the change that’s necessary incrementally. You’ve got to bring people along, you can’t do it like that. “I’ve sat down with so many people and had so many conversations on Adani, thermal coal, metallurgical coal – this is something that a lot of people want to talk about, and I understand that and I understand that climate change is making people fearful. “What motivates me is how do we harness cheap clean electricity to create the industrial jobs that our community needs. There are many examples of industry moving towards renewable energy. It can make operations more competitive ... right throughout the state.” Pressed on her position on the Adani coalmine, Trad says: “Again I think that points to a zero-sum outcome. At the end of the day, there are export markets and while the world continues to change to clean renewable energy those export markets will be functioning. “I think communities are best placed to understand their own challenges, and to engage with policymakers around their own challenges. If we had 10 years ago adopted Kevin Rudd’s emissions trading scheme we would not be talking about these issues because quite frankly, we would have harnessed so much more cheap, clean renewable energy there would have been so much industrial change in Queensland. “That is a perfect example of the zero-sum game of politics. On the left it got defeated because it wasn’t good enough. On the right it was too [strong].” Last year, Trad was cleared by a Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission assessment of her purchase of a $700,000 investment property at Woolloongabba near the Cross River Rail project she oversaw. The CCC recommended legislative reforms as a result. The CCC has now decided to launch a formal investigation – a step beyond the assessment of Trad’s house purchase – into the appointment process for a principal at a new South Brisbane high school and allegations Trad interfered. She denies knowing any of the candidates. “It is an investigation under foot and I really can’t prejudice that investigation [by commenting], but I do see there’s an irony here in that the LNP are claiming there was interference in that process, but they’ve initiated a process with the CCC and want to interfere with that,” Trad says. On Monday, having stepped away from the ministry, Trad announced on Facebook that she would recontest South Brisbane, where the Liberal National party has pledged to direct preferences to the Greens and many pundits have written off her chances. She was also expected to lose in 2017, but has consistently rejected suggestions she could move to a safer seat. “This is my home, my lifelong home,” Trad says. “I’m really keen to get out and about in South Brisbane. What else we need to do as a community to make sure we are fairer, we don’t leave people behind. I got into politics … to actually improve the lives of people, I’m motivated by things like injustice and unfairness. “It’s been a bruising time for me, but I’ve been so overwhelmed by support for people locally and I understand they have great ambitions to see some good things happen. Their unfinished business is my unfinished business.”"
"Before the pandemic struck, Sara Blazey made the same three-hour commute to work, three days a week, for the better part of 12 years. The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening. With the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared “essential” services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions. To ensure they could do so safely, the organisation did what some commentators long thought impossible and began to transition its employees into working from home.  “There were a couple of us older ones in the office who said it all sounds too hard, really,” Blazey says. “And then we were reluctant to work from home. My home is my home. I don’t particularly want to do my work from there.” As the country went through a collective tech upgrade, millions of workers like Blazey retreated from office blocks and entire cities emptied out. It was a pattern that would be replicated worldwide. Streets devoid of cars and pavements free of people were so haunting that photographs of cities including New York, Paris and Sydney were shared across social media. Within Australia, the scale of this change was captured in data obtained by the Grattan Institute. Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people’s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th. Those like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world. Already transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor’s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea – which has been around since the 1980s – as a “game changer” for regions along its route. “High-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,” King said. As an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for “shovel-ready” projects. Marion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years – if not longer – before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions. “The thing about fast rail is it plays to our dreams,” Terrill says. “We love fast rail. It’s something people respond to emotionally. It’s all things to all people: it’s going to create jobs, take the pressure off cities, help regions, or serve as stimulus.” “When we looked at it, most of the benefits go to business travellers going between Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.” Terrill says this applies not only to future projects, but extends to existing ones which should now come under review. With no vaccine expected for at least 18 months – if ever – it is possible social distancing regulations may remain even as restrictions on social movement are lifted. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify many existing projects, including the $18.6bn WestConnex underground roadway and a second airport for Sydney. These decisions may raise questions about the future of mass transit itself, especially among austerity-minded governments concerned about their debt burdens. Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial. The risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what’s needed is a massive expansion. “The virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,” Dovey says. “One of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting. This, in my view, is what makes cities work. “If people want to stay two metres apart from each other into the future, that will kill cities.” Thought of in this way, Covid-19 is the sociological equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack – where a swarm of computers repeatedly attempt to access the same system all at once, eventually overloading it with demand. If at the start of the pandemic the main concern was the ability of health systems to cope, now the worry is that secondary systems like transport will buckle. The consequences are profound. If density and walkability combine to make cities vibrant places to live, public transport is the sinew that makes it possible. Cars may have dominated cities over the last century but in the last decade patronage of public transport has slowly grown once more. Should this trend be broken, Dovey says, the result would be “tragic”. “Reducing public transport to 30% will kill cities,” he says. “We really need to go the other way.” These concerns go beyond trains, trams and buses to the “microspatiality” of cities and efforts to green them. The more room provided for cars, the less there is for footpaths. Lifts in high-rises built to handle eight to 10 people become unworkable when they are limited to one or two. “Right now a lot of people will avoid public transport for a while, which means they’ll get in their cars,” Dovey says. “And that will produce demand for more roads, as it always does. “People still believe building roads can ease congestion but that is not true. All it does is stimulate demand for cars. This is going to set back major moves for cities that have been going on for a long time, particularly in trying to claw back space for usage from cars.” In January 2019 the Australian car fleet numbered 19.5m, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With millions now out of work or working from home, many of these vehicles have remained off the road. What comes next depends on what happens when restrictions are eased and those people go back to work – particularly as global oil prices remain low. The cause was simple enough. As whole national economies were put on ice at the start of the pandemic, the world’s oil producers kept pumping even as demand fell off a cliff. When they ran out of storage the mismatch between supply and demand grew so chronic oil producers in Russia found it easier to burn their excess, marking a disaster for efforts to combat climate change. “Oil fields are not like wine bottles, where you can put in a cork and return to it later,” Jeff Colgan says. “Shutting an oil field down can damage it, which reduces or even eliminates the field’s future production.” Colgan is the Richard Holbrooke associate professor of political science at Brown University and expert on the global oil industry, who says low fuel prices will last for some time. “Nothing lasts forever in the oil business but low oil prices are probably here to stay for at least the rest of the year and perhaps much longer,” he says. “Even when consumer demand increases after lockdowns end, there is an awful lot of inventory build-up that will keep prices from rising too quickly.” Against this global backdrop, Australia – which boasts the highest sulphur content fuel in the OECD and rising road transport emissions – finds itself caught between two competing futures. On the one hand, persistent low oil prices will make petrol cars cheaper to run, frustrating any attempt to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles as part of a transition to a zero-carbon economy. The alternative scenario is exemplified by China. When Australia’s largest trading partner lifted restrictions and moved to reopen its factories early this month, its people stayed home. Should this pattern be repeated the world over, the cumulative fall in demand would destabilise oil-producing economies, while making it harder to decarbonise transport at home. Some like John Quiggin lean more to this second scenario. While he acknowledges incentives created in the post-pandemic world may lead to less public transport and more cars on the road, the University of Queensland economist says “most forces are going the other way”. If historically the opposition to working from home by business was a meta-conversation about their ability to trust their workforce, the focus could shift to basic costs as social distancing regulations remain and the capacity of a working office falls. “Offices are going to be under pressure to keep a lot of space and the very low-cost way of doing that is to give people a choice about whether they come in or not,” Quiggin says. “Meanwhile, electric vehicles are improving all the time. Their take-up comes with anything that pauses the growth of the car fleet which gives EVs a chance.” What is true for the average employee will also be true for the boardroom. Even if Australia has avoided the worst of the virus, other countries have not. Many will remain in a state of lockdown for some time, forcing individual countries or regions to become more self-reliant. Freight may continue to move across borders into the future but people will not. Anyone looking to travel for business faces the prospect of a mandatory five- to 14-day quarantine each time a border is crossed. In the end, it will be easier – and cheaper – to do deals by video conference. The same could also be said for Australia’s tourism, education and aviation sectors. Education-related travel services and personal travel services respectively ranked as Australia’s fourth and fifth largest exports in 2018-19. After the pandemic, tour operators, universities and airlines will no longer be able to rely on a steady stream of international travellers and students – a reality that is already forcing a restructure. Since Quiggin became among the first to publicly call time on the airlines in late March, Virgin Australia has fallen into administration. Early on the government described Qantas and Virgin as “too essential to fail”, but it has so for allowed the weaker of the two companies to collapse. What happens next, Quiggin says, should be watched carefully. “What happens to the airlines will be a signal for what it plans for the rest of the country,” Quiggin says. “There are three possibilities. One is [Virgin] will bounce back in the way the government hopes. One is it won’t bounce back and they’ll let it fall in a heap. The third is they’ll have to intervene or maybe they’ll be forced to do things they currently do not want to do.” It is this that underlines the significance of the moment. In deciding the minutiae of how Australians get around, the country’s political leadership finds itself with enormous power to reshape society. Should they reach into the past to direct the future, the result could be a missed opportunity at best, or a grim new reality. Some projects, after all, lend themselves to the moment. Fixing the national broadband network – a $36bn international embarrassment – may eliminate the daily commute for millions while providing stimulus. The most radical may be even more simple. “One of the advantages is that right now the streets are empty of cars and we’re going to need more pedestrian space if we’re going to continue social distancing,” Dovey says. “We should be out there turning streets into walkways. “All you need is a bit of authority and paint on the road. We could do a lot of good for cities if we had the nerve and the ideas.”"
"Anti-Adani activists will bombard the world’s largest insurance broker with calls, emails and social media messages in a virtual protest on Tuesday ahead of its annual general meeting in New York. Campaigners have already managed to speak directly with Marsh executives, who are understood to be considering a new climate policy at this week’s meeting. The company is understood to be working for Adani to find insurance policies for the Carmichael mine. This year was supposed to be Australia’s climate flashpoint. Activists had begun arriving in central Queensland for a “red alert” campaign of daily physical protests to disrupt construction of the world’s most controversial coalmine. Instead, amid the coronavirus crisis, Adani has made sober, unhindered progress on its Carmichael coal project. Opponents have been forced to abandon plans for escalating civil disobedience. The Indian miner told Guardian Australia the campaign against it has “failed”. But while the public health emergency has placed physical activism into hibernation at a critical point for Adani, the climate movement has pivoted its tactics in a way that some hope could more effectively disrupt the project and the global coal sector. “In many ways, we think the online rally will be more effective than a rally outside an office,” says Carrie Tsai, the coordinator of Stop Adani Redfern. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We’re expecting a lot of people from the US to join the online rally. Marsh is based in the US and Stop Adani is a global campaign. Moving online has meant we’ve been collaborating more with people around the globe. “We know the executives of Marsh are listening to our campaign, because they’re on the other side of the phone.” The school climate strikers, who protested in their hundreds of thousands last year, sought to maintain momentum during the enforced isolation of the coronavirus crisis by rallying from their bedrooms. Other groups have run targeted online campaigns. Galilee Blockade, which typically seeks to target businesses in the Adani supply chain, has focused on the construction firm BMD, which has a contract to build parts of the Carmichael rail corridor. Activists believe they can continue to run effective campaigns in isolation. “During this pandemic our movement has turned to a lot of online organising to keep the community aware and informed of what the mining industry has been doing in this period,” says Amy Booth, a spokeswoman for Frontline Action on Coal. “That has made so many people impassioned to take a stand as soon as restrictions allow them to, to head to the Galilee coal basin region to stop work. “The frontlines movement is still as strong as ever, and as soon as restrictions allow us to start being in areas where we need to stop work, we’ll be doing just that.” Meanwhile, work continues on the mine and Adani says it remains on schedule to send its first shipment next year. Many activists are sceptical about that timeline – especially given the likely impact of the Covid crisis on the world’s coal markets.“We recognise how important it is to continue our operations where safe to do so to provide certainty of employment for our staff, contractors and the thousands of people across north and central Queensland who indirectly rely on our project for their livelihoods,” an Adani spokeswoman said. “Anti-mining activists and the so-called charities that fund and employ them have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at us to try and stop us building the Carmichael mine and rail project and they have failed. “After more than eight years of working on our project we have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to Queenslanders and we continue to get on with the construction of the Carmichael project.”"

State and federal governments face a daunting fiscal outlook. The national debt stands at 60 percent of GDP, its highest level since World War II. Under current projections this ratio will rise to more than 75 percent of GDP by 2020 and continue increasing thereafter. States are also facing severe budget shortfalls.



Politicians and the public express concern about the debt, but standard proposals for expenditure cuts or tax increases garner little support. Understandably, therefore, some politicians, commentators, interest groups, and citizens have embraced unconventional approaches to closing fiscal gaps, such as legalizing drugs.



Legalization would reduce state and federal deficits by eliminating expenditure on prohibition enforcement — arrests, prosecutions, and incarceration — and by allowing governments to collect tax revenue on legalized sales.



This potential fiscal windfall is of particular interest because California, which is facing a budget shortfall of $19.9 billion for fiscal 2011, will vote Nov. 2 on a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana under California law. Advocates of the measure have suggested the state could raise billions in annual tax revenue, in addition to saving criminal‐​justice expenditure or reallocating this expenditure to more important priorities. Should the California measure pass and generate the forecasted budgetary savings, other states would likely follow suit.





[T]he budgetary implications of legalization are neither trivial nor overwhelming.



In our recent study, just released by the Cato Institute, we estimate the impact of legalization on federal, state, and local budgets. The report concludes that drug legalization would reduce government expenditure about $41.3 billion annually. Roughly $25.7 billion of this savings would accrue to state and local governments, and roughly $15.6 billion to the federal government. About $8.7 billion of the savings would result from legalization of marijuana, $20 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $12.6 billion from legalization of all other drugs.



Legalization would also generate tax revenue of roughly $46.7 billion annually if drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco. About $8.7 billion of this revenue would result from legalization of marijuana, $32.6 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $5.5 billion from legalization of all other drugs.



These estimates should be taken with several large grains of salt. The markets for illegal drugs are opaque, and different approaches to estimating either the size of this market or the effect of legalization can therefore vary substantially. Further complicating matters, different approaches make different implicit or explicit assumptions about exactly what policy change is under consideration, such as whether legalization applies nationwide, under both federal and state law (the scenario we consider), or in just one state, just for marijuana, and just under state law (the California experiment). Our estimates are in the middle of available numbers.



The fact that legalization would generate a fiscal dividend does not, by itself, make it a better policy than prohibition. Legalization would have many effects, and opinions differ on whether these are desirable on net. Both sides in this debate, however, should want to know the order of magnitude of the fiscal benefit that might arise from legalization.



Our results imply that the budgetary implications of legalization are neither trivial nor overwhelming. Legalization will not solve America’s fiscal woes; the budget effects are small in comparison with current deficits. Yet the budgetary benefits are more than mere rounding error; for those with mixed feelings about prohibition vs. legalization, these benefits might be a deciding factor.



Several specific aspects of our estimates bear comment.



Roughly half the budgetary savings comes from reduced criminal‐​justice expenditure on drug prohibition. For this component of the effect to show up in government budgets, policymakers would have to lay off police, prosecutors, prison guards, and the like. Such a move would be politically painful, so it might not occur. Reduced expenditure on enforcing prohibition can still be beneficial if those criminal‐​justice resources are redeployed to better uses, but that outcome is not easy to achieve.



Only about $17.4 billion in budgetary improvement can be expected to come from legalizing marijuana in isolation. Yet the current political climate gives no indication that legalization of other drugs is likely in the short term. So the budgetary impact from the politically possible component of legalization — marijuana — seems modest.



None of these considerations weakens the broader case against drug prohibition, which has always rested on the crime, corruption, and curtailment of freedom and civil liberties that are the side effects of attempting to fight drug use with police officers and prisons. What our estimates do provide are two additional reasons to end drug prohibition: reduced expenditure on law enforcement, and an increase in tax revenue from legalized sales.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last few days German meteorologists and media have been falling all over themselves in forecasting a possible ALL-TIME record high to hit Germany today. The current all-time high is 40.2°C set in 2003.
Well, it’s now 3 pm and so let’s look how close we are getting to setting that new, all-time record high…if we haven’t already!
Where I live, the temperature is 24°C. Doesn’t look like the all-time record high is going to be set here today.
So let’s look further east, where the blowtorch heat is really supposed to hit.
In Hannover it’s 27°C.
In Berlin it’s 33°C.

In Regensburg it’s 34°C.
Hmmm…what’s going on? So far nothing that is even remotely close to the 40.2°C all-time record high. Maybe this website here will help us find that new all-time record high we supposed to see today.
Here we see that the top temperature right now in Germany is 34.9°C in Konstanz. That’s more than 5°C below the all-time high we were supposed to reach today! Maybe I just need to be patient and wait an hour or so. Maybe the thermometer in Konstanz will jump a whole 5.3°C.
Clearly what we have just witnessed here is Germany’s forecasting debacle of the year, if not the decade. How come the forecasts, which were as recent as yesterday, were so far off? We’re not talking about being off by 1 or 2°C, but 5°C!
I’m going to write a longer commentary on this tomorrow. What we’ve had is an all-time record hyped temperature. Hysteria sweeps across Germany’s institutions again.

Above graph showing UHI by county population in California, from Goodridge 1996, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
McKitrick & Michaels Were Right: More Evidence of Spurious Warming in the IPCC Surface Temperature Dataset
Guest post by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.
The supposed gold standard in surface temperature data is that produced by Univ. of East Anglia, the so-called CRUTem3 dataset. There has always been a lingering suspicion among skeptics that some portion of this IPCC official temperature record contains some level of residual spurious warming due to the urban heat island effect. Several published papers over the years have supported that suspicion.
The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is familiar to most people: towns and cities are typically warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the replacement of natural vegetation with manmade structures. If that effect increases over time at thermometer sites, there will be a spurious warming component to regional or global temperature trends computed from the data.
Here I will show based upon unadjusted International Surface Hourly (ISH) data archived at NCDC that the warming trend over the Northern Hemisphere, where virtually all of the thermometer data exist, is a function of population density at the thermometer site.

Depending upon how low in population density one extends the results, the level of spurious warming in the CRUTem3 dataset ranges from 14% to 30% when 3 population density classes are considered, and even 60% with 5 population classes.
DATA & METHOD
Analysis of the raw station data is not for the faint of heart. For the period 1973 through 2011, there are hundreds of thousands of data files in the NCDC ISH archive, each file representing one station of data from one year. The data volume is many gigabytes.
From these files I computed daily average temperatures at each station which had records extending back at least to 1973, the year of a large increase in the number of global stations included in the ISH database. The daily average temperature was computed from the 4 standard synoptic times (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) which are the most commonly reported times from stations around the world.
At least 20 days of complete data were required for a monthly average temperature to be computed, and the 1973-2011 period of record had to be at least 80% complete for a station to be included in the analysis.
I then stratified the stations based upon the 2000 census population density at each station; the population dataset I used has a spatial resolution of 1 km.
I then accepted all 5×5 deg lat/lon grid boxes (the same ones that Phil Jones uses in constructing the CRUTem3 dataset) which had all of the following present: a CRUTem3 temperature, and at least 1 station from each of 3 population classes, with class boundaries at 0, 15, 500, and 30,000 persons per sq. km.
By requiring all three population classes to be present for grids to be used in the analysis, we get the best ‘apples-to-apples’ comparison between stations of different population densities. The downside is that there is less geographic coverage than that provided in the Jones dataset, since relatively few grids meet such a requirement.
But the intent here is not to get a best estimate of temperature trends for the 1973-2011 period; it is instead to get an estimate of the level of spurious warming in the CRUTem3 dataset. The resulting number of 5×5 deg grids with stations from all three population classes averaged around 100 per month during 1973 through 2011.
RESULTS
The results are shown in the following figure, which indicates that the lower the population density surrounding a temperature station, the lower the average linear warming trend for the 1973-2011 period. Note that the CRUTem3 trend is a little higher than simply averaging all of the accepted ISH stations together, but not as high as when only the highest population stations were used.

The CRUTem3 and lowest population density temperature anomaly time series which go into computing these trends are shown in the next plot, along with polynomial fits to the data:

Again, the above plot is not meant to necessarily be estimates for the entire Northern Hemispheric land area, but only those 5×5 deg grids where there are temperature reporting stations representing all three population classes.
The difference between these two temperature traces is shown next:

From this last plot, we see in recent years there appears to be a growing bias in the CRUTem3 temperatures versus the temperatures from the lowest population class.
The CRUTem3 temperature linear trend is about 15% warmer than the lowest population class temperature trend. But if we extrapolate the results in the first plot above to near-zero population density (0.1 persons per sq. km), we get a 30% overestimate of temperature trends from CRUTem3.
If I increase the number of population classes from 3 to 5, the CRUTem3 trend is overestimated by 60% at 0.1 persons per sq. km, but the number of grids which have stations representing all 5 population classes averages only 10 to 15 per month, instead of 100 per month. So, I suspect those results are less reliable.
I find the above results to be quite compelling evidence for what Anthony Watts, Pat Michaels, Ross McKitrick, et al., have been emphasizing for years: that poor thermometer siting has likely led to spurious warming trends, which has then inflated the official IPCC estimates of warming. These results are roughly consistent with the McKitrick and Michaels (2007) study which suggested as much as 50% of the reported surface warming since 1980 could be spurious.
I would love to write this work up and submit it for publication, but I am growing weary of the IPCC gatekeepers killing my papers; the more damaging any conclusions are to the IPCC narrative, the less likely they are to be published. That’s the world we live in.
UPDATE: I’ve appended the results for the U.S. only, which shows evidence that CRUTem3 has overstated U.S. warming trends during 1973-2011 by at least 50%.
I’ve computed results for just the United States, and these are a little more specific. The ISH stations were once again stratified by local population density. Temperature trends were computed for each station individually, and the upper and lower 5% trend ‘outliers’ in each of the 3 population classes were excluded from the analysis. For each population class, I also computed the ‘official’ CRUTem3 trends, and averaged those just like I averaged the ISH station data.
The results in the following plot show that for the 87 stations in the lowest population class, the average CRUTem3 temperature trend was 57% warmer than the trend computed from the ISH station data.

These are apples-to-apples comparisons…for each station trend included in the averaging for each population class, a corresponding, nearest-neighbor CRUTem3 trend was also included in the averaging for that population class.
How can one explain such results, other than to conclude that there is spurious warming in the CRUTem3 dataset? I already see in the comments, below, that there are a few attempts to divert attention from this central issue. I would like to hear an alternative explanation for such results.

Hurricane season is here again, and the good people at the National Hurricane Center are predicting a 70% chance of more activity than normal this year. I’m predicting a greater than 99.9% probability that this season’s windbags will be conflated with global warming.



We can look forward to another year of numbing hurricane hype. Tropical cyclones (the generic for hurricanes, typhoons, willi‐​willies, etc…) are the sexiest weather beasts on TV, with seductive eyes surrounded by towering _cumulonimbi_. A category 3 (out of 5) storm within a week’s distance from the East Coast commands 24/7 attention from The Weather Channel and at least 50% of CNN’s time. Given that storms get this close (or closer) a couple of times every year, the coverage seems a bit out of proportion.



It’s part of our culture. Hurricanes became media stars when Dan Rather, a cub reporter from Houston, convinced CBS headquarters in 1961 to add 15 minutes to the (then) 15 minutes of network news featuring — surprise — him, braving the Galveston Seawall while big, bad Hurricane Carla languorously eyed the Texas Coast. While there’s still debate about whether Carla may have actually been more powerful than 2005’s legendary Katrina, it is certainly true that she made Dan a rather big man.



So this year is supposed to be another big one. The planetary surface temperature is warmer than it was back in Carla’s day. Aren’t these two things related?



Hurricanes long since graduated from being singular weather events to becoming climatic signposts. After all, it seems pretty logical that they should be enhanced by global warming, as the thermal source that they convert to destructive kinetic energy is the heat of the ocean, which should go up with the surface temperature.



Tropical cyclones are a bit more complicated than “warmer ocean in, bigger hurricane out”. For months on end, the vast majority of the earth’s tropical oceans sport surface temperatures above 80°F, the threshold required for their formation. Given this massive amount of suitable ocean surface, why are there so few hurricanes? And why would warming of a degree or two really change this?



Under global warming, it turns out that the threshold temperature goes up too. A report published last November in _Nature Geoscience_ found a rise of about 0.5 degrees in that temperature in recent decades paralleling the observed rise in tropical ocean surface temperatures. Everything else being equal (which never occurs), this would mean no increase in hurricane frequency and intensity.



For over a decade, federal climatologist Kevin Trenberth has claimed that global warming will increase the frequency and strength of El Niño, the large periodic warming of the tropical Pacific. One of the few sure things about hurricane climatology is that Los Niños destroy Atlantic storms as they unfavorably shift the winds aloft.



The global warming‐​hurricane war has been raging in the scientific literature for over a decade. One of the major battles is over the quality of historical data, and whether or not hurricane statistics are being inflated by nonclimatic forces.



A few years ago I began to notice that cloud blobs of decidedly unseductive proportions began to be named as tropical cyclones.



While I’ve published some papers in the scientific literature on hurricanes and climate change, I never figured how to test that surmise. To my surprise, two weeks ago, my hypothesis was tested in a paper in _Journal of Geophysical Research,_ and it appears to be supportable. The paper shows that there has been no increase whatsoever in the number of Atlantic storms that last more than 48 hours. There has been a major increase in the number of short‐​lived storms; i.e. ones which the Hurricane Center wouldn’t have named decades ago.



On reason is because we have learned that even relatively weak tropical storms can produce extreme floods. People began to pay attention to this in 1979, when tropical storm Claudette drowned Alvin, in southeast Texas, under 45 inches of rain. In 1994, weak tropical storm Alberto killed 33 in the southeast, largely a result of over two feet of rain. Tropical storm Allison, in 2001, dropped 40 inches, again in southeast Texas.



While slightly warmer oceans should slightly enhance rainfall from tropical cyclones, all the refereed research out there indicates that such an effect won’t be detectable for decades, in part a result of the obviously great variability that exists in rainfall from these storms.



So we can go back and forth on whether or not hurricanes are getting worse because of global warming. But while we debate, nature adjudicates.



Ryan Maue at Florida State University has been tracking hurricane power over the years. That’s the square of the maximum wind speed summed over the lifetime of each storm. His results tell you everything you need to know:





Maue’s hurricane power index shows that current values are near the lowest ever measured, both in our hemisphere (black dots) and globally (blue dots), and exhibit no overall trend, effectively blowing any linkage between recent storms and global warming out of the water.



Both globally and in our hemisphere, total hurricane power is at or near the lowest it has ever been measured. So much for Hurricane hype.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI had to laugh reading the French reports I mention below.
A few days ago I saw the same kind of stuff in the Russian and Italian media: meteorologists and meteorological institutes forecasting a “killer 100-year 2013/14 winter“. It’s all over Europe. Where does this come from?
It seems that meteorologists Joe Bastardi’s and Dominik Jung’s preliminary, legitimate speculation of a possible colder-than-normal 2013/14 winter has been miscommunicated and morphed into a serious forecast of “a killer 100-year winter“. Everywhere in the European media I’m now seeing reports that a “really hard winter may be on the way“. Dude, fear and a rush for snow shovels is about to break out!
First the Belgium-based, French-language news site DH.be has an article titled: “On The Way To A Winter Of Death?“.
The piece cites German meteorologist Dominik Jung, who runs the site wetternet.de. Lately Jung has been analyzing European and American weather charts in order to try to get a heads up as to how the winter could shape up, which could serve as especially valuable information for a host of industries, e.g. tourism or retailing. But the DH.be writes:
Awaiting the arrival of winter, European meteorologists are already predicting an icy season, and not one that’s just run of the mill, but rather the coldest one in 100 years.
A natural phenomenon will be the source of the cold wave that is about to strike Europe head-on: the melting of Arctic ice which is cooling the oceans, which in turn leads to the formation of cold air currents that will plunge into our regions this winter.”
At this point, the reader already has the idea that it’s going to be a really harsh winter, and next thing you know he’s spreading it all over town.
DH.be later in the article does add that meteorologist Marc Vandiepenbeeck at the Royal Meteorological Institute (IRM) warns that the atmosphere is far too complex to make such predictions with any real degree of certainty, and that making such predictions is “wacky”.
DH.be writes Jung says that predictions of the most horrible winter in a 100 years must be taken with healthy dose of doubt. But then it writes:
…he maintains that the winter 2013/2014 will probably be ‘extremely bitter’.”
Where did the predictions of a bitter cold winter get started?

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




So we ask in this case, what is original source of this “super-winter forecast“? How did it all get started? The answer is a classic example of how normal, innocent speculation unintentionally can morph into a much huger story, eventually get accepted almost as a scientific fact, and then start to spread across the land.
Website CatNat.net here gives us good evidence of where the seed for the “100-year killer-winter” inadvertently got planted. CatNat writes:
…many European forecasters are predicting a cold one for 2013/2014. ‘Dominik Jung, German meteorologist, explains that next winter will be abnormally cold, and so does American Joe Bastardi, who works for weather giant AccuWeather, and who explains that ‘it’s going to be very cold’.”
Little of this is accurate, of course. Firstly, Joe stopped working for Accuweather a long time ago. Secondly I’m not aware of Joe ever saying: “It’s going to be a very cold winter.” I do recall him saying that NOAA was looking at the probability of a cold winter and that there were a couple of factors pointing to a cold winter. But he never predicted it to my knowledge.
Anyway, it seems that Joe’s Saturday Summary is gaining a good sized audience in Europe.
CatNat then explains that the cold winter prediction is “based on climatic indicators” which indicate that “Arctic air will plunge into Europe. The abnormal cold are also influenced by the Arctic oscillation (variation in atmospheric pressures at sea level between 20°N and the pole), one of the principal factors of influence on winter temperatures in the northern Hemisphere.”
CatNet adds:
For Americain meteorologist Joe Bastardi, low solar activity is also in play. A similar cycle was observed during the 1950s, with cold waves extending until spring.”
Near the end, CatNat does add that seasonal forecasts are weak in reliability, and that seasonal forecasts are barely better than flipping a coin. Yet, it’s doubtful that most readers ever got that far.
And now it’s too late. All of Europe it seems is now convinced that the coming winter is going to be a real tough one – maybe even the worst in a 100 years! Not because Joe Bastardi and Dominik Jung predicted so, but because their original speculation somehow got miscommunicated and morphed into a dire prediction as it passed through the media grapevine.
The two recent French reports cited above are just the latest. A few days ago I saw the same stuff in Russian and Italian media. I expect to see more such reports – maybe even soon at the Beeb.
Makes you think that maybe the same type of runaway fantasy occurred in climate science. An increase in the atmospheric concentration of a trace gas exploding into a multi-trillion dollar global panic.

"**There has been confusion after police asked beach-goers at Helen's Bay to leave the area on Sunday, citing Covid-19 regulations.**
Swimmers were using the popular County Down spot when officers arrived and asked them to disperse.
One man had been finishing a ""mile a day"" swimming challenge raising money for charity.
No fines were issued by police officers but they said they would ""not shy away from enforcement when it is necessary"".
Police said that they believed a large number of people had gathered to watch the charity swimming event.
However, a local businessman who was swimming at the beach said he was ""absolutely baffled"" by the police's approach.
Gareth Murphy told BBC News NI: ""I felt a huge level of frustration that we could have been in Ikea or Tesco but we were on the beach taking part in the sport which we love and we had to deal with that afterwards.
""More or less everyone left the beach. I just find it incredibly sad that the public resources of the police are being used to close down beaches for no reason.""
Mr Murphy said after he came out of the sea and was getting changed he was approached by six police officers.
He said he had seen them from the water walking ""systematically, approaching groups and threatening them with Â£200 fines"".
""I pointed out we could be at Ikea or Tesco. They said: 'This is an organised event'. We pointed out this is not, this is people taking part in something healthy.""
Cathy Martin, who lives in Helen's Bay, said she took a walk down to the beach with her children and dog. She told the Stephen Nolan Show it was busy, but that a lot of people there were residents.
She said she was then told by police officers that she would have to leave the beach as well.
""They basically came with the attitude that everyone was there for an organised event,"" she said.
""They're under a lot of pressure, they're under-resourced and they have a lot to cover, and I do respect that they have to respond to every complaint and I do respect that there probably was a complaint from residents about a lot of cars there or a lot of people there.
""But Helen's Bay is a big enough beach to hold 200 people, it doesn't justify them coming to break it up.""
In a statement the PSNI said: ""Our approach has been that we will engage, explain and encourage members of the community to comply with the Health Protection Regulations.
""The vast majority of our community are complying with the restrictions, which we all recognise, are asking people to restrict their personal and professional lives in a way none of us would ever have thought possible.
""While enforcement is our last resort, we have not, and will not, shy away from enforcement when it is necessary."""

Jim River, AK closed in on the all time record coldest temperature of -80°F set in 1971, which is not only the Alaska all-time record, but the record for the entire United States. Unfortunately, it seems the battery died in the weather station just at the critical moment.
Image from hamweather.com
While the continental USA has a mild winter and has set a number of high temperature records in the last week and pundits ponder whether they will be blaming the dreaded “global warming” for those temperatures, Alaska and Canada have been suffering through some of the coldest temperatures on record during the last week.
For example in  Circle Hot Springs, AK on Sunday, 29 Jan 2012 the HIGH temperature was a blistering -49°F, breaking the  -44°F record which has stood since 1917. It gets better. 
That same day in Circle Hot Springs the low temperature was  -58°F   breaking the old record of  -52°F set  in 1941 by six degrees.
Here’s a list of temperature records in Alaska from the past week:


Brrr!
While all that was happening, the weather station in Jim River, AK closed in on the all time record coldest temperature of -80°F set in 1971. That’s not only the Alaska all-time record, but the record for the entire United States. Unfortunately, the weather station stopped reporting at -79°F.

Note at 18:49 on 1/28/12 it stopped reporting all data except barometric pressure.
Some background on the equipment tells us the likely cause.
The station is the venerable Vantage Pro2 by Davis Instruments, arguably one of the best weather stations available to consumers. I have deployed several myself and put them online, for example here and here. They are hardy, accurate, and well constructed, being manufactured in the USA in Hayward, CA instead of some Chinese gadget mill. They also have NIST traceability on sensors.

The Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) communicates wirelessly with the console below, and the console has an optional PC and/or standalone Internet interface (for DSL/Cable modems) attached.

This station at weather station in Jim River, AK was recording temperatures in conditions way out of its design spec, it only goes to –40 F
From:  http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/manuals/07395-249_IM_06152.pdf

While they operate on solar power during the day, these units have an internal lithium battery for operation at night and through extended cloudy periods.
I suspect the internal CR123A Lithium 3 volt battery in the outside ISS died.  Note that on 2012-01-28 18:49:00 the data for barometric pressure is still reporting after temperature and other values die. At that temperature, the battery likely could not sustain enough voltage to keep the transmitter running.
The barometric pressure sensor is in the internal LCD console, inside the house/office where the unit is connected to the Internet. All other sensors are outside in the ISS.
The CR123A Lithium 3 volt battery specifications are:
3V 1400mAh Lithium BatteryWide operating temperature range: -40°C to 85°C

So it was operating way out of spec as well.
Some people have emailed me wondering about why the readings at  Jim River, AK stopped just shy of a new all time record. I don’t see any nefarious motive here, just simple equipment failure under extraordinary extreme conditions combined with Murphy’s Law.
Let’s hope the observer there has a backup thermometer, but who’d want to go outside in cold like that to read it?
h/t to Dr. Ryan Maue and Joe D’Aleo
BTW, if you want one of these splendid weather stations, you can get them here. Details here.
UPDATE: The NWS in Fairbanks moves quickly to disavow the temperature report. I suppose the Drudge link has the phones ringing off the hook. But here’s the interesting thing, the nearest other “official” station, PAPR at Prospect Creek Airport, AK only 0.9 miles away, is also offline.
Data Status
Over the last 28 days, no data was seen on the following dates: 2012-01-04 to 2012-01-16, 2012-01-18 to 2012-01-20, 2012-01-22 to 2012-01-29.
It would be interesting to see how they defend an official airport station failure.

RT/JL JAN 12
UPDATE2 1/31/2012 9:30AM PST
According to Gladstone and NCDC MMS, PAPR (Prospect Creek, just 0.9 mile from Jim River DOT station, and holder of the low temperature record from 1971) is an AWOS station, part of the “B” COOP network.
https://mi3.ncdc.noaa.gov/mi3qry/identityGrid.cfm?setCookie=1&fid=22862
Details on AWOS:
http://www.allweatherinc.com/aviation/awos_dom.html
and as I understand it, it is not rated to –80F, the specs for the thermistor say:
Ambient Temperature Sensor.
The sensor shall be thermally isolated in a
motor aspirated radiation shield to accurately measure air temperature.
A. Range. From –40C to +60C (-40 oF t o +140 oF)
B. Accuracy. ±0.3C.
C. Resolution. 1 oF.
Source: http://www.allweatherinc.com/pdf/awos_level_iii.pdf
So, given the official equipment there at Prospect Creek, it seems NOAA has either purposely or unintentionally created an impossibility of the Prospect Creek record of ever having been broken there again.

At WUWT, one thing we pride ourselves in is helping visitors learn about the issues and the science, even if those visitors should already know what these things mean. Take for example, Michael Tobis proprietor of “Only In it for the Gold” and “Planet3.0”, both heavily pro-warming sites. Readers may remember Mr. Tobis from his famous F-word Fusillade.
Mike came to WUWT to ask a simple question, and of course, we are always happy to help him out. 

Original comment asking to define “CAGW” here.
Honestly, I thought most everyone (especially the bloggers) in this debate knew this term, but apparently not. So, this post will make sure everyone does now.
CAGW is an abbreviation for Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming
For more abbreviations, see our WUWT Glossary Page

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke of the online flagship daily German Die Welt here writes a blog commentary titled: “German Politicians Want To Sex Up Climate Report“.
Chart right: Global temps tending downwards since 2007 IPCC AR4. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/.
Kulke writes that Germany’s political delegation steadfastly refuses to give up its cherished climate catastrophism. According to Kulke, in the previous IPCC reports bureaucrats used to be accused of watering down the results of the scientists in order to avoid having to implement draconian measures at home. But that’s not the case for Germany’s bureaucrats.
Kulke writes, “Especially considering the discussion from Germany’s hefty ministries, no efforts in watering down the catastrophic passages are expected to be made. To the contrary.”
When it comes to the AR5 Summary Report, which is set to be released Friday, Kulke writes that in its current draft:
…the ongoing one and half decades long pause in global warming is mentioned, for example, together with the notation that the models from climate scientists are unable to provide an explanation for it. The scientists working on this report feel it is necessary and important to mention this pause, but not some representatives of governments who would prefer to delete this passage. And it’s not just some politicians, but rather it’s foremost the delegates from two German ministries, mind you.”

//-->




Kulke adds that the German bureaucrats fear losing the scientific legitimacy that underpins their cause and are behaving is if to tell us:
We are not going to let our climate catastrophe to be taken away.”
Kulke then writes that it’s fortunate that a draft was made available to the public “even though this did not suit some IPCC strategists so well.” Kulke concludes:
Because of the current situation, it will be difficult to remove the passage about the warming pause from the summary report just because so much truth does not suit a few German ministry representatives.”
Also yesterday the online edition of Die Welt featured another piece, also written by Kulke, titled: “The Earth Is Warming Much More Slowly Than First Believed“.
Unfortunately the article is behind a paywall, but the title sums it all up. No matter what the IPCC decides to put in its final draft summary report, climate science will end up having been soiled – thanks to activist bureaucrats and scientists.

Andrew Revkin asked me to provide comments on this article of his where the National Climatic Data Center was asked to respond to Watts et al 2012:
A Closer Look at Climate Studies Promoted Before Publication
Here is what I sent to him:
My comments on Thorne’s response are pretty simple.
They still refuse to get out of the office, to examine firsthand the condition of the network and try to come up with hands on approaches for dealing with station inhomogeneity, but instead focus of trying to spot patterns in data and massage it. In my view this is the wrong approach and the reason that we are in this polarization  today.  We are conducting a grand experiment, and like any scientific experiment, you have to carefully watch how the data is being measured in the experiment environment, or problems will invalidate the measurement. If Climate Science operated under the same rules as Forensic Science, the compromised data would be tossed out on its ear. Instead, we are told to accept it as fully factual in the court of public opinion.
Until I came along with Watts 2009, they really weren’t looking closely at the issue. The SurfaceStations photography forced them into reaction mode, to do two things.

1. Close the worst USHCN stations, such as Marysville, CA (the station that started it all), Tucson, AZ (the University Science Dept/Weather Service Office that had the USHCN weather station in the parking lot), and Ardmore, OK (the USHCN station on the street corner). There are many others that have been closed.
If they are able to correct the data gathering problems back in the office with algorithms, why do they need to close these stations? Additionally, if they think they can get good data out of these stations with the myriad of adjustments they perform, why did they need to spend millions of dollars on the new Climate Reference Network commissioned in 2008 that we never hear about?
According to communications I received from Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, the National Weather Service is developing plans to eliminate up to half of all COOP network stations (of which USHCN is a subset) as a potential cost-cutting measure.
Some possible reasons: (1) not central to the core mission of the NWS; (2) poor data quality; (3) too much of a public relations headache with people putting embarrassing photographs online.
I would argue not for removal of bad stations,  but rather for the replacement of bad stations with well-sited stations, with simultaneous overlapping data collection so that biases can be both measured directly and permanently eliminated. I don’t see anything in what they are doing with Thorne that addresses this. To me, all they are doing is trying to put lipstick on a pig.
2.  Attack me without publishing an appropriate paper intended for peer review first, such as the ghost authored “Talking points” memo issued by NCDC’s Dr. Thomas Peterson, who wouldn’t put his name on it, yet circulated it to every NOAA manager and the press. If the data from these stations is so strong, and the adjustments and corrections so valid, why the cloak and dagger approach?
Note, that in the Thorne response, they carefully avoided saying anything about station siting, preferring instead to focus on data manipulations.  From my viewpoint, until they start worrying about the measurement environment in which our grand global experiment is being measured, all they are doing is rearranging data without looking at and learning from the environment and history that created it.
Perhaps they should follow the advice of the General Accounting Office report that backed up my work:
GAO-11-800 August 31, 2011, Climate Monitoring: NOAA Can Improve Management of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network Highlights Page (PDF)   Full Report (PDF, 47 pages)   Accessible Text Recommendations (HTML)
Finally, let’s spend a few moments looking at another network in the USA that doesn’t seem to suffer from the same sorts of magnitude of issues. The U.S. Population-Adjusted Temperature Dataset (PDAT) developed by Dr. Roy Spencer, which better handles UHI.
The following plot shows 12-month trailing average anomalies for the three different datasets (USHCN, CRUTem3, and ISH PDAT)…note the large differences in computed linear warming trends (click on plots for high res versions):

Where’s the warming?

"With no live sport to watch or play, exercise has never been more precious. Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter? You would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story. Some preliminary studies in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog‑standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in? We know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise – children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China; the New South Wales spinner Steve O’Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like “smoking 80 cigarettes a day”; the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn’t breathe. Not only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires. This dovetails alarmingly with the Hit for Six report published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers’ ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires’ capacity, to make decisions. Throw in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy. Add our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021. An existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer – with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet. Some might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul. But if not now, when? On Wednesday the sports sector held its own version of the Petersberg climate dialogue, a Zoom meeting organised by Basis (the British Association for Sustainable Sport) with the idea of bringing the sector together. The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward. Russell Seymour, chief executive of Basis, says: “This is not how we want to live our lives, locked down, insular. But this is the moment, the opportunity for sport to reflect and decide to rebuild its operations in a more environmentally sustainable way. After the economic crash in 2008 people said: ‘We clearly have to make a change, the current way we are living our lives isn’t working.’ Then global emissions jumped by 6% the following year. The current crisis has shown us that making changes can have a big impact and very quickly.” This is sport’s chance to evaluate properly its current plight – as some have already started to do. To embrace localism. Accept that less is more. Ask itself why. Why do the England cricket teams have to tour three countries in a winter? Why is the ICC planning to host T20 World Cups in consecutive years? Why on earth hold football’s European Championship across 12 host cities? Why must the Olympic Games move to a different city every four years? Why squeeze every drop out of athletes for maximum profit until they cannot cope and break down, both mentally or physically? Why not demand lower levels of pollution around sports grounds for the good of athletes and fans? Reset. Breathe. Who has time for sustainability now? Sport does. It has to."
"The escalating situation in Ukraine has focused the minds of Europe’s leaders on their countries’ energy needs and how to meet them. Energy security has quickly become a strategic priority for the EU, faced with the possibility of gas price rises. Political unease across Europe is understandable. Relations between Russia and Ukraine over gas supply have not been harmonious, with state-owned Russian energy firm Gazprom repeatedly threatening to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine because of unpaid debt.  President Putin has already warned Europe of gas shortages over Ukrainian debts. Cutting off Ukraine, and in doing so interrupting the supply to Western Europe, remains a powerful political tool should events escalate any further. Europe remains strongly import-dependent for energy, and Russia is hands down the largest exporter to EU member states, supplying 19.2% of coal, 24.5% of petroleum and 29.4% of natural gas. The promise of “additional and far-reaching” action from the US and Europe if Putin sends in troops to eastern Ukraine or further destabilises the region puts EU nations in danger of Russian economic retaliation. Gas supply would threaten economic recovery across Europe, and in colder regions could cost lives. Although little can be done in the short term to fix Europe’s import dependency, current events are certain to provoke a policy rethink. This is driven by three needs: to lower CO2 emissions, to keep energy costs competitive, and to maintain the security of energy supply. Together, they form a challenging triangle. Energy security itself requires a diverse supply to lessen the effects of price shocks or supply interruptions, reduced dependency on imports, and above all to keep the lights on, homes warm, and businesses running. Over-reliance on a single type of fuel, especially one sourced from volatile parts of the world, has already driven nations to try to reduce their dependency on imports. But the danger at present is that urgent steps to reduce dependency on Russian gas will be to the detriment of other energy policy priorities. An example knee-jerk reaction would be subsidising investment in new coal-fired power stations to reduce reliance on gas; such action would be a major blow against cost and carbon-reduction targets.  Even if carbon capture and storage emerges as a renewed priority for new coal plants, this solves the carbon issue at the expense of an even greater cost burden for consumers. And where would the coal come from, when Russian imports account for such a large percentage? Flexible gas power plants are viewed as the natural interim partner to the variable nature of energy generated from solar and wind – gas plants are low carbon (relative to coal), and open cycle machines can be started within minutes to meet demand when energy supply from solar and wind is insufficient (by comparison coal and nuclear cold starts can take days). For this reason EU energy policy has gravitated towards flexible gas in support of renewables, but the Ukraine situation highlights why this vision may be revisited.  Looked at another way, reducing Europe’s reliance on imported Russian gas could be viewed as a good thing for cost and decarbonisation in the long run. Doing so could reduce nations’ exposure to wholesale gas price volatility and provide strong leadership on developing domestic renewable energy. If we are to continue with the partnership of renewables backed by gas power stations then new suppliers will be needed. This points to an urgent need to quickly develop Europe’s domestic shale gas supplies, and its renewable energy resources. Power from wind, marine, solar, geothermal and biomass offer significant diversity of supply and geographic location.  Taken together they provide a supply of energy generation that is more stable and constant  than any single one alone. Ideally, they would be linked together with smartgrids, so that the windy north and sunny south of Europe can share each others’ natural resources in an interconnected EU power grid. In order to avoid going backwards and undoing the considerable progress in rolling out renewable energy generation across the continent, the EU will need to redouble its efforts to manage the problem of electricity supply variability from wind and solar – with energy storage and demand side response (altering demand to meet supply), as well as taking important steps to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency. The flashpoint of Ukraine presents a timely reminder of how much of our energy is geopolitically risky. Now is the opportunity for politicians to reassess priorities and fine-tune policies to balance cost, decarbonisation and energy security, in a world of political footballs where gas suppliers are hard to find, and even harder to keep."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"**Jersey has seen a ""surge"" of 84 new Covid-19 cases since Friday, according to the latest figures.**
This takes the island to 247 active infections, nearly three quarters of which are symptomatic.
Further public health measures and guidance are now due to follow the introduction of mandatory masks use in shops from Tuesday.
The updated government advice suggests islanders work from home where possible.
Those over the age of 70 will be advised to avoid socialising indoors with people they do not live with.
Public health officials explained the changes were needed as the island was experiencing ""complex, multiple clusters"" and a rise which cannot be attributed to a particular event.
More than 2,000 people, nearly 2% of Jersey's population, are isolating as a result of contact tracing, Chief Minister John Le Fondre confirmed.
The full list of measures to be introduced include:
Senator John Le Fondre said: ""This surge in cases is not down to one cluster.
""Health officials are seeing case clusters on a larger scale, and we are worried that the number of positive cases being picked up may indicate an increase in hospitalisation as we move forward.
""In the coming weeks we will see large numbers of returning students, family members and friends visiting for Christmas and enhanced social activity.
""Action is needed now to protect the vulnerable, to identify more cases earlier on and to slow the spread.""
Health Minister Richard Renouf said: ""If this doesn't bring down the numbers of positive cases we may, ultimately, have to move to another lockdown.""
""That's something none of us want to see,"" he added."

Today I’m going off topic to write about an explosive issue – the NSA. Spiegel has uncovered and reported explosive material that for now is only being superficially reported back in the States. Obama, and the free world, have a mega-crisis on their hands.

In Europe, especially Germany, the NSA scandal is taking on ever increasingly huge dimensions with each passing day. While the American media are pretty much low-key or even silent on the NSA scandal, in Europe it is taking on alarming dimensions and threatening to become a foreign policy catastrophe.
News magazine Spiegel has received documents revealing that NSA activity also included bugging European offices, including the Chancellor of Germany. The AP writes:
A top German official accused the United States on Sunday of using “Cold War” methods against its allies, after a German magazine cited secret intelligence documents to claim that U.S. spies bugged European Union offices. Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger was responding to a report by German news weekly Der Spiegel, which claimed that the U.S. National Security Agency eavesdropped on EU offices in Washington, New York and Brussels.”
At its English language site, Spiegel reports that the full story will be released tomorrow.
Die Welt today writes:
What is illegal for authorities and intelligence services in Germany to do, is apparently done by the US intelligence: It allegedly has spied on the communication of millions of Germans.”
Spiegel writes at its German site that:
The US intelligence services, with approval by the White House, targetedly monitored the German Government, including the Chancellor.”
Die Welt also writes that the spying is clearly shown by “a paper from the NSA from September 2010…referencing secret documents that former US intelligence agency employee Edward Snowden took with him“.

Bild daily  writes:
The statistics that Spiegel had seen shows that on normal days up to 20 million telephone connections and up to 10 million internet data sets had been monitored. On Christmas Eve 2012 the Americans checked over and saved 13 million telephone connections and half as much data from internet connections.
On peak days, such as 7 January 2013, the intelligence agencies spied on about 60 million telephone connections. As a comparision, for France the Americans in the same time period recorded about two million connections.”
The Spiegel revelations are developing into a major and highly embarrassing scandal for Washington. While the news is spreading like a firestorm in a tinderbox in Germany, reports from US media have had their volume turned down to almost mute levels.
Spiegel, which broke the story yesterday, reports today that the German Justice Department has filed charges against “unknown perpetrators“. The German news magazine writes:
The espionage affair surrounding the American intelligence agency NSA has now reached the German Prosecutor’s Office. The authority based in Karlsruhe is responsible for investigating criminal acts against internal security and, according to SPIEGEL information, is checking to see whether violations of privacy laws have been committed during the systematic surveillance of German citizens. … The NSA scandal has now become a matter for the German Justice Department.”
Washington’s and London’s relationship with mainland Europe is now so damaged that they are being compared to the Cold War. This is not a foreign policy scandal, rather it is a foreign policy debacle of historical proportions.
In today’s report, Spiegel writes:
According to an internal statistic of the NSA, approximately 500 million communication connections are monitored. The NSA has ranked Germany as a target of attack.”
According to Spiegel, all this is based on “material whistleblower Edward Snowden collected“.
One can only speculate what information Spiegel has received. But so far everything points to the acquisition of huge trove of intelligence information. I suspect this is only the tip of the ice berg and we are going to be seeing a lot more from Spiegel in the days and weeks ahead. “Foreign policy debacle of historical proportions” may be an understatement.

"**A-levels and GCSEs in England are due to go ahead next summer, with the exam season starting three weeks later than usual.**
Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week.
So what are the options for making exams fair when many teenagers have missed out on schooling due to the Covid-19 pandemic?
Socially distanced exams have already had a trial run with GCSE resits in further education colleges in England in November.
It was a big task, with colleges emptying out their buildings so they had enough space to set out for the exams.
While tens of thousands of students were resitting maths and English exams, the summer exams are taken by hundreds of thousands.
But the autumn retakes have shown that exams can happen in difficult circumstances, albeit on a much smaller scale.
By early summer it's also possible that rapid testing, of the kind being used at universities, could be targeted at any remaining areas of high transmission.
This is expected to happen.
In summer 2020, grades based largely on teacher assessment jumped up - 78.8% of GCSEs were grade 4 or above compared to 69.9% in 2019.
Top grades in A-levels went up too.
So will it be back down with a bump this year with exams? That would cause an outcry, because all students have missed out to different degrees.
The exams regulator Ofqual has already said the ""baleful"" impact of the pandemic on some students means it doesn't want to drive grades back down to pre-pandemic levels.
Giving schools some advance warning of which topics are coming up is already in place for some subjects - and that could increase.
Advance warning could be given of the main topics for exams, so schools can use the time between now and the exams to best prepare students.
There are different ways this could be done, from identifying texts to slightly narrowing down the content.
The scope of the exams has already been reduced in GCSE English literature, history and ancient history.
For example, a pupil would have to answer on a Shakespeare play and then two out of three optional areas in English literature papers.
The difficulty of extending this is it risks further increasing the advantage for teenagers who have faced little disruption due to Covid-19 since September.
But it would help schools focus their efforts over the next few months.
This is one of the suggestions backed by the Labour Party and has gained interest from some head teachers.
But it's an idea that's been sliding down the popularity scale.
It would mean putting more choice of questions on exam papers, so students could answer on what their school had managed to cover.
It's a form of optionality.
However, research has suggested that it can make exam papers more confusing to navigate, which ends up favouring the academically stronger pupils.
This is the biggest headache - hard to fix fairly and potentially politically tricky too.
Secondary school attendance has fallen dramatically to below 70% of pupils in some areas.
Parts of North West England have been badly affected, and some schools in Kent are feeling the impact now.
The Labour Party has called for regional adjustment of exam results.
That wouldn't take account of highly localised differences, with some schools - even within the same areas - being differently affected, and for that reason it is unlikely.
But there will be pressure to find a way of recognising the lost learning.
This is unlikely to be done officially, which could risk leaving students carrying a qualification into their future that marks them out as different.
Schools are likely to help students plead special circumstances so they can progress to college, apprenticeships or university.
Already two universities have said they will accept one grade lower in recognition of the disruption this year.
There could be more than one solution to the issue of students missing exams.
Every year some students miss exams because of illness, accidents or a family tragedy.
There is a process to deal with these ""special considerations"" which could be used for individual students.
It can involve using data from another paper in the same subject and teacher assessment.
But what if a bigger group of teenagers miss out on crucial exams?
A contingency series of exams at a slightly later date is likely, so that anyone who needs to go on to the next stage isn't held up waiting for autumn.
A-levels and GCSE exams in Wales have already been cancelled.
Nationals in Scotland have also been cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers will be taken, two weeks later than usual.
In Northern Ireland, GCSEs and A-levels will go ahead, but will start a week later than usual."

Hurricane season is here again, and the good people at the National Hurricane Center are predicting a 70% chance of more activity than normal this year. I’m predicting a greater than 99.9% probability that this season’s windbags will be conflated with global warming.



We can look forward to another year of numbing hurricane hype. Tropical cyclones (the generic for hurricanes, typhoons, willi‐​willies, etc…) are the sexiest weather beasts on TV, with seductive eyes surrounded by towering _cumulonimbi_. A category 3 (out of 5) storm within a week’s distance from the East Coast commands 24/7 attention from The Weather Channel and at least 50% of CNN’s time. Given that storms get this close (or closer) a couple of times every year, the coverage seems a bit out of proportion.



It’s part of our culture. Hurricanes became media stars when Dan Rather, a cub reporter from Houston, convinced CBS headquarters in 1961 to add 15 minutes to the (then) 15 minutes of network news featuring — surprise — him, braving the Galveston Seawall while big, bad Hurricane Carla languorously eyed the Texas Coast. While there’s still debate about whether Carla may have actually been more powerful than 2005’s legendary Katrina, it is certainly true that she made Dan a rather big man.



So this year is supposed to be another big one. The planetary surface temperature is warmer than it was back in Carla’s day. Aren’t these two things related?



Hurricanes long since graduated from being singular weather events to becoming climatic signposts. After all, it seems pretty logical that they should be enhanced by global warming, as the thermal source that they convert to destructive kinetic energy is the heat of the ocean, which should go up with the surface temperature.



Tropical cyclones are a bit more complicated than “warmer ocean in, bigger hurricane out”. For months on end, the vast majority of the earth’s tropical oceans sport surface temperatures above 80°F, the threshold required for their formation. Given this massive amount of suitable ocean surface, why are there so few hurricanes? And why would warming of a degree or two really change this?



Under global warming, it turns out that the threshold temperature goes up too. A report published last November in _Nature Geoscience_ found a rise of about 0.5 degrees in that temperature in recent decades paralleling the observed rise in tropical ocean surface temperatures. Everything else being equal (which never occurs), this would mean no increase in hurricane frequency and intensity.



For over a decade, federal climatologist Kevin Trenberth has claimed that global warming will increase the frequency and strength of El Niño, the large periodic warming of the tropical Pacific. One of the few sure things about hurricane climatology is that Los Niños destroy Atlantic storms as they unfavorably shift the winds aloft.



The global warming‐​hurricane war has been raging in the scientific literature for over a decade. One of the major battles is over the quality of historical data, and whether or not hurricane statistics are being inflated by nonclimatic forces.



A few years ago I began to notice that cloud blobs of decidedly unseductive proportions began to be named as tropical cyclones.



While I’ve published some papers in the scientific literature on hurricanes and climate change, I never figured how to test that surmise. To my surprise, two weeks ago, my hypothesis was tested in a paper in _Journal of Geophysical Research,_ and it appears to be supportable. The paper shows that there has been no increase whatsoever in the number of Atlantic storms that last more than 48 hours. There has been a major increase in the number of short‐​lived storms; i.e. ones which the Hurricane Center wouldn’t have named decades ago.



On reason is because we have learned that even relatively weak tropical storms can produce extreme floods. People began to pay attention to this in 1979, when tropical storm Claudette drowned Alvin, in southeast Texas, under 45 inches of rain. In 1994, weak tropical storm Alberto killed 33 in the southeast, largely a result of over two feet of rain. Tropical storm Allison, in 2001, dropped 40 inches, again in southeast Texas.



While slightly warmer oceans should slightly enhance rainfall from tropical cyclones, all the refereed research out there indicates that such an effect won’t be detectable for decades, in part a result of the obviously great variability that exists in rainfall from these storms.



So we can go back and forth on whether or not hurricanes are getting worse because of global warming. But while we debate, nature adjudicates.



Ryan Maue at Florida State University has been tracking hurricane power over the years. That’s the square of the maximum wind speed summed over the lifetime of each storm. His results tell you everything you need to know:





Maue’s hurricane power index shows that current values are near the lowest ever measured, both in our hemisphere (black dots) and globally (blue dots), and exhibit no overall trend, effectively blowing any linkage between recent storms and global warming out of the water.



Both globally and in our hemisphere, total hurricane power is at or near the lowest it has ever been measured. So much for Hurricane hype.

By now, everyone who isn’t a complete idiot or a blind eco-fanatic (is there a difference?) knows that the “Amazon is burning!” panic is a thoroughgoing lie. Not that you can rely on the so-called “fact-checkers” of the left-wing media to come clean about that.



But the truth really is inconvenient to the green-left. If everyone acknowledged the truth about the global environment (it’s not perfect, but it’s doing pretty well, and way better than it used to be), the donations would stop rolling in and the left would be shorn of much of their power.



I sometimes wonder if the line wrongly attributed to Mark Twain, ‘a lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on’, is now taken as an instruction by environmental pressure groups. They operate in a viciously competitive market for media attention and donations, and those who scream loudest do best, even if it later turns out they were telling fibs.



As Michael Crichton’s _State of Fear_ argues, the media and the green-left (again – **is there a difference?** ) have a vested interest in creating spurious panics, in defiance of plain fact.



Around the world, wild fires are generally declining, according to Nasa. Deforestation, too, is happening less and less.



Or even reversing.



A study in _Nature_ last year by scientists from the University of Maryland concluded that […] ‘contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally — tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1 per cent relative to the 1982 level).’



[…]Possibly the biggest driver of this encouraging trend is the rising productivity of agriculture. The more yields increase, the less land we need to steal from nature to feed ourselves. Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University has calculated that the world needs only 35 per cent as much land to produce a given quantity of food as 50 years ago. That has spared wild land on a massive scale.



Environmentalists’ lies have real consequences, beyond lining the pockets of quangos and shoring up political careers. Some years ago, I interviewed the CEO of a company proposing to operate a big, scary “super-trawler” in Tasmanian waters. He was adamant that they had bent over backwards to deal with environmental issues, and that all had been going swimmingly – until a global e-ngo stepped in. The proposal was scrapped. Yet, now fish stocks such as flathead are threatened in Tasmanian waters – but from recreational, not commercial fishing. The very people who were hoodwinked by environmentalists into fiercely campaigning against the trawler are themselves responsible for largely uncontrolled over-fishing.



It may seem paradoxical, but often the commercial exploitation of a resource is the very thing that preserves it – and contributes the most to human well-being.



Likewise, getting people on to fossil fuels and away from burning wood for fuel spares trees. It is in the poorest countries, mainly in Africa, that men and women still gather firewood for cooking and bushmeat for food, instead of using electricity or gas and farmed meat.



Environmentalism is adamantly opposed to it all. Forests that were being replenished are being cut down again, as fossil fuels are replaced with “biofuels” (a fancy euphemism for “burning plants”).



The obsession with climate change has slowed the decline of deforestation. An estimated 700,000 hectares of forest has been felled in South-East Asia to grow palm oil to add to supposedly green ‘bio-diesel’ fuel in Europe, while the world is feeding 5 per cent of its grain crop to motor cars rather than people, which means 5 per cent of cultivated land that could be released for forest. Britain imports timber from wild forests in the Americas to burn for electricity at Drax in North Yorkshire, depriving beetles and woodpeckers of their lunch.



There is a human cost, too: poor farmers and herdsmen in Africa and South America are [being driven off their lands](https://www.grain.org/e/4653), often violently, to make way for biofuel plantations.



The temptation to moralise on social media is so strong among footballers, actors and politicians alike that it is actually doing harm. Get the economic incentives right and the world will save its forests. Preach and preen and prevaricate, and you’ll probably end up inadvertently depriving more toucans and tapirs of their rainforest habitat.

Jacinda Ardern got off on the wrong foot at Tuvalu, the theme this year is _“Securing our Future in the Pacific”_ which, as you will have guessed, is primarily about climate change and how much money will change hands to address it.



Ardern did not hold back from raising her colours at Tuvalu and insulting Scott Morrison to boot. 



**Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing hard-hitting questions from New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern** as the leaders meet at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. 



Ms Ardern has challenged the Prime Minister to explain Australia’s position on climate change with the subject taking centre stage at the regional conference, and **accusations Australia is not doing enough.** ”



  
Sky News reporters in Australia were quick to point to Ardern’s trolling of Scott Morrison, asking who she thought she was to throw her weight around when both countries have similar Kyoto targets.



They said the idea that **“Australia is somehow a climate sinner while NZ is a bunch of climate saints” does not stack up** ; and it is **“not helpful for Ardern to be splitting the Pacific nations when we should be working together to counter Chinese influence in our region** ”.



Aaah, yes, the Chinese. Sky News recollected Ardern walking away from media recently instead of answering the hard question about the Chinese in Hong Kong. 



“ **Jacinda Ardern always gets this sort of halo around her but then when you start to look more deeply at it, it doesn’t hold up.**



And just on the China thing, there has been a lot of concern around Chinese influence in NZ and in fact **Jacinda Ardern even walked out of one of her own press conferences some weeks ago when she was trying to be drawn on the Hong Kong demonstrators** and giving any support to their mission in Hong Kong.”



  
Ardern’s halo has slipped in Australia but she also came up short on climate change at Tuvalu.



“Ms Ardern said it’s very fitting to have a nation like Tuvalu hosting this year’s forum.



At the last Pacific Islands Forum climate change was a significant topic, in fact, **it was identified by the forum as the biggest threat facing the Pacific.**



So, to now hold a forum on an island where **climate change is not a theoretical proposition but is very much a reality** **and a visual reality I think will be quite pointed** ,” she said.”



  
Ardern is still pushing her political narrative but she is well out of date because scientists have moved on. **While sea levels at Tuvalu are rising the land area of Tuvalu has increased**. 



The tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, thought to be under threat from sea level rise, **has actually expanded in land area over the past 40 years and is likely to continue to be habitable a century from now, scientists say.**



 **New research from the University of Auckland** published in Nature Communications mapped shoreline change of each of Tuvalu’s 101 islands across its nine atolls over a 40-year period. 



  
But why aren’t scientists concerned about Tuvalu’s rising sea levels?



“The **sea level at the Funafuti** tide gauge has risen at 3.9 mm per year, which is **approximately twice the global average**. 



Tuvalu **could** be one of the first nations to experience the effects of [sea level rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise). “



  
Tuvalu is not unique in that **all tides in the western Pacific are rising at double the expected rate** but the science is by no means settled on the reasons why.



“Measuring ongoing sea global level rise, which results from the global warming-induced melting of land ice and thermal expansion, **is a complicated business.**



This **comparatively small long-term rise** is often obscured because sea level can undergo large up-and-down fluctuations over seasonal, annual, and even decade-long time scales. 



**This is especially true in the case of the islands of the western Pacific where the ENSO cycles**[ **El Niño**](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/elnino/el-nino-story.html) **and**[ **La Niña**](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/elnino/la-nina-story.html) **result in** **sea level fluctuations up to 20-30 cms** , which is around 40-60 times larger than the long-term annual increase (5.1mm) found at Tuvalu. Quite obviously these fluctuations have to be accounted for in order to see the underlying long-term trend. 



The tide gauge and satellite altimatry data both have their own shortcomings, for example the tide gauges have long records, but some are plagued by data gaps, and monitoring equipment that has been updated over time. 



Also, tide gauges are fixed to the seafloor, which can either be sinking or rising dependent on the location (hence the use of co-located GPS equipment at some sites), so that has to be factored in to observations too.” 



  
Tuvalu disappearing underwater in the next decade does not line up with the latest science, but there are political mileage and good money to had from climate change so Ardern keeps the spin going – but not, I suspect, for the benefit of Tuvalu.

"Carbon capture and storage is a hot topic among researchers striving to save the planet from climate change. Scientists are constantly trying to develop and improve materials which can capture carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. At the Energy Safety Research Institute (ESRI) at Swansea University, we’ve developed a promising new material from a liquid amine - a chemical which is known for its ability to react with CO₂, but in liquid form can’t do so effectively. By adding just enough glue to make the liquid amine fluff up into a solid, the resulting new material is capable of capturing one-fifth of its own weight in CO₂. The glue is a type of epoxy resin – used everywhere in paints, varnishes and flooring. Our work shows that epoxy resins can be a key ingredient in making effective carbon capture materials – and they have been staring us in the face for more than 70 years. Since huge advances are being made in renewable energy – and the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels has reduced – is carbon capture technology becoming redundant? Unfortunately not. There remains about 1.5 times the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere that there was in pre-industrial times. If we are to limit global warming to 1.5°C to avert the worst consequences of climate change, atmospheric CO₂ will have to be captured on an industrial scale, and either made into useful new chemicals or buried deep underground in depleted oil reservoirs.

      COP24: here's what must be agreed to keep warming at 1.5°C


 For all the damage it’s causing, CO₂ actually makes up only 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume, making it very hard to extract directly from the air, which is the ultimate challenge. Our work was focused primarily on capturing CO₂ before it leaves smoke stacks at power stations where CO₂ concentrations range from 8-15% and temperatures can be between 40 and 100°C.  Power stations around the world will continue to burn fossil fuels until clean energy technologies are ready to fully replace coal and gas-based energy production, so their emissions have to be reduced as soon as possible. Industrial processes that carry out CO₂ capture currently use liquid amines, but this technology comes with problems. It’s very expensive, not very efficient and the chemicals are highly corrosive and toxic to the environment. This is why we need something better which can match the scale of this problem. So what’s special about this new glue-assisted CO₂ sponge? It’s a polymer made mostly from liquid amines which bind CO₂, and epoxy resin glue. We showed that the glue molecules stick the liquid amine molecules together into one solid mass. Being a solid makes it easier and safer to handle and much cheaper to reuse, compared to the current carbon capture materials which are liquid. The epoxy resin is also cheap and widely produced. When this and the liquid amine are combined, the solid material that forms is very effective at capturing CO₂. One variant was found capable of capturing almost 20% of its weight in pure CO₂ at 90°C. This was a good indication that we had made a material that could suck up a lot of CO₂. But in the conditions of a smoke stack, the material would be exposed to a mixture of gases and would have to exclusively capture CO₂. We ran an experiment to see if it would take up nitrogen (N₂) – the most abundant gas in Earth’s atmosphere – but it didn’t, confirming that the material selectively binds CO₂. We next wanted to test the material’s ability to capture CO₂ under the replicated conditions of the smoke stack. We tested the material with a stream of gas that was 10% CO₂ and 90% N₂ at 90°C. Once CO₂ was captured, the temperature was increased to 155°C to remove the captured CO₂ and regenerate the material so that it could be used again. The material captured 9.5% of its weight in CO₂ over 29 successive cycles – a pretty good performance for a material that would have to work constantly to capture and release CO₂ within a smoke stack. The next test of this material’s performance was its ability to capture CO₂ under humid conditions as water is present in gas from a smoke stack. Humidity often causes solid CO₂ capture materials to perform badly as they suck up water instead of CO₂. But rather than hinder uptake, water actually helped this material capture more CO₂. Under humid conditions and at only 25°C, the CO₂ uptake from pure CO₂ was a huge 23.5%. This bodes well for one day capturing CO₂ directly from air. This material could be the next generation in solid carbon capture materials. Glue: common, cheap and abundant, could yet find a new and valuable role in the fight against climate change.

"One of the most powerful tropical storms ever recorded, Typhoon Haiyan rampaged across the central Philippines in 2013, causing the deaths of more than 7,000 people. The devastating consequences were not simply the result of a 7.5 metre “storm surge” but also down to the fact that few people actually knew what it meant when there were warnings of the phenomenon, and the threat it posed to the population. Storm surge does not occur as inland flooding caused by heavy rainfall, or as coastal flooding that occurs any time low-lying land is inundated by seawater. Storm surge is an abnormal rise in water levels over the estimated high tide. Simply put, it is ocean water forced by powerful hurricane winds towards the coast. Such hurricane-force winds are always hazardous to coastal communities and infrastructure, but often the most devastating consequences for local populations are due to storm surge.  Storm surges are unique in their characteristics, because of their high sensitivity to the slightest change in storm parameters such as speed, pressure, intensity, direction of approach, position of the coast or the depth of the ocean. Storm parameters tend to change rapidly during the lifecycle of a hurricane, increasing uncertainty around storm surge water levels. Despite being regarded as a secondary hazard, storm surge often poses more of a threat than strong hurricane winds, usually regarded as the primary hazard. Coastal areas are largely altered by various other factors such as erosion and depletion of storm buffers such as reefs, wetlands and salt marshes through day-to-day interaction with the dynamics of the sea. So the coastline is constantly changing, making it more vulnerable and paving the way for new inundation levels from the next storm surge. Sometimes storm surge is confused with tsunamis (as both involve a wall of water rushing towards the coastline), or storm tides, which are a combination of storm surge and tide over and above the normal water level. Both phenomena result in coastal inundations and can cause substantial loss of life and economic damage. Tsunamis can be seismic, meaning they can result from the vibrations of the Earth such as earthquakes, or non-seismic – caused by phenomena such as meteorites or asteroids. But storm surge is only associated with tropical or extra-tropical cyclones where heavy winds trigger the abnormal rise in water levels. A typical effect of a tsunami is the receding of the sea – identified during the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004 – before it banks up  to create a huge wall of water. This was also witnessed during Hurricane Irma in 2017, when the storm exhibited a “negative storm surge effect”. This happens when seawater is sucked away from the shore uncovering the seabed or leaving it in a dry state. A study from 2018 claimed that the death rate from storm surges is decreasing thanks to improved forecasting technologies, early warning systems, coastal protections and speedy evacuations. However, recent storms like Cyclone Idai remind us that storm surge has not gone away. Counting deaths attributed to storm surge over a period of time seems to give a misleading picture of reduced impact, plus signs of a decreasing trend may not indicate the actual risks associated with storm surge.   In 2018, Edward Rappaport, acting director of the US’s National Hurricane Center, carried out an analysis on direct deaths from Atlantic tropical cyclones over three decades from 1970-1999. His study recorded that most of cyclone-related fatalities were associated with rainfall and not attributable to storm surges. The 1,800 deaths from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and significant economic damage that occurred during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, majorly altered his claim, and he later reported that 49% of deaths from Atlantic hurricanes are directly associated with storm surge. The increase in tropical cyclone-generated storm surges that occurred around the world between 2015 and 2018 and the human and economic cost that resulted, clearly contradicts any claim that death rates from storm surges are decreasing. During the course of Cyclone Idai, which struck Zimbabwe and the coast of Mozambique on March 14, 2019, mud houses were washed away and sea defences were damaged. Towns were cut off from rescue operations, and the death toll exceeded 800 people with hundreds reported missing. Winds of up to 177kmph (106mph) resulted in 90% of the city of Beira in Mozambique being destroyed. With airports closed, rescuers could only reach survivors by land, which not only protracted the rescue process but also complicated the deployment of food, water and emergency medical services. This is what typically happens when a storm surge hits. Cyclone Idai is a deadly example of the power of a storm surge, and the cities in its path are still recovering from the impact, with the death toll expected to exceed 1,000. This would certainly indicate that storm surge is not a declining trend. Which is all the more reason to help people in vulnerable parts of the world to understand what storm surge is and just how much a threat to life it can be."
"Looking at the countryside now in the middle of summer, it is hard to believe that trees are under threat from an array of diseases and pests. Warm and wet conditions with plenty of sunshine have led to an verdant explosion of plant growth. After news of the spread of ash dieback across the UK many people may be surprised to see ash trees in Britain coming into leaf at all, but tree diseases are not necessarily as quick as media hyperbole might suggest. It can take years for a mature tree to succumb to disease, but once the pathogenic fungus, bacteria or virus takes hold then while the end may be slow, it’s also virtually inevitable. At the recent Cheltenham Science Festival, I was joined by three leading UK experts in tree disease: Professor Steve Woodward from the University of Aberdeen, Dr Ruth Mitchell from the James Hutton Institute and Dr Richard Buggs from Queen Mary University of London. Ash dieback was at the forefront of the audience’s concerns, with many reporting seemingly healthy ash trees in their back gardens.  Ash dieback is a suite of disease symptoms caused by a fungus, and trying to piece together the life cycle, history and ecology of this fungus has not been easy. As Steve Woodward explained: “What we now know is that the fungus causing ash dieback jumped species to infect European ash. It occurs naturally in a species of ash native to Asia where, like a similar fungus in European ash, it causes no problems. The global trade in trees and greater planting of ornamental and commercial species (ash counts as both) with little regard for quarantine probably helped bring these species together, allowing the fungus to infect European ash.” As is common in cases where species move to new hosts, the new host had no defences against the fungus. It spread rapidly across Europe to the UK, killing most of the ash trees it infected. The situation is so bad in Northern Europe that trees with some natural tolerance to the fungus – a great example of natural selection in action – are rare enough to become known as individuals, for example Tree 35 in Denmark.  But is this a big problem for the UK: are ash trees an important component of our biodiversity? I put the question to Ruth Mitchell, who was clear on the wider implications of ash dieback. “Losing ash trees will really matter. It is one of our most common trees and there are at least 45 species such as moths, beetles and butterflies that only use ash, another 62 species that predominately use them, and a total of nearly 1,000 species that can be found using ash. That is a lot of species directly affected, and many more will be indirectly affected through various complex interactions.”  Worryingly, it’s only since ash dieback hit Britain that this research has got underway, and the species associated with other trees are only poorly known. Ash dieback may be the current pin-up of the tree disease world, but there are plenty of other diseases threatening our trees. Acute oak decline, chestnut blight and various Phytophthora fungi responsible for brown rot are among the microorganisms causing disease. There are also Asian longhorn beetles, horse chestnut leaf miner and oak processionary moth to contend with in terms of insects causing problems. Ash doesn’t escape insect pests either, with the Emerald Ash Borer spreading west from Russia. With so many threats either already here or on the horizon, is there anything we can do? As Richard Buggs explained: “It is probably already too late for ash in the UK but we can use genetic research to develop a strong genetically-diverse base of tolerant trees to re-plant Britain in the future.” The answers to tree disease aren’t just in the science. “There is a huge movement of plants across the world, and when plants move you also move diseases, pests and goodness knows what else living in the soil they’re transported in. We need better biosecurity controls over this movement,” says Steve Woodward.  The overwhelming conclusion of the panel was one that will be familiar to ecologists everywhere: the situation is complicated and we don’t know anywhere near enough about the diseases or their implications. One thing is clear though. We shouldn’t let the relatively slow pace of tree diseases (which take years rather than weeks to take hold) dictate our research efforts to combat them."

To: Dr. Roger Wakimoto



Director, National Center for Atmospheric Research



Boulder, Colorado



Roger, you are the head of what is perhaps the most prestigious atmospheric science laboratory on the planet, and, as such, I presume that you will always go the extra mile to protect the reputation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and its related University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).



I’m sure you have seen and discussed with your staff many of the “Climategate” emails released first in November, 2009, and then more recently, earlier this month.



Everyone agrees that the tone and content of many of them is a bit shrill and occasionally intolerant (kind of like University faculty meetings), but there is one repeating thread, by one of your most prestigious employees, Dr. Tom Wigley, that is far beyond the pale of most academic backbiting.



The revoking of my doctorate, the clear objective of Tom’s email, is the professional equivalent of the death penalty. I think it needs to be brought to your attention, because the basic premise underlying his machinations is patently and completely false. Dr Wigley is known as a careful scientist, but he certainly was careless here.



The global circulation of this email has caused unknown damage to my reputation. Also, please note that all communications from Dr. Wigley to his colleagues on this matter were on the NCAR/UCAR server.



The relevant email was sent to Rick Piltz, a UCAR employee at the time, and copied to Michael Mann, Pennsylvania State University, James Hansen and Gavin Schmidt, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Benjamin Santer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,the late Steven Schneider, Stanford University, and several other very prominent climate scientists. The influence of these individuals is manifest and evidence of a very serious attempt to destroy my credential.



What Dr. Wigley wrote to this group of individuals was:



“You may be interesting [sic] in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?”



As I said, revoking the doctorate of a scientist is the equivalent of imposing a professional death penalty. Unfortunately, Wigley’s rationale for organizing this effort was based upon a pure fabrication.



Wigley’s call for a “re‐​assessing” of my dissertation stems from his contention that I either misled my academic committee or my committee was guilty of professional malfeasance, both very serious charges. (His email is reproduced in its entirety at the end of this note.)



My 1979 dissertation was a model relating interannual and interseasonal variations in the shape of the atmosphere, as reflected by the surface barometric pressure field, to variations crop yields across the United States.



In this type of model, one usually factors out the technological component of crop yields (which, incidentally, explains much more variation than any climate component) and then models the remaining variation in yield with the climate factor, in order to “isolate” the climate component. The explained variance of this residual yield by climate is generally about 50%, which is very close to the average I found for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat.



Wigley said in his email that I claimed to have explained 95% of the variation in crop yield, which he said “would have been a remarkable results” [sic]. In fact, there is no such statement, nor anything related to that, in my dissertation. He went on to state that I did this by simultaneously modelling the technological, spatial and climate components of agricultural yield, instead of separating out technological components first.



Despite his claimed familiarity with my dissertation, I did no such thing. Table 2, beginning on page 154 of the dissertation, is labelled “DETRENDING FUNCTIONS”, and gives the equations that were used to remove the technological component. All subsequent analyses were on the detrended data.



Wigley then alleged that either I lied to my examination committee, or that they were buffoons. It is worth noting that the committee included the famously tough Reid Bryson, father of the modern notion that human beings could change the climate.



“Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.”



This came to my attention with the release of the first East Anglia emails in November, 2009. This email and other, new statements by him about my dissertation have surfaced with the recent release of additional emails, and his letter about my dissertation is again being circulated around the web.



I think you will agree that it is time for Dr. Wigley to state that his attempt to generate a movement to remove my doctorate was based upon clear errors on his part, errors that he should have known about, and yet he has let the record stand for over two years. What he “discovered years ago” was certainly not in my dissertation.



Roger, I don’t think you would put up with this, and I think Wigley must be compelled to come forth. Remember that he did this on NCAR’s (and the taxpayer’s) dime.



Thank you very much.

Dear folks,



You may be interesting in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?



Michaels’ PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt with statistical (regression‐​based) modeling of crop‐​climate relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical model showed that weather/​climate variations could explain 95% of the inter‐​annual variability in crop yields. Had this been correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it was at odds with all previous studies of crop‐​climate relationships, which generally showed that weather/​climate could only explain about 50% of inter‐​annual yield variability.



How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels’ regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability, so that, in Michaels’ regressions, weather/​climate explains just 5 of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels’ claim that weather/​climate explains 95% of the variability is completely bogus.



Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.



As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop‐​climate modeling. We used a spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.



Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983: Crop‐​climate modelling using spatial patterns of yield and climate: Part 1, Background and an example from Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.



There never was a “Part 2.”

"**Qantas will outsource more than 2,000 ground staff roles in an effort to limit its financial losses.**
The job cuts are on top of 6,000 roles already announced by Australiaâs flag carrier earlier this year.
Qantas announced a $2bn (Â£1bn) loss in August due to Covid-19 and associated border restrictions.
âUnfortunately, Covid has turned aviation upside down,"" said Andrew David, the airlineâs domestic and international chief executive.
""Airlines around the world are having to make dramatic decisions in order to survive and the damage will take years to repair,â he added.
Qantas hopes to save about $74m annually, based on pre-Covid levels of flying, by switching to third-party providers instead of handling its own ground services.
It also expects to save $59m over five years by avoiding new spending on ground handling equipment such as aircraft tugs and baggage loaders.
Affected employees will be entitled to a redundancy package and given support to transition to new jobs, the airline said.
There has been some good news for the airlineâs recovery, with domestic routes starting to recover as state governments lift interstate travel restrictions.
But Qantas is still predicting bleak times ahead, with more losses next year due to a drop in revenue of $7.4bn.
It does not expect to fly internationally until late in 2021 - with the exception of a potential travel bubble with New Zealand.
The airline has also taken on an additional $1.1bn debt in order to keep operating.
Itâs not alone. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts airlines globally are on course to lose $157bn this year and next.
Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8bn this year from 4.5bn in 2019.
IATA says those numbers will recover only partially to 2.8bn next year."
"After increasingly stark scientific warnings and unprecedented mass mobilisations of school children and rebellious citizens, the climate crisis is finally starting to be acknowledged in the halls of decision making. The UK has now committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, mirroring momentum in France and the rest of the EU for similar targets. But there’s a long way to go yet. Government targets to date still vastly underestimate the urgency of the climate crisis. And in terms of concrete action, the world is way off; based on current policy plans, the science indicates that we’re heading for a world that will be three to four degrees hotter by 2100. As the source of much of the very research that has alerted us to the true scale of the crisis we face, it is up to universities to take the lead in showing society how to act on it. If they don’t, then how can they justify taxpayers funding the research in the first place? Such leadership starts with rallying behind a zero carbon target that takes climate breakdown seriously. The UN recently released a key report on the catastrophic effects of letting global heating rise above 1.5℃ – in which university academics played a major role. But according to the report, aiming for net zero by 2050 still gives us a 50% chance of temperatures rising above this dangerous level. And even this risky percentage is based on the whole world going zero carbon by this date. To address the murky economic injustice of climate breakdown, countries that have long benefited from exploiting the fossil fuel resources of poorer countries need to decarbonise much sooner than 2050. As privileged institutions facing pressure to confront colonial biases, universities in these countries should champion a zero carbon target of 2035. Such a target would both respect the severity of their own scientific findings, and allow those who have suffered from oily geopolitics to decarbonise at a slower pace. In fact, some already have set targets of 2035 or earlier – but that doesn’t mean that their job is done. Universities, like governments, are guilty of creative carbon accounting that diminishes the true value of even seemingly impressive targets. In reporting only emissions from fuels burnt on site, and electricity and heat utility bills, most paint an incomplete picture of their full emissions burden. Universities must create a culture of honest accounting by including the hefty carbon costs of areas such as travel and transport (often accounting for more than a quarter of universities’ emissions) and food, and then set about reducing them. This means spending money directly on reducing emissions, and avoiding the use of popular carbon offsets, which palm off emissions reductions to poorer, low-emitting countries. Some universities have already claimed to be “carbon neutral” or close to it, but their substantial use of offsets in reality reveals a prioritisation of green branding over concrete action. Evidence from academics indicates that offsets almost never actually reduce emissions, and may in some cases be worse than doing nothing. Universities must therefore focus efforts on achieving real zero, not net zero. Unlike industries such as steel, cement and aviation, which are difficult to decarbonise, the vast majority of university emissions are relatively easy to cut.  Switching to genuinely renewable energy as well as systematically implementing energy-saving measures such as heat pumps and insulation can slash energy use. Frequent air travel for conferences and field trips is clearly inconsistent with decarbonisation, and there is no excuse for universities not to replace travel with remote participation wherever possible, and support slower, less polluting options where necessary. Taking beef and lamb off the university menu is also an important and urgent step. As hubs of scientific innovation, universities must also redouble efforts to find new ways of decarbonising – and, importantly, integrate these efforts with the local communities they are often so intimately linked to. Creating new economies and ways of living will be essential in the journey to zero emissions, and projects such as the Place-based Action Network have already begun to show how local cooperation can build an inclusive and coordinated path away from fossil fuels. To ensure broad buy in to what will inevitably be tough changes ahead, universities must actively engage with and listen to these communities, as well as staff and students at all levels. Universities are not just innovators but educators too, and have a vital role in ensuring that when students and staff leave university they’re less likely to exacerbate the climate crisis, not more – no matter what they study or teach. Finally, universities must fully and unconditionally divest from all fossil fuels. Despite widespread support for divestment among staff, UK and US universities alone have billions of pounds still invested in the industry. Continued support for fossil fuel companies is not compatible with the climate emergency that academic research has illuminated – and universities would do well to question whether maintaining research ties or student placements with such companies is either.  I am proud to be a part of a network of institutions with a long history of using research to create a better world. But as the world faces its gravest existential threat, these institutions urgently need to marry words with action. Anything less undermines the integrity of their work. Without the work of universities, we would not have been awakened to the climate emergency. If even they then ignore the teachings of their research, how on Earth can we expect anyone else to act?

Ah, summer in our cities, where the climate is woebegone and the temperature is almost always above normal.



Cities tend to get warmer, whether or not there is global or regional warming. Bricks, buildings and pavement absorb more heat during the day than a “natural” vegetated state, and urban structures impede the flow of ventilating winds. The result is that, as cities grow, temperatures rise. In Washington, there is additional warming caused by the waste heat from all the money changing hands.



The official (and silly) definition of “normal” temperature is the average for the past 30 years. In a growing urban environment (which includes suburban sprawl) that number is likely to be lower than what it is now.



As a result, cities are inadvertently testing a dear hypothesis of my greener friends: that global warming will result in increasing heat‐​related mortality.



Those who have read _Freakonomics_ can see this hanging curveball. Global warming should _reduce_ urban mortality as heat waves become more frequent.



I’ve done a bit of work in this area. Robert Davis, a former colleague at the University of Virginia, and I examined three decades of heat‐​related mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control for the 28 largest U.S. cities. We then teamed up with a UVa medical statistician, Wendy Novicoff, who made sure we adjusted for different demographics between cities; we did this because the elderly and infants are most susceptible to heat‐​related mortality, and we wanted to compare disproportionately old cities (like Phoenix) with disproportionally young ones (like Seattle). After all was said and done, we found that heat‐​related mortality is dropping like a stone in almost every major urban area in the nation.



Before you go to the “comments” and blast me with the European heat wave of 2003 or the Chicago disaster in 1995, read on.



The 2003 heat wave in Europe was devastating. In France alone, and very dependent on the way you count things, it appears there were about 35,000 excess deaths. That heat wave was a lulu, with European temperatures about three standard deviations above the average, something that has a 1‐​in‐​333 chance of occurring averaged over your state or province. Given that there are a lot of places of similar size on the planet, such an anomaly can usually be found somewhere. In 2003, that somewhere just happened to be at the epicenter of global warming angst.



Then there was the great French heat wave of 2006.



Whoops. Don’t know about that one? Climatically, it was pretty comparable, but far fewer French fried.



A. Fouillet and his team of researchers wrote this up in a 2008 paper in the _International Journal of Epidemiology_. They started off with a simple (i.e. logical and testable) model relating temperature to mortality and found that something in addition to the heat killed a lot of people in 2003. While their model predicted about 17 deaths per 100,000, the observed rate was 21 per 100,000, or about nearly 7,000 bodies.



(There’s plenty of speculation on the cause, with fingers pointed at France’s August recess, when everyone — including health care workers — takes to the beach or the hills and leaves the old folks at the non‐​airconditioned home)



In 2006, their model showed nearly 4,500 _fewer_ deaths than expected.



What the French did was (begrudgingly) emulate urban Americans. They _adapted_. The government bought air conditioning (formerly a crass Yankee invention) for retirement homes. They implemented a National Heat Wave Plan that keeps tabs on the elderly, who were left to swelter in 2003. They set up cooling shelters for those without A/C.



And, of course, adaptation is what’s happening in our cities. Perhaps the most politically incorrect thing an urban administration can do is to be caught flatfooted by the weather. Chicago’s Daley dynasty was (temporarily) swept away by a 1979 snowstorm when it selectively canceled rail service in southside black neighborhoods. And who can forget Washington’s colorful mayor Marion Barry, cavorting at the 1987 Super Bowl during back‐​to‐​back storms. White stuff set him up.



Want proof of our adaptation to heat? Two extremely hot cities, Tampa and Phoenix, have virtually no heat‐​related mortality, despite sporting the oldest populations in our study. In only one city is mortality increasing. That would be young and vibrant Seattle, where summer heat is still very rare.



I am sure many consider it immoral to export heat‐​related mortality to the North, but that won’t last for long. Seattle’s latitude is about 48 degrees north. The vast majority of our hemisphere’s cities are south of there, and by the time you get to 60 degrees, not very far away, you tend to run out of cities. At that point, global warming will have squeezed urban heat‐​related mortality off of the map.

"**Six people have been fined by police in Oban for travelling into the region from a level four area for a house party.**
The fixed penalty notices for breaking Covid-19 restrictions were issued over the weekend.
Officers also handed out four fines to the occupants of a vehicle that came from a level four area.
Oban is in Argyll and Bute which is at level two under the Scottish government's coronavirus restrictions.
Scotland moved to a five-level system of localised restrictions earlier this month, with the aim of suppressing the virus in high-prevalence areas but allowing more freedom in places with fewer cases.
A group of 11 council areas in the west of the central belt are set to remain in level four - the top tier of curbs - until 11 December.
Insp Mark Stephen, from Oban Police, said officers would continue to use enforcement ""as a last resort where there is a clear breach of the legislation"".
He said: ""The chief constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change as a result of travel restrictions now being in law.
""However, officers may in the course of their duties come across people who are travelling from one local authority area to another.
""In areas where travel restrictions apply, officers will continue to use the common sense, discretion and excellent judgement that they have applied since the crisis began."""
"Be under no illusion, the world is losing the fight against climate change. The amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere continues to increase, meaning humanity is forcing the Earth closer to cataclysmic alterations that will reshape the entire biosphere. But the UK could capitalise on the momentum gained through its recent net zero emissions pledge to take the lead and herald a shift towards serious global climate action. How? By copying a strategy followed by – of all people – the George W Bush-era neoconservatives.  Hear me out. Those who disagree with my opening statement will of course point to the Paris Agreement: a global alliance that boasts 185 signatories fighting back against climate change. Yet Paris is a reflection of international law, which means it represents only the lowest common denominator that those negotiating parties could agree. For this reason the agreement is premised on state discretion, taking the form of “nationally determined contributions” where countries decide for themselves how much they will cut their emissions. The agreement does have positive attributes, and there is scope to argue that it is useful. But it is not able to compel states to hit the ambitious targets necessary to stave off the threat of more warming. Climate Tracker illustrates this by finding that five states are “critically insufficient” in their efforts to prevent more than a 1.5°C increase, and a further 19 states are at least “insufficient”.  Countries could instead deal with contentious international threats by stepping away from the usual processes of international law, and introducing frameworks that aim to uncompromisingly challenge the root of the menace. And there is some precedent. One example is the 2003 Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) – a set of principles designed predominantly by the US to curb the international transfer of materials related to nuclear weapons. Crucially the PSI was not negotiated. Instead states were invited to endorse a framework of principles that had already been created. The argument was that a typical treaty would be too slow, too cumbersome, and reflect the usual challenges of international law, ruling out any serious responses.  The PSI was able to attract 11 countries at its inception, and currently 107 countries have endorsed its principles. Its success is measured by the fact it is still in operation today and is considered to have increased cooperation and indeed reduced the transfer of nuclear weapon material. The context was of course 9/11, which drove the US and its allies to pursue aggressive international policy absent any meaningful reflection on what those policies would mean for the multilateral landscape. Among the neocons who partly ran Bush’s foreign policy, the prevailing mood was that extreme times call for extreme measures against a threat they could not easily grasp. Sound familiar?  There is a certain irony in linking the PSI to climate change, as the same Bush administration was actively against a robust climate policy. Yet though it lacks in international diplomacy, the same strategy offers clear practical advantages. The PSI was only possible because the US was determined that the threat of nuclear weapons was so severe that it had to lead on a response. This is precisely the type of leadership that is lacking on climate change. There have been some positives in 2018, and the UK has emerged as a potential climate leader. Following the paralysis of London by activist group Extinction Rebellion, the UK parliament took the unprecedented step of declaring a climate emergency, though what this means precisely remains unclear. Then there was the announcement of legislation to target net zero emissions by 2050 by the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May. So how to capitalise on that momentum, and spread it worldwide? My suggestion is that the UK follow the precedent of the PSI and create a Climate Security Initiative (CSI). A CSI could encompass a set of bold principles to reduce emissions and champion green technology, going well beyond the Paris Agreement and propelling the UK into a leadership position that other like-minded states would be able to support. There already exist a number of states that could form an initial CSI group, all willing to commit to radical steps to fight climate change. Ireland, for instance, has also declared a climate emergency. New Zealand, too, has begun the legislative process to become carbon neutral by 2050, while Finland has targeted 2035.  Of course the proliferation threat does differ from climate change. The latter is intrinsically linked to the global economy and the behaviour of billions of people. Decarbonising humanity will mean radical change on an unprecedented scale, spanning from the state to the individual. Yet we can choose to control this change through net zero aspirations, or we can have it forced on us through a radially altered climate not necessarily conducive to human existence.  The benefit of a CSI approach is that not only can it be designed to meet the threat head on, something the Paris Agreement has failed to do, but also if led by the UK it will help to counteract the narrative that the developed world simply isn’t doing enough to combat its historic role in emissions creation. A CSI offers the UK a way to transfer its recent political declarations into tangible action, without being stifled by international law. If the UK really wants to “lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth” it has to look beyond the Paris Agreement, and beyond its own borders – something a Climate Security Initiative could achieve.

Manuel Ayau, one of the people I most respected and admired, died today. Muso, as his friends called him, was a major figure in the international movement to promote liberty. He was a president of the Mont Pelerin Society and served on the board of directors of Liberty Fund and as a trustee of the Foundation for Economic Education. He will be most remembered, however, as the founder and president emeritus of the influential Francisco Marroquin University in his native Guatemala. He leaves an enormous legacy because he successfully combined clear thinking, entrepreneurship, intellectual curiosity, and a belief in the potential of free individuals to create what has become the center of classical liberal thinking in Latin America.   
  
  
Well before he founded Francisco Marroquin University in 1971, Muso Ayau started a think tank (Centro de Estudios Economicos‐​Sociales) with a small group of Guatemalan friends in 1959. Thus began a lifelong project to discover and disseminate those ideas that best explain and provide solutions to underdevelopment. The process led him to the writings of the great market liberals—some of whom he invited to Guatemala for lectures or established friendships with, such as Ludwig von Mises or Milton Friedman—and culminated in the founding of FMU. Muso was not an academic (he had a degree in engineering), but he understood how the power of ideas can influence society, so he set about the long‐​term task of running an institution that would teach generations of Guatemalans about “the ethical, legal and economic principles of a society of free and responsible persons,” no matter what degree students pursued.   
  
  
In his inaugural address in 1972, Muso stated: 



We firmly believe in the capacity of imperfect human beings to be better able to realize their destiny when free and not when compelled by the collective entity personified by the state.



It took courage to found the University. When it began, the intellectual and political climate was not only hostile to libertarian ideas, it was violently opposed. Guatemala was in the midst of a civil war and neither side—with the military and business establishment on one side and leftist guerrillas on the other—particularly welcomed the message of limited government, free markets, and private property rights. In the early days, Muso gave graduation speeches wearing a bullet proof vest under his toga. In the 1980s, he would sometimes wear disguises when traveling in public and took extra security measures at home.   
  
  
After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Guatemala’s civil war in the 1990s, public opinion was of course much more open to market liberal ideas, but Guatemala’s mercantilist society still ensured that the battle against entrenched interests—business groups, unions, government bureaucracies—remained tough. By then, though, the prestige of Muso Ayau and of the university faculty and its well‐​trained graduates had grown as had the presence of their ideas. Anyone who has visited Guatemala during the past 20 years, as I have, can attest to the fact that market liberal ideas can be found every day in the op‐​ed pages and articles of the country’s leading newspapers and the electronic media as well. In some cases, this has translated into radical policy change—as in the case of Guatemala’s successful telecom reform or its law legalizing competing currencies.   




Muso was proud of the progress classical liberal ideas had made despite the fact that statism still prevails in much of Guatemala. He was at once an optimist with an ambitious vision and a realist with a modest view of himself. He was not surprised that much of the left and right resented his call for an end to all government‐​established privileges. Though Muso could have been fabulously successful going along with the established framework of Guatemalan society, he chose not to. In this, he was a rare Latin American specimen, a champion of truly progressive ideas that peacefully challenged formidable political forces.   
  
  
Yet not everybody cared to understand this. Lawrence Harrison famously and inexplicably described Muso as “an archtypical, far‐​right, Latin oligarch” who is also a libertarian. Harrison’s incoherent description came in the summer of 2001 when it was discovered that the U.S. embassy in Guatemala was secretly distributing a document to other embassies describing Muso and the university as enemies of democracy and progress. The whole sorry episode, described by Mary O’Grady in the _Wall Street Journal,_ hardly shocked Muso and his colleagues, who had long been denouncing Washington’s heavy‐​handedness in Guatemala and the region. (Muso later drew up business cards with his name, followed by “Archtypical far‐​right, Latin libertarian oligarch.” Even in the face of ridicule, Muso kept his famous, good sense of humor.)   
  
  
The ideas that Muso Ayau began promoting in Spanish in Guatemala in the 1950s, soon drew in brilliant thinkers from other parts of Latin America and influenced the classical liberal movement throughout the region. FMU continues to draw the world’s leading thinkers in a range of disciplines including business, philosophy, law, economics, and literature to its state‐​of‐​the art campus and it has served as the model for other such universities in countries as diverse as Chile, Montenegro and Georgia. That so many students and professionals in Mexico, Central and South America and beyond understand and support the free society today is in no small part due to his efforts, whether they know it or not.   
  
  
Muso always admired the Cato Institute and he was delighted, as were we, that Cato and FMU began a yearly, week‐​long seminar for Latin American students in classical liberal thought in Guatemala. I will never forget how, during the first such event in January 2009, Muso took a quick, round‐​trip flight from Houston, where he was receiving treatment for the cancer that he ultimately succumbed to, just to give his scheduled lecture to the students. His enthusiasm, wit and warm personality filled the lecture room.   
  
  
Muso was a living embodiment of the classical liberal spirit. He was also a friend. He will be missed, but his spirit will continue to infuse the work of Francisco Marroquin University and many, many advocates of liberty around the world who knew him or were somehow influenced by him.

If sanctimony and hypocrisy were renewable energy sources, the Pacific Islands Forum could fuel the globe for the foreseeable future. Rarely has such a tiny pond crammed with such oversized bottom-feeders belched out more insincerity and fraudulent greed.



Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack’s remark that Fiji will continue to survive on Australian foreign aid and fruit-picking jobs might have been injudicious, but it’s not like he was completely wrong. Australians’ cultural proclivity for blunt talk may often veer into insensitivity, and Frank Bainimarama’s chagrin at McCormack’s sledge is certainly understandable. At the same time, though, it might be pertinent to consider that while Beijing’s smooth-talking might pander to Pacific nations’ chipped shoulders, China will still have its pound of flesh in the end.



Then there’s this piece of breathtaking hypocrisy from Kiribati.



Australia should be sanctioned or suspended from the Pacific Islands Forum over the Morrison government’s pro-coal stance, Kiribati’s former president, Anote Tong, says.



Fine – and we’ll take our foreign aid with us. **Which will blow a 40% hole in Kiribati’s entire gdp.** But the duplicity doesn’t end there:



The Sydney Morning Herald reported Mr Tong saying if a country causes harm to others, such as by fuelling climate change, “there should be sanctions”.



  
Does that include countries whose tourist trade – fuelled by jet-fuel-guzzling international flights – contributes megatonnes of CO2 to climate change every year? Kiribati might need a gentle reminder that it recently signed a deal for four shiny, new jet airliners for its national carrier. 



Meanwhile, the PIF’s rota of the gullible and greedy are lapping up the snake-oil from Beijing.



Beijing has condemned Australia and accused it of acting like a condescending master towards Pacific countries, insulting climate-vulnerable nations and “spreading the China threat fallacy”.



China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Pacific island leaders did not share Australia’s fear of Chinese influence in the region.



Meanwhile, there’s a little place called Hong Kong. Ask **them** how they feel about coming under Beijing’s thumb.



This is an old, old ploy from the Chinese communists. During the Cold War, Beijing pandered to preening third-world popinjays by parroting their anti-colonialist rhetoric (even as Beijing was invading Tibet and Vietnam, and trying to monster Taiwan into submission). Now, awash with cash following Deng’s economic reforms, the communists are buying friends and hangers-on like a drunken tourist in Patpong.



Speaking in Beijing, Geng said […] China had been providing assistance to island countries “with no political strings attached” and without insults.



  
And that’s just how mendicant despots across the developing world like it. Western nations, like Australia and the U.S., actually expect **reform** for their money. Beijing just doles out the cash.



But if the PIFs think there’ll be no strings attached as Beijing turns the Pacific into a Chinese lake, they’re bigger buffoons than they look in those silly shirts.

 **Burn, Hollywood, Burn**  
A regular review by John Black



Over 1 million people sign up to ‘storm’ Area 51, the U.S military base thought by tin-foil hatters to contain extra-terrestrial beings. Vaccination rates fall across the western world after anti-vaxxers cause ‘vaccination hesitancy’ among parents. Twisted white guys obsessed by ‘the Great Replacement theory’ gun down innocent women and children in Christchurch and the US.



In the age of the internet, conspiracy theories all too easily migrate from fabulists’ fever dream to real-world consequence. 



In 1976 a man named Bill Kaysing self-published a pamphlet entitled ‘We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle’. Since then the idea that mankind’s greatest technological achievement is a big fat lie has become crank gospel. Kept on a low simmer by cheap TV documentaries and badly printed books you find in the same shops that sell crystals and ceramic bongs, the idea has roared into life with the oxygen of the Internet. According to a recent poll conducted in the US, 18% of millennials believe it was all a hoax. 



The absurdity of these claims should be obvious even without any consideration of the scientific evidence. A recent Oxford University paper found that 411,000 people would have had to have been ‘in on’ the conspiracy without there being one whistleblower. And all this orchestrated by the Nixon administration, an administration which couldn’t manage to cover up a simple burglary properly?



Yeah, right.



So what’s the antidote for this idiocy?



Films like ‘Apollo 11’.



A brilliant new documentary on the moon mission, it blends original colour footage (50% of it never seen before) with radio exchanges between Houston and the astronauts to create an immediacy that belies its fifty-year vintage. Using only Walter Cronkite’s contemporaneous narration the film opens close to launch time with shots of excited spectators camping out for the big event. The genius of the film is in creating tension when we all know the ending (SPOILERS: They land on the moon. Yes, you vaping, weirdly-bearded millennial, THEY LANDED ON THE BLOODY MOON). Director/editor Todd Douglas Miller achieves this by on-screen countdowns for each stage of the mission and split-screen sequences showing the NASA Control Centre and the spacecraft simultaneously. He is aided by a pulse-pounding electrophonic score by Matt Morton, which matches perfectly the relentless drive for technological achievement played out on the screen.



Middle-aged men in short-sleeved shirts staring into computer monitors has never been so gripping. 



While there is plenty of technical talk, info-graphics and shots of the balletic manoeuvrings of the spacecraft there are also reminders that this was a human endeavour. Buzz Aldrin referring to moon craters as ‘big mothers’ and his deadpan assurance to an over-anxious Houston controller, ‘If I stop breathing, I’ll be sure to let you know.’ Neil Armstrong’s awe at the ‘stark beauty’ of the moon’s surface. The constant monitoring of the astronaut’s heart rates which vary according to how crucial the stage of the mission is (Aldrin’s seems to be the coolest customer with the lowest heart rate, ironic given the way he loses it on this idiot – but who can blame him).



The emotion that lasts after viewing is one of awe. Awe at the bravery of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins and the ingenuity of the NASA folk behind them. Awe at the majesty of human scientific achievement. At a time when human technology is being blamed for one of the most hyped up evils of the age – climate change – this should be a valuable corrective. I recommend it for all those who like myself exalt in scientific achievement and are curious as to how exactly the moon mission succeeded. But I also recommend it for those millennial moon hoaxers. Die-hards won’t be convinced (‘It’s all CGI NASA propaganda!’ I hear them cry) but those wavering might well end up as I did, silently saluting the men responsible for our first baby steps to the stars.

A stint as an Indiana budget official gave me a firsthand view of how policymakers use taxpayer money to serve their political self‐​interests.



So when an Indianapolis news channel discovered that the state’s economic development agency was taking undeserved credit for job creation, I was probably the least surprised person in the state.



If there is one issue that resonates with voters today, it is jobs. As government at all levels grows in size and scope, voters become conditioned to look to policymakers as the source of economic development.





If there is one issue that resonates with voters today, it is jobs.



And because simply cutting taxes means less money for politicians to spend on vote‐​buying programs, targeted subsidies to businesses have become popular. They buy favorable press at a cheaper price.



Indiana is no exception. The Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC) uses subsidies in an attempt to lure businesses and jobs to the state, or to keep them here. The IEDC might not admit it, but most businesses already know where they plan to locate before they contact the agency. Businesses consider a myriad of factors including demographics, transportation logistics and workforce capabilities when choosing where to set up shop. Although the tax and regulatory climate is an important consideration, IEDC handouts are just that — handouts.



Because a governor will get credit for creating jobs, businesses know they can extract taxpayer money from the state for these subsidies. After a company reaches an agreement with the IEDC, the administration issues a news release. For the high‐​profile deals, it arranges a choreographed ribbon‐​cutting ceremony at the company’s facilities. The company helps fulfill its end of the bargain by telling the media that the administration’s support sealed the deal.



Witnessing this charade from inside the administration of Gov. Mitch Daniels led me to coin the phrase “press‐​release economics.”



Not everyone in the administration, however, bought into the IEDC scheme. My former agency, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was tasked with monitoring the performance of state agencies, including the IEDC. And as we knew to be the case with many of the state programs, the IEDC’s claims were known to be inflated. It is implausible that the rest of the administration, including the IEDC itself, didn’t know about the fuzzy math.



The administration’s political chicanery, however, has now come back to bite it. A recent WTHR Eyewitness News investigation into IEDC shined a light on the job‐​creation claims. When reporters tried to visit some of the companies celebrated in IEDC news releases, they found empty fields, vacant lots and deserted factories. According to the investigation, “as many as 40 percent of statewide jobs listed as so‐​called economic successes have not happened — and most of them never will.”



The governor told reporters that the IEDC’s numbers were audited. Independently? That would be news to me. When I was a deputy director at OMB, the governor’s chief advisers ignored internal suggestions that the state pursue the creation of an independent auditing agency along the lines of the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The position of the IEDC director is that no taxpayer money is being lost because his agency audits the companies to make sure they fulfill the terms of their agreement with the state. The director, however, has so far refused to release any details to the public that would support this contention.



In summary, Indiana doesn’t need a politicized economic‐​development bureaucracy to create a welcoming environment for businesses. One alternative would be to eliminate the state’s corporate income tax, which has a relatively high 8.5 percent rate. The revenue loss could be offset at least in part by shuttering the IEDC and eliminating targeted tax breaks.



The governor, of course, might have to forgo some news releases. The long‐​term benefits to the state, though, should be worth the political sacrifice.

"**A ""restrictive"" regime imposed at a prison due to coronavirus has resulted in a rise in violence and mental health issues, inspectors have said.**
HM Inspectorate of Prisons said strict rules at HMP Lindholme, near Doncaster, meant prisoners spending long hours in their cells ""without reprieve"".
An inspection in October found the restrictions were not proportionate when compared to other prisons.
Progress to relax the regime had also been too slow, inspectors concluded.
Charlie Taylor, HM chief inspector of prisons, said the regime introduced in March was in line with guidelines designed to protect staff and inmates from Covid-19.
However, Mr Taylor said most of the 900 inmates were allowed out of their cells for less than an hour a day and it was not uncommon for them to spend 28 hours in their cells at weekends.
""There was mounting frustration among prisoners who reported the excessive time spent locked up was having a negative impact on their well-being, including weight gain, difficulty in sleeping and a deterioration in their mental health,"" he said.
Plans by the governor to ease restrictions had stalled as negotiations with the local staff association had failed to come to an agreement, Mr Taylor said.
""While we were aware of the need to ease restrictions in a safe and measured way, progress had been far too slow,"" he added.
""The failure to improve the regime during the summer meant prisoners were now subject to a second-wave tightening of restrictions without having had much reprieve.""
Mr Taylor did praise the prison's education team, noting that more prisoners were engaging with education than before the pandemic and he said there had been improvements in prison safety since it was inspected in 2017.

The natural CO2 flux to and from oceans and land plants amounts to approximately 210 gigatons of carbon annually. (Note that this is carbon. Multiply the numbers by 3.7 for the total weight of CO2 including the two oxygen atoms.) Man currently causes about 9 gigatons of carbon to be injected into the atmosphere, about 4% of the natural annual flux. There are estimates that about half of man’s emissions are taken up by nature, or 2%. Why only half?

Figure 1 from NOAA and the IPCC, 2001 numbers, here.
The chart above updated to current numbers, implies that 3 gigatons of man’s emissions are absorbed by the oceans and 1.5 gigatons by the rest of the biosphere. If the vegetation on land absorbs 120 gigatons and if rising CO2 improves biosphere production, why isn’t all the excess CO2 also absorbed? It is because the biosphere is being destroyed faster than it can adapt to rising CO2.
About 60 years ago, I read somewhere, probably National Geographic, that the Amazon rain forests were the “lungs of the earth”, the place where CO2 was recycled back to oxygen. This phrase is still widely used, just Google “lungs of the earth” with the quotes and examine the result. One article in particular drew my attention. A quote:

…as recently as 19th century, tropical rain forests in their own right covered around 20% of all the dry land area of the Earth, but this figure was only 7% by the end of the 20th century.”

The world-wide increase in CO2 is not due to fossil fuel burning, it is due to the destruction of the worlds lungs. Clearing tropical forests for Biofuels production is contributing to that destruction.
Tropical rainforest destruction world-wide runs between 0.5% and 1% by area annually. The world’s lungs are suffering from TB, timber burning. For a horrifying world view of this problem go here, and view the video. Here is a MODIS satellite image of Myanmar on just one day. The red areas are fire.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading IPCC critic and co-author of CO2 skeptic book The Neglected Sun Professor Fritz Vahrenholt was interviewed yesterday on MDR German radio.
We have to at least give credit to MDR for even inviting a real skeptic – indeed a rare event in German public media.
The MDR moderator begins by claiming that the new IPCC report warns of galloping climate change and accelerating sea level rise. Christiana Figueres says that it’s a wake up call for the world.
What follows is an excerpt of the interview.
Moderator: Is it a wake-up call for you?
FV: I see big progress in the new climate report towards more realism and more openness. First of all the IPCC recognizes that the Medieval Warm Period was just as warm as it is today. That had always been disputed. That means that without CO2 we had situations in the past, in history, that were similarly warm. There has to be a reason for that. There are natural factors for warming, which the IPCC had always played down. Secondly, the IPCC for the first time has taken into account that it hasn’t gotten warmer in 15 years. It recognizes that, and acknowledges that the climate models are not correct. That is a very important success by the critics…
Moderator: Huh.
FV: …and it is far more important that the science here stood its ground when the German government, the employees of [Environment Minister] Herr Altmaier tried in Stockholm to have the 15-years of no warming deleted from the report because they feared the people would see that it hasn’t gotten warm in the last 15 years, and so then you can’t…
Moderator: Huh.

FV: …push through such a massive energy transformation. I think it’s wonderful that the scientists resisted that.
Moderator: I have the impression that we’re discussing different papers here. Just let me summarize what I just told you: Climate change is progressing more rapidly and with more strength than expected, and, you can read it in the report, man bears the main responsibility for the warming through GHG emissions. What you’re saying sounds completely different.
FV: Well you see, when you really look into the report, you’ll find that it states that man is responsible for more than 50%.
Moderator: I agree.
FV: But I’m saying that it’s going to be maximum 50%. But the real question is: what’s behind the other 50%? The other 50% is nature itself. It’s the sun. It’s the large-scale ocean currents. We have to admit that there has not been any warming in 15 years. There’s no explanation for this. The IPCC can’t explain it. I can explain it. Many critics can explain it: it’s because on one hand the sun has weakened since 2000; because the major ocean cycles have tipped to their cold phases. We are going to experience it. In The next 10-15 years we are going to see a further modest cooling; we aren’t going to see any warming and…
Moderator: Huh.
FV: …here at least the IPCC has signaled that it at least sees this. But it cannot interpret this. On the outside it is saying everything is going to get worse.
The moderator then asks Vahrenholt if we no longer need to care CO2 emissions at all. Vahrenholt replies that of course that we should, but that it isn’t necessary to rush madly into it and economically shoot ourselves in the foot. Nature gives us the time to work on a sensible CO2 policy. “Every additional year of no warming shows that the models are wrong. The models that cannot reproduce the last 15 years of no warming, how are they supposed to correctly give us the temperature for the next 100 years?”

Markets will be hanging on every word in Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s speech Friday morning in Jackson Hole, Wyo. That is because the minutes from the July 31‐​Aug. 1 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released on Aug. 22, were widely interpreted as signaling some kind of further easing of monetary policy.



The minutes stated in part that “many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery.” And yet, one day after the minutes were released, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said they were “a bit stale.” This turned market sentiment around, sending equity prices down.



So will he send a signal favorable to “additional monetary accommodation”? Or will he endorse Mr. Bullard’s comments?



Looking ahead to its next meeting on Sept. 12 and 13, the FOMC could decide to initiate a new round of “quantitative easing” through purchases of Treasury bonds, mortgage‐​backed securities or other unconventional asset classes, which has been its strategy since the fall of 2008. It might also choose to extend beyond the end of 2014 the period in which it anticipates holding the federal‐​funds rate near zero. These aren’t mutually exclusive possibilities.



But whatever path Mr. Bernanke points the FOMC toward, further “monetary accommodation” of the type being discussed will be futile at best or counterproductive at worst.





Bond purchases won’t change any fundamental determinant of economic activity.



Consider the kind of policies implemented by the Fed since the crisis began. One variety consisted of credit allocation, whether by direct lending to targeted financial institutions or even nonfinancial firms such as auto makers. Fed purchases of mortgage‐​backed securities direct credit to favored firms and sectors rather than to the businesses that could make most productive use of it.



Subsidizing housing finance is especially problematic, as homebuilding clearly overexpanded in the early 2000s and needed to contract. If public policy subsidized a good into excess supply, further subsidies aren’t the cure. The Fed has merely delayed adjustment in the housing and financial sectors by continuing to direct credit to them.



The Fed has also engaged in temporary infusions of money into the economy via two previous rounds of quantitative easing, QE1 and QE2. It did so after driving short‐​term interest rates to near zero, which limited the effectiveness of traditional purchases of short‐​term government debt.



Quantitative easing is the Fed’s version of “stimulus,” the complement to fiscal stimulus. The trouble with all forms of temporary spending is that they have no permanent effects. They delay needed adjustments in the economy.



Today’s state and local governments are a case in point. Municipal and state spending was propped up by federal transfers of many billions of dollars in the president’s 2009 stimulus package. But as this federal money has dried up, public payrolls are declining, ironically enough for this administration, close to the presidential election. President Obama received bad advice when he was told that government spending would prime the pump of the economy. Instead it had the effect of temporarily transferring resources from the productive private sector to a bloated public sector.



The Fed’s version of temporary stimulus will likely involve purchasing government bonds. If past is prologue, this will act as a sugar rush to financial markets. There will be equity and bond‐​market rallies. _Wall Street_ will rejoice, but none of this will translate into “substantial and sustainable” economic growth, the FOMC’s stated goal.



Bond purchases won’t change any fundamental determinant of economic activity. And in the current economic climate, a crucial issue is that investors don’t know what the tax code will be next year. Investments are made in anticipation of after‐​tax profits. If the tax rate is unknown, investment returns are unknown. That is a great deterrent to capital formation and job growth.



This is no secret: The FOMC minutes from its July 31‐​Aug. 1 meeting refer to fiscal and regulatory uncertainties as a reason for the Fed to take action. The minutes reported that some participants thought a new bond‐​buying program “might boost business and consumer confidence.” It hasn’t done so in this recession. No amount of quantitative easing at this point will stir what John Maynard Keynes called the “animal spirits”—“a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction”—needed for growth.



What would stir the spirits of investors and employers would be some policy certainty, reining‐​in of out‐​of‐​control government spending, stopping ill‐​advised regulations, and clearing the air of antibusiness rhetoric. No repeat of a one‐​off round of bond buying by the Fed substitutes for the fundamental and permanent changes needed.

On the battle between Arrhenius and Ångström.
Story submitted by John Kehr, The Inconvenient Skeptic
Any serious discussion about the Theory of Global Warming will eventually include the absorption band argument that started more than 100 years ago between Arrhenius and Ångström.  One of the arguments presented by Ångström was that the main CO2 absorption band is between 14-16 micron and that band is also absorbed by water vapor (which is correct).  The counter to this by Arrhenius was that it didn’t matter in the upper atmosphere where there was no water vapor.  Of course none of this matters because radiative heat transfer is only 20% of the energy transferred to the atmosphere, but that is generally ignored by both sides of the argument.
At the time there was no way to measure the temperature in the upper atmosphere so there was no way to determine what was going on there, but of course now there are many ways to measure the temperature there.  When I started looking at the annual temperature behavior of the stratosphere and the top of the troposphere I found something very interesting that is as usual, bad for the warmists.
Here is the average daily temperature of the troposphere (at ~4.2 km) and the stratosphere (41 km).


What makes this so interesting is that they are completely out of phase with each other.

The tropospheric temperature is matched to the natural global temperature cycle.  This is highly dependent on the geography of the Earth’s surface.  The stratospheric temperature is not in phase at all with the surface temperature.  It is however in phase with the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.  The distance the Earth is from the Sun determines how much energy the Earth gets from the Sun.  Here is the stratospheric temperature and the solar constant over the course of the year.

While I would not say that the upper atmospheric temperature is completely independent, it is mostly independent of the of the lower atmosphere.  The cooling in the stratosphere each spring is exactly what would be expected based on the changing solar constant.  The warming that takes place in July is likely caused by the peak atmospheric temperatures in the NH that take place during the summer months.  That warming stops in October, but by that point the increasing solar iconstant warms the stratosphere.
What determines the stratospheric temperature is absolutely critical to understanding why it has been cooling over the past 60 years (which is about how long it’s temperature has been measured).  If the stratosphere’s temperature is primarily dictated by the incoming solar energy then the argument made by Arrhenius is meaningless.  That is because the increase in CO2 would never have an impact on the temperature there, simply because so little of the energy needed to warm the stratosphere comes from the Earth’s surface.
Based on the scientific data, the stratosphere is mostly influenced by the solar constant (basically the distance from the Sun for this discussion).  There appears to be some influence from the lower atmosphere, but it is clearly marginal.  This is not really a surprise since the energy transfer mechanisms are very limited above 12km.  The low atmospheric density results in low vertical mixing rates which only leaves radiative transfer which is a poor method for heat transfer when low absolute temperatures are involved.
When the temperature of the stratosphere and the troposphere are compared for the period from 2003-2011 it is also interesting to note that the peak stratospheric temperature was lowest of the whole period in early 2009.  This also matches the period of minimal solar activity over the entire period of time.  All of these pieces together clearly demonstrate the importance of the solar constant on the stratospheric temperature.  This also means that any impact by atmospheric CO2 levels on the stratospheric temperatures is very limited.

By Dr. Sebastain Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited with permission by P. Gosselin)
The Antarctic ice shelf is made up of huge ice sheets that float on the ocean and are firmly connected to the mainland ice cap. There are two main ice shelves: the Ronne-Filchner and Ross (Figure 1). There are also a number of other smaller shelves.

Figure 1: Shelf ice in the Antarctic . Image courtesy Scambos et al. 2007; provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
The ice shelves act as a block that holds back and brakes the mainland ice sheets. Just how well is this safety block functioning today? Do we have to worry that the Antarctic ice sheet will soon slide into the ocean and cause a sea level surge?
Such a horror scenario was spread to the public by climate scientist Anders Levermann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) four years ago. In a blog article at the PIK-friendly Klimalounge-Blog, Rahmstorf’s institute fellow colleague suggested dramatic consequences for the Antarctic shelf ice should a fundamental shift in global energy supply not rapidly take place. Levermann is also very closely associated with the IPCC and is a lead author of the current climate assessment report. In a recent article titled: “Untenable ice shelf – Updated“ he upped the stakes and added:
Simulations of the Antarctic here are briefly introduced. These show that the loss of the Ross Ice shelf 3 million years ago led to the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet and a seven-meter rise in sea level. […] to make statements with certainty on whether the retreat of the ice shelf is accelerating, the current data sets are not sufficient.”
According to theoretical simulations, the shelf ice is expected to disappear. Levermann does admit, however, that these models cannot be compared to hard measured data. Within the scope of the PIK ice shelf catastrophe publicity campaigns, a PIK Phd candidate was sent in to do an interview with the evangelical online magazine Chrismon, in which she made some surprising statements:
Climate change: The ice is sliding into the sea. In ten years… the Earth will be much warmer than today, climate scientist Maria Martin claims. She can prove this with the help of computer models.
CHRISMON: Has it gotten warmer in Antarctica?
MARTIN: We can assume this, also when the directly measured data in Antarctica do not go back very far. In 2002 a large ice shelf collapsed, it simply fell apart. We suspect this because melt water had formed there.”
Computer models as proof? That’s an adventurous claim. Even the IPCC reminds us that computer models only depict scenarios and can never be used as proof. Not a good start.
Then comes her next gaffe: Has it gotten warmer in Antarctica? Martin answers yes to this, but with a reference to supposedly limited measured temperature data, leaving a back door open. Let’s take a look at this supposedly “limited measured data” (Figure 2). According to RSS satellite data, it has gotten a bit colder, and not warmer, in Antarctica since measurements began in 1979. Obviously the PIK scientist is quite wrong with her suspicions. Her concluding reference to a past ice-shelf break is not exactly enlightening. Such calving is part of the transport conveyor that carries snow that was converted to ice in the interior of the seventh continent and on over to the coast. The ice shelf collapse she mentions has about as much informational value as a spilled sack of rice in China.

The final statement of the Potsdam ice shelf catastrophe campaign was made on 11 May 2013 at the online Neuen Potsdamer Nachrichten (PNN) [New Potsdam News]. Read it for yourself:
Chain reaction in Antarctica is feared Already in this century a gigantic ice slide threatens to occur in the Antarctic region, which up to now has played hardly a role in climate change. This is the conclusion that German scientists have reached with two simultaneous computer simulations. Unlike what was assumed, climate change also impacts the Weddell Sea, the largest shelf sea of the Southern Ocean on the Antarctic continent, scientists report in the journal ‘Nature‘. The warm water masses are having a massive impact on the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf. […] The giant ice sheet will soon begin to rapidly melt and disappear by the end of the century, the two scientists write with respect to their calculation. As a consequence, great amounts of mainland ice could slip into the ocean because shelf ice acting as a barrier would be lacking. This in turn would lead to a rise in sea level. ‘ Shelf ice is to mainland ice what a cork is to a bottle,’ explains AWI oceanographer and lead author of the study, Hartmut Hellmer. ‘They brake the flow of ice because they get snarled up everywhere in the bays and, for example, they get lodged on islands.
Also a second study published in ‘Nature Geoscience’ points to such a development. Scientists led by Martin Siegert of the British University of Edinburgh analyzed the thickness of two ice flows that feed into the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf using Georadar (Radio Echo Sounding, RES) – and the ground properties underneath. According to the analysis, there is a large steeply inclined basin with a smooth base that would hardly be able to counter a slip-away. The melt rate will increase from 5 meters per year today to up to 50 meters per year by the end of the century, so estimates AWI oceanographer Jürgen Determann. How the mainland ice would react to the mega-melting ice shelf is still open. However the scientists assume that it moves and that it will slide increasingly faster. Should the melting ice be completely offset by the subsequently flowing mainland ice, this would lead to an additional sea level rise of 4.4 millimeters per year.”
Other media outlets gratefully jumped on the story, such as the Augsburger Allgemeine and Spiegel. Yet, in the meantime, things have quieted down with regards to the Antarctic ice shelf catastrophe. For some reason the PIK and its associated institutes have lost their desire for the subject. What happened?
Hardly a month had passed since the Potsdam campaign ended before the first scientists appeared in public with very inconvenient words. A team of scientists led by Tore Hattermann of the Norwegian Polar Institute published a study showing gross errors made in the theoretical ice shelf models used. Hattermann and his colleagues set up a 12-tonne drilling rig on the surface of the Antarctic Fimbul ice shelf and bored through the more than 200 meter thick ice sheet at three locations. Underneath the ice they measured the temperature and produced a data set that was unique in its kind. Here they found surprising results: The ice shelf models had assumed a much too high temperature underneath the ice. In reality the water beneath the shelf ice was considerably colder. The mass loss postulated by the models could no longer be supported in the face of the new hard temperature calibration data. Moreover, the ice mass of the ice sheet currently appears to be hardly changing, as the team led by Hattermann was able to show in a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Then just a few weeks later, things got a lot worse for the Potsdam scientists: In September 2012 a study in the journal The Cryosphere was published by a team of researchers of the University of California Irvine led by Bernd Scheuchl. Here the scientists compared radar measurements of the Antarctic Ross and Ronne ice shelves from 1997 and from 2009. Here the scientists determined the changes in ice shelf’s ice flow speed over the 12-year period. Both the large Mercer and Whillans ice flows of the Ross ice shelf had slowed by 50 m/year and 100 m/year respectively. Also most ice flows that feed into the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf show a moderate slowdown.
The results simply are not cooperating at all with the postulated Potsdam Antarctic shelf ice catastrophe.
Now just out is yet another paper that has been in print since the end of June 2013: Earth and Planetary Science Letters. An international team led by Christina Hulbe of the University of Otago in New Zealand extended the study even further back into the past. Using surface speed measurements from the 1970s and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) from the 2000s, Christina Hulbe and colleagues were able to show that the biggest portion of the Ross ice shelf had slowed down in its movement during the last 30 years.
In Potsdam they reacted by switching the focus over to Indian monsoons. This will get them the media’s attention for a couple of months – at least until serious scientists take a closer, more serious look at the basis of their newest alarm story.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt are the authors of the new book: The Neglected Sun.

"Britain’s warm, wet winter brought floods and misery to many living across southern England, with large parts of Somerset lying underwater for months. When in January rainfall was double the expected average over wide areas, many people made cautious links between such extreme weather and global climate change. There were nay-sayers at the time but it now seems that there is evidence for those links. Speaking at the European Geosciences Union annual meeting here in Vienna, Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, presented his take on the issue. At the gathering of more than 12,000 geoscientists, Allen reported an ambitious computer experiment that his team has undertaken over the last two months to test whether the winter floods could be attributed to climate change. And it seems that they can be linked. The floods of January 2014 certainly were extreme. According to Oxford’s records of daily rainfall, they were unprecedented in 250 years. The records at the UK Met Office from the 20th century also show that this winter was, historically, uniquely bad. The IPCC report does suggest that extreme weather events should be expected as the world warms but the prediction is couched in cautious terms and the risk is assessed as “medium” confidence.  At the Environmental Change Institute in Oxford, researchers Nathalie Schaller and Friederike Otto analysed results from almost 40,000 climate model calculations to test the impact of climate change on Britain’s winter rains. Their calculations modelled the weather across the country on a 50km grid. They compared the results of 12,842 simulations based on the current global sea surface temperatures, with 25,893 results computed on the assumption that global warming had never occurred – that fossil fuel burning had not raised CO2 to today’s levels and ocean surfaces were cooler. Such a huge number of calculations was needed to tease out the statistical differences between the two scenarios. It was only possible through the participation of thousands of members of the public in the work’s biggest ever climate modelling exercise: they offered up spare processing capacity on their home computers to run the calculations via the Climate Prediction citizen science climate modelling programme. The results showed a subtle bias towards more extreme weather in today’s warming world. Events that would have been expected once in 100 years before global warming can now be anticipated to occur once in 80 years. In essence, the probability of extreme winter floods appears to have increased by 25% on pre-industrial levels. Allen pointed out that this is the first quantitative evaluation of the influence of global warming on Britain’s 2014 floods. Thomas Stocker, a professor of climate and environmental physics at the University of Bern and chairman of the IPCC working group charged with assessing the physical origins of climate change, said that the Oxford group’s results had “shown movement in one direction only – toward greater risk”. Although the results from the models cannot yet give definite measures of the probability of a flood, they do provide an insight into how those risks have changed and continue to change – information that is of great interest to insurance underwriters, among others. Otto said: “Past greenhouse gas emission and other forms of pollution have loaded the weather dice”, adding that she and others were still working on investigating the implications of the results, for river flows, flooding and ultimately the threat to property and lives. Some will, no doubt, question the result on the basis that it is “simply” a statistical test. The results from the two modelling scenarios are, at first sight, very similar. But the fact remains that they are distinct, showing that rising global ocean surface temperatures directly influence UK winter rainfall.  The results affirm the strong and growing scientific consensus developing from the understanding of the physical origins and consequences of climate change, as outlined in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Working Group 1 report last September. Those that choose to ignore them, or contradict them, will (I predict) still be directly affected by them. And we will be hit where it hurts most – in our wallets. How likely is it that the insurance industry will ignore such results?"
"In the industrial era, economic growth has become equated with human progress, with a fundamental assumption that material growth and consumption inevitably leads to improvements in our well-being. Over the past 45 years, the world’s population has doubled to seven billion people, and the world’s economy has grown almost four-fold, from US$11.2 trillion to US$42.5 trillion. Thus, GDP per capita has almost doubled; so we should be twice better off, in terms of health, wealth and happiness, than in the 1960s. Certainly we are by some measures healthier: mean life expectancy has risen from 56 to 70 years, driven by a two-thirds drop in child mortality, from 153 to 51 per 1,000 live births. But these advances have come at a cost, borne by the natural world whose resources and vitality have been depleted. And they have been spread unevenly – despite producing a third more food than in 1961, some one billion people remain poor and hungry. Four-fold economic growth has still left more than two billion people living on less than US$2 a day.  So there are many in the world who need to consume considerably more, simply in order to meet their basic needs. But taken as a whole, the average global citizen consumes too much. If those without are to reach decent levels of sustenance, housing and health, then those currently enjoying the fat must consume less. But this is not widely accepted. Analyses conducted across 189 countries confirm that at very low per-capita GDP, life satisfaction increases sharply with any rise in income. This incline is steep, but above a surprisingly low threshold of approximately US$10,000, affluence brings diminishing returns for life satisfaction. So well-being, understood as satisfaction or happiness, is not connected intrinsically to wealth and consumption, and the relentless pursuit of GDP growth does not lead to consistent gains in well-being in affluent countries, those that have passed the threshold of easy life improvement. But again, this is neither widely accepted nor understood. Consumption of any kind is usually viewed as an unchallenged good. This decoupling of affluence and happiness has been demonstrated in longitudinal measures of life satisfaction since the mid-20th century. It can be seen by comparing relative changes in GDP in since the 1940s against changes in life satisfaction: it is the same in UK, the US, and Japan. More things do not seem to make people more happy. Professor Tim Jackson has concluded that we have been “betrayed by affluence”, and Professor Partha Dasgupta has observed “the rogue word in GDP is ‘gross’”. A priority must now be to create opportunities for alternative, divergent ways of living, as the current material culture has failed, and continues to fail, both the rich and the poor. The target is economic growth that is more green growth, defined by the UNEP as “resulting in human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities”. Deep political commitment to this is rare, despite the evidence that acting early to counter the effects of climate change, resource depletion and ecological destruction would be cheaper than bearing the costs later. A UNEP report concluded that investing just 2% of world GDP into the green economy would be sufficient to reduce energy-related CO2 emissions sufficiently to stay within the maximum level deemed safe of 450 parts per million. Some countries, including China, Denmark, Ethiopia, South Africa and South Korea, are promoting a green agenda which could lead to a new industrial revolution. China has invested US$100 billion since 2000 in eco-compensation schemes, mostly forestry and water management. Subsidies (feed-in-tariffs) introduced in 65 countries to encourage renewable energy has led to renewables now meeting 17% of world energy consumption.  Many poor countries’ revenue is absorbed by the cost of importing fossil fuels – Kenya, Senegal and India spend 45-50% of their earnings from exports on importing energy, for example. By investing in renewable energy – Kenya has introduced feed-in-tariffs for renewables, India is pressing ahead with huge solar energy parks – these nations save money, become more self-reliant, and improve the quality of the environment at home. Yet these kinds of green economies that seek to change aspirations and consumption patterns by increasing consumption of the currently poor and reducing that of the affluent, increases well-being and protects natural capital are not likely to look much like the current economy. Large changes are now needed.  The futuristic Korean science and technology vision envisages an advanced economy driven by clean energy, low carbon use and green growth. Priority technologies include polymer electrolyte fuel cells, space solar power, integrated water and sewage management, bio-oil replacements, zero-emissions housing, seawater desalinisation, wearable robotics, vertical farms, self-diagnosing materials, automated driving systems, floating cities, smart dust technology and rotating buildings for sharing sunlight and views. Without moving economies and consumers towards an attitude of “enough, not more”, material consumption and the damage it brings the planet will continue to grow. But this requires knowing “how much is enough”, and teaching us all to recognise when we have it, and to look to other forms of non-material consumption; story-telling, creating, or engaging with nature. Cooperation will speed and improve community bonds and social capital, which reduces inequality.  At the heart of a green economy will be four tenets: resist consumerism by opting out, such as through downshifting or voluntary simplicity, retain possessions for longer before replacement, make different choices (ethical or green consumerism), and substitute material consumption with non-material alternatives. Conventional economic growth based on rising consumption is not tenable, and a shift to a green economy is inevitable; it is a question of whether it occurs before or after the planet becomes locked on a path toward severe climate change and other eventualities that will cause potentially irreparable harm to the planet. It may all turn on affection for places and possessions, observed E M Forster. Even the greatest civilisations have their day and decline, and beliefs or ways of doing held as fundamental are dropped and others taken up. “Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go on strong forever,” said Margaret in Howard’s End, “it may be followed by a civilisation [that] will rest upon the earth.”"

For the seventh time now, I am spending a week in July at a Chinese university with several other Americans to speak about economics to Chinese students. And every visit, I learn more about the growing communist giant across the Pacific.



However, these experiences have gotten more difficult as Washington and Beijing clash over issues large and small. More important, though, has been the internal crackdown in the People’s Republic of China. My first trip to the PRC was in 1992: it was a vastly different country, one finally exiting the Maoist era’s intermittent lunacy. In the succeeding years, there was increasing liberalization — most obviously in economic policy, but also in terms of personal autonomy.



The Tiananmen Square massacre likely closed off any prospect of serious regime reform, but political controls remained loose at the edges. Academic exchanges flourished, freedom‐​minded NGOs operated, and the Great Firewall was penetrated. Independent‐​minded Chinese journalists, though unable to challenge the Communist Party’s monopoly of power, had space to expose government misdeeds. These all fueled hopes that economic reform and market transformation would encourage a freer Chinese society.



Alas, President Xi Jinping seems to have killed that possibility, at least for the present.



Academic exchanges have become more difficult; NGOs have been shut down, churches destroyed. Human rights lawyers have been arrested, internet controls tightened, and a totalitarian “social credit” system developed. Foreign policy, too, has become more aggressive: pressure on both Taiwan and Hong Kong has increased, and, perhaps most notably, Uighurs have been incarcerated _en masse_.



These and other related changes have significantly accelerated a decline in Sino‐​American governmental relations.



This increasingly restrictive political climate has also created greater uncertainty in nonpolitical relationships. A couple months ago, I arrived in China for a conference scheduled for the next day only to be told that I (and other foreign invitees) could not participate. The local party had decreed that they required Beijing’s approval if we were to attend. I had spoken at the same event two years before and wouldn’t have said anything particularly controversial. But no matter: this was an old requirement, I was told, which until recently hadn’t been enforced.



Americans involved in politically sensitive research — regarding Tibet or Xinjiang, for instance — have long risked being denied entry into the PRC. But recently the U.S. and China have engaged in a new variant of “visa wars,” with Washington the aggressor, revoking permission for Chinese university professors and others to visit America. Beijing has retaliated against those with connections to the Trump administration.



Even more informal personal contact is subject to greater scrutiny. Though I had done so in the past, a company that prepares Chinese students for overseas study was hesitant to have me speak (about education, not politics) at their events this year. University students admitted that they believed some subjects, such as Donald Trump, to be too sensitive to ask about. This in contrast to a few years ago, when I was questioned about Tiananmen Square and internet censorship in Chinese economics classes (which I tried to answer with appropriate political sensitivity).



Washington is uncertain as to how it should respond to the increasing challenges posed by Beijing. China is not an enemy and should not be treated as such, but the Trump administration’s trade war and other economic restrictions continue to weaken what was traditionally the foundation for our bilateral relationship: economic partnership. With the usual corporate defenders of bilateral ties essentially silent, the China-U.S. relationship has become much more uncertain.



Moreover, the U.S. still fails to distinguish between vital and peripheral interests. When Washington officials talk national security, they’re really interested in influence. Underlying American policy is a determination to remain dominant in the region, which China views as its geopolitical sphere. U.S. interests there are real, too, but comparatively modest, while those of the PRC are fundamental, even existential. Washington’s current aggressive policy, if unchanged, may well make conflict inevitable.



Both governments should do much better at facilitating contact between private citizens. It’s especially important when inter‐​government relations are tense and unproductive.



Despite the sometimes disconcerting stares that still greet Westerners, most Chinese are friendly. Many have relatives in the U.S. and have traveled to America — or hope to do so. A taxi driver struck up a conversation with one of our number who knew Chinese. The cabbie had two children in Georgia. After discovering that one my colleagues was from the same state, he didn’t want to charge us for the ride.





Although the dealings between the American and Chinese governments sometimes leave me pessimistic, the attitudes of younger Chinese give me a glimmer of hope.



Chinese academics and officials with whom I speak readily separate the actions of Americans’ government and Americans themselves. Students exhibit an even greater fascination with the U.S. They like its culture and sports. They favor English‐​language T‐​shirts. They don’t like government restrictions on their personal autonomy. But they tend to be strong patriots and nationalists. Most important, they are Chinese, not American wannabes, no matter how much they like U.S. values and practices.



Yet both governments have been interfering with private contacts. For instance, the U.S. is concerned that Chinese scholars are working with their government’s intelligence services. Such suspicion seems inevitable for anyone who calls the mainland home, family members being vulnerable to government retaliation. Not many are willing to tell a dictatorship no. While thoughtful controls over foreigners’ access to security‐​related information is necessary, American policymakers should not isolate the U.S. from those who know and like this country. Rather, Washington should to use them in its own “intelligence work,” learning as much from them as possible.



Indeed, private trips can act as informal, quasi‐​track II events. That is, governments can effectively exchange policy and political ideas through private actors. The lack of official accountability allows for greater creativity and experimentation. Ideas can be mooted and discussed without being officially offered. Given the growing bitterness of the public debate in both nations, keeping private diplomatic channels open supplements American foreign policy. The result, hopefully, will be to maximize the number of considered ideas while prodding governments to think more creatively.



Returning again and again to the same university to teach economics seminars has created enduring friendships. Obviously, these relationships are unlikely to transform political ties between the two capitals. But nevertheless, on both sides, at least a few more can count as friends those from other nations. The more this phenomenon spreads, the more difficult it becomes for governments to demonize others to justify hostility, conflict, and war.



Such contacts, multiplied nationwide, can also help create an easier familiarity with the other side. That can mean understanding better how the other parties think and behave, a greater willingness to talk with foreign counterparts, and increased trust in the intentions and proposals advanced. Obviously, my spending a week annually with one university has little chance of transforming the bilateral relationship, but the aggregate impact of a multitude of individual relationships could make a real impact.



Reaching students may be even more important in the long‐​term. As collegians enter the workforce, they will begin to change their nation. It would be best if they appreciated the values of liberty and understand how designing policies that protect them can be practical solutions. Indeed, most already object to internet censorship and other restrictions, though few can be expected to challenge their government. The best outcome in the PRC is likely the gradual transformation of the regime through an internal process led by just such young people. Reinforcing their natural inclinations would be a positive investment for the future, even if the impact would be uncertain and indirect.



But the contacts do not go only one way. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that foreign students now attend this and other Chinese universities. The enrollment of the school that hosted the economics seminar is not huge, and there are no Americans, at least none who attended the classes. However, a number of countries are represented: Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Poland, Belarus, and the Czech Republic. These students will affect their domestic counterparts, who will be China’s leaders in the future.



Although the dealings between the American and Chinese governments sometimes leave me pessimistic, the attitudes of younger Chinese give me a glimmer of hope. The students are interested and want to learn. They value freedom in their own lives. They are fascinated by the outside world. They desire to make their nation a better place. And they are willing, even eager, to engage Americans.



China will be one of America’s biggest foreign policy challenges for years to come. But Washington can do much by encouraging private, personal contacts. The U.S. will need every advantage that it can get to deal with the PRC in coming years.

"The blackcurrant harvest on my allotment is highly dependent on the weather. In 2018 the UK had a hot, dry summer and the currants were sweet and plentiful. So far 2019 has been cold and wet, and the currants are few and tart. Just like my blackcurrants, the animals and plants of the world respond to their environment – and especially the changing climate. However, what scientists have not really understood to this point is whether the responses that species are showing will help them to survive in a changing world. In a new study, published in Nature Communications, the ecologist Viktoriia Radchuk brought together a large team of collaborators (myself included) to pool what we know about two key areas of biology.  First, we were interested in how animals are responding to climate change, with a focus on changes in shape and size (“morphology”) and changes in the timing of life events (when birds lay their eggs, when dragonflies emerge from ponds and so on – known as “phenology”).  Second, we were interested in how those changes affect their success (or evolutionary “fitness”): does earlier egg laying lead to greater survival of chicks, for example. By linking the two datasets, we could infer whether the responses of species to climate change would help them to keep ahead of the change. While many different groups of animals and plants have been studied in this way, birds are one of the few groups that have been followed in the same locations over multiple years. For example, the University of Oxford has run the Wytham Woods Tit Project since 1947, studying changes in the population of great tits and blue tits using 1,000 nest boxes and a complex array of microchipped birds and feeding stations. That study has been able to track the timing of reproduction, the number of eggs laid, and the weight and size and the birds during the period of recent climate change – all vital to the aims of our project. Radchuk compiled a vast dataset covering 4,835 studies on 1,413 species, of which 71 contained all the information needed: a change in climate, a change in either the size/shape of the animal or the timing of a biological event, and a clear link between the size/shape or timing and the “fitness” of the animal (usually how many offspring they produced). Those 71 studies were almost entirely on birds, and so that became the focus of the work. The data showed that higher temperatures were shifting everything earlier in the year – birds were arriving earlier at breeding sites, beginning to breed earlier, and the young were developing earlier. Importantly, these earlier events tended to help the birds to breed more successfully. However, in a clever piece of mathematical modelling, we also show that the pace at which birds are tracking climate change is not fast enough to keep them safe in the long term. The results suggest that at least some species of bird may be able to adapt to changing climates without having to move for the time being – an important finding given that even if we set aside climate change, humans are already destroying or fragmenting many bird habitats. We also show that there is no increase in the degree of adaptation to changing climates during the studies, so the responses of birds (while helping for now) are limited in what they can achieve.  The key novelty in this work lies in bringing together a vast quantity of data that has been recorded for a large number of species sometimes over several decades. This treasure trove of data reveals just how remarkable the natural world is to be able to track a changing environment. At the same time, the fact that even that amazing flexibility is not sufficient to keep pace with ongoing climate change is yet another important piece of the argument for tackling the human contribution to climate change.

It had to happen. She may have a nice smile and seem like a decent enough person, but Jacinda is simply not prime minister material, and it is finally beginning to show. Her inability to answer questions because she simply does not know the answers is becoming legendary. Her absences from the house have seen her labelled as the _#partimepm_. Her tendency to dash off overseas at every opportunity and leaving the mess behind her, is an obvious ploy. Dare I say, her other trick, of wheeling out the baby every time she is in trouble, is becoming extremely obvious too. 



Her popularity would have waned sooner, had it not been for the Christchurch massacre. Whilst no one would have wanted it to happen, the mosque shootings were a godsend for Jacinda. The whole world praised her for her empathy and compassion. She handled the situation well but her knee jerk reaction to ban semi-automatic weapons has shown her up for the amateur she really is. In a supposed attempt to make everyone feel safer, she has given us all reason to feel much less safe than we did before, as law-abiding citizens give up their guns; but the gangs, of course, do not. 



Matthew Hooton believes her popularity has fallen by 16 points, to 35%. Sure, it is still a long way ahead of Simon Bridges’, but it is a very big drop in popularity in a very short time. It seems that people are finally starting to see through her. 



Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says losing some of her popularity is the result of taking on serious challenges in Government. 



“When it comes to the personal ratings what I equally accept is that when you are in Government and taking on big challenges and difficult conversations and hard debates there are going to be people who disagree with you,” Ardern said.  
“We are not going to make progress on some of these big difficult issues unless we are willing to confront hard conversations.  
“If you simply govern just to maintain popularity it probably means you are not taking some of those big issues on.” 



But she is not taking on any of the big issues. Kiwibuild is a big failure. Mental health has a lot of money allocated to it, but with little or no progress so far. Child poverty and homelessness get worse and worse and, this week, we found out that suicide rates are the highest ever. Ever.



Did she mean that telling Fletchers to stop working at Ihumateo, putting a commercial agreement and property rights at risk and then boarding a plane to go to the islands and leaving everyone else to sort out the mess is her idea of dealing with the ‘big issues’?



Ardern’s government has moved on the controversial issues like abortion and climate change and has ploughed money into mental health, which she describes as one of the long-term challenges facing New Zealand. 



Wasting billions of dollars on “climate change” when we contribute less than 1% of global emissions is madness; and most people know it. Many people, while agreeing that abortion should be removed from the Crimes Act, do not want to see late-term abortions, and they are horrified at the prospect. As for the money being ‘ploughed’ into mental health, the latest suicide statistics would suggest that this is just another case of allocating money but having no idea how to spend it – which is something that this government is famous for.



So Jacinda is dreaming if she thinks her popularity is in freefall because she is tackling the ‘hard issues’, because she isn’t tackling any of the hard issues at all. She wouldn’t know where to start. It is much more likely that people are seeing her for what she really is – a decent enough person, but someone who is way out of her depth, who does not understand some of the basic concepts of government, and should never have been put where she is in the first place. 



That is the truth about our prime minister. We all know it, and she probably does too.

"**Debenhams is set to close all of its 124 stores after last-ditch efforts to rescue the department store chain failed.**
It looks like it is finally the end for the 242-year-old business.
It reached its position as a lynchpin of the UK retail landscape by 1950, when Debenhams became the largest department store group in the UK, with 110 stores.
And in 2006 it joined the stock market - for the third time - with a worth of Â£1.7bn - a price tag it has never topped since.
Over the last decade, it started its descent, as its profits fell and debts became unmanageable.
The chain has been placed in administration twice over the last two years, with the pandemic proving to be the final straw.
So how did things go so wrong for Debenhams?
Experts say Debenhams has fallen behind with fashion trends over the last decade, a problem familiar to other mid-market High Street retailers such as M&S.
Maureen Hinton of retail consultancy GlobalData says it lacked products that differentiated it, which left it exposed when dynamic new brands, many of them operating purely online, started breaking through.
""Back in the 1990s they had Designers at Debenhams, where designers like Ted Baker or Jasper Conran would do in-house ranges for them. That was a good differentiator but they never moved on,"" she says.
""They also filled their stores with concessions that weren't anything you couldn't buy anywhere else on the High Street.""
It made it very hard to compete against newer fashion retailers such as Primark, Boohoo and Asos, which also branched into other areas that Debenhams did well, such as beauty.
Debenhams also failed to adapt quickly enough as more and more shopping moved online, says veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman.
But he caveats: ""It is no good having a good website if the product isn't right. The bigger problem was the brand became irrelevant.""
Over the years, Debenhams expanded at a rapid rate. In 2006 it announced plans to double its number of stores to 240 and was opening new shops as recently as 2017.
At the same time, shopping habits shifted and consumer spending was squeezed - firstly because of Brexit uncertainty, and then by the pandemic.
Debenhams was left with many underperforming shops which came with high costs, including rising rents, business rates, wages and maintenance.
Those liabilities got harder to cover, as revenue began to fall and the retailer booked a record Â£491.5m loss in 2018.
Sir Ian Cheshire, Debenhams' former chairman, told the BBC that its shops became a ""straitjacket"" and the retailer would have been better off with just 70.
Ms Hinton says this made turning the business around almost impossible when coronavirus hit.
And Mr Hyman says a lack of strong leadership in previous years added to the problem. ""In order to arrest the decline there was an even greater need for top talent. But those people tended to avoid Debenhams.""
As a by-product of its expansion, Debenhams also ended up shouldering unsustainable debts - something some experts blame on poor financial decisions.
Back in 2005, the retailer sold 23 shop freeholds to property investment company British Land for Â£495m and then leased them back.
This locked the chain into costly leases of up to 35 years, with average annual rent rises guaranteed at 2.5%.
The short-term cash benefit was soon outweighed by the costs, says Ms Hinton, and by March this year the business was shouldering Â£720m of debt.
In a desperate bid to restructure its finances, Debenhams was put into administration in 2019, wiping out its shareholders. It then secured a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its landlords, enabling it to cut its rent bill and embark on plans to close 50 of its 166 stores.
But the damage was already done and it was placed back in administration in April 2020.
Mr Hyman says: ""Its fate was sealed by the private equity-style of swapping assets for large amounts of debt, which might just about work in a growing economy and a growing retail market.
""Instead it left Debenhams fighting with one arm behind its back."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn general, the media in Germany overwhelmingly welcome Obama’s plan to tackle CO2 emissions. But for many, Obama’s plan does not go far enough, or is just a front for something more sinister, like fracking. Others are skeptical whether action will actually follow his lofty rhetoric.
What follows are some German media reactions.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung even ridiculed the decreed, intrusive measures planned by Obama:
The National Security Agency has also been instructed to place a trojan in every computer. Monitors, TV screens, microwave ovens, and fridge displays are to function with the following screen-saver after being switched on every morning: ‘World Leader against Climate Change’. New car registrations are to be possible only when the color-poster of the ‘Action Plan’ are factory-installed in the interior of the windshield so that they are easily visible.”
Die Welt: Connie Hedegaard says that USA must now bow to international law.
EU climate commissar Connie Hedegaard emphasized that action has to follow the good intentions. The USA must obligate itself to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions over the long-term within the scope of a binding world climate agreement.”
Spiegel: “bruising and potentially costly political battle”
President Obama laid out an ambitious campaign to address climate change Tuesday, mapping a course that would bypass Congress to cut emissions from hundreds of coal-fired electric power plants and setting the stage for a possible rejection of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline. The effort could shape Obama’s presidential legacy and fulfill a key promise of his 2008 campaign. It also could plunge him into a bruising and potentially costly political battle.”

Die Zeit: “hollow words…long list of bureaucratic decisions ”
US President Obama announced a new initiative for climate change. But hollow words are what’s left. Environmentalists say they are disappointed. […] Apart from his arousing rhetoric, his speech, interrupted by polite applause, was a long list of bureaucratic decisions and descriptions of measures. De facto what the plan is.
However, Obama’s latest environmental initiative is probably about political damage control. One of the most delicate issues during his presidency is the decision on the Keystone Pipeline.”
Süddeutsche Zeitung: “way too little, much too late”
Obama’s Minimal Solution to Healing the Planet […] From an international perspective, it is way too little, and much too late. If the US President wanted to set example to the world, then he would have to much more unrelentingly limit America’s notorious wasting of resources.”
Die Tageszeitung (TAZ) of Berlin: “bypassing Congress”
This time President Obama wants to assert a new climate policy by bypassing Congress. […] For ‘clean’ energy, in addition to wind and solar, he is banking on nuclear energy and – foremost – production of gas. Also with fracking.”

Riffing on the name of a popular science website, it has been remarked that “Everyone f-ing loves science – until it contradicts their personal bullshit”. Never a truer word could be said about, not just activists, but so-called ‘science journalists’ who don’t seem to grasp even the fundamentals of science. Instead, these legacy media hacks simply regurgitate whichever press releases suit their ‘narrative’.



Such ignorant fraudulence was in abundant supply at last week’s Pacific Islands Forum and its attendant media coverage.



The ABC’s reporting of the ­Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Tuvalu from August 13 to 16 was a spectacular case in point. In a bid to wedge Scott Morrison on the public broadcaster’s favourite subject, climate, Pacific leaders received a free kick. But here’s the thing: most of the islands are not sinking. That is what the peer-reviewed science shows.



In a famous paper from the University of Auckland released last year and based on sophisticated physical models, scientists showed many of the atolls on Tuvalu, Kiribati and Tokelau are actually rising. The finding confirms observations from satellite photos showing the islands are increasing in area, Tuvalu by 73ha between 1971 and 2014.



It gets worse. The ABC’s own fact check unit confirmed this in a ruling last year […][so] where was Paul Barry’s _Media Watch_ , normally the ABC’s ­climate science policeman?



You’ll sooner meet a genuine “climate refugee”, though, than drag an acknowledgement, let alone a correction, out of our taxpayer-funded broadcaster.



But even the ABC’s prostitution and distortion of actual science pales into that of grasping Pacific leaders who’ve spotted the perfect leverage for another generation of handouts.



Patricia Karvelas did not ­appear to know the science when she interviewed Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga on RN Breakfast on August 14.



“What impact is the changing climate having on your country right now?” Karvelas asked.



Sopoaga replied: “People are about to be […] swallowed into the sea because of erosion …”



Sapoaga was allowed to peddle not just this nonsense without challenge, but the utterly fraudulent claims of “climate refugees”.



Remember all the scare stories in the 1990s and early noughties quoting the UN predicting “50 million climate refugees by 2010”?



But if journalists are ignorant about actual climate science, as opposed to scary press releases from e-NGOs, their knowledge of the geopolitics of the Pacific is even worse.



Journalists covering the Pacific should know much more about the history of Australia’s ­relations with its island neighbours. Since the forum was launched by New Zealand in 1971 this has largely been the work of Coalition governments as Labor after the Keating era looked increasingly to Indonesia and China for its foreign policy impetus. The Morrison pivot to the Pacific is back to the future.



This is something Peters understood even if his Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, and many journalists, did not…



  
Some Pacific leaders might be well advised to ask the leaders of states to the north, across the South China Sea, whether they think China is the kindly benefactor some at the PIF seem to think it is.



Pacific mendicants seem to be running the razor’s edge of playing the big geopolitical powers – China, the US, and middle-power Australia, which is a pivotal power in Pacific terms – against each other, and scrabbling for the pennies as they fall out. The legacy media are too ignorantly eager to join in and seize the opportunity to damage a newly-elected conservative prime minister, with no thought for the long-term cost.



Pacific Islands will almost certainly feel the very real consequences of toadying to an aggressively expansionist China long before any dodgy climate alarmism projections come true.

EPA regional administrator Al Armendariz tours the Mobile Classroom (Photo credit: americaspower)

Junkscience.com reports that:
EPA official Al Armendariz who rocketed to infamy last week because of 2010 comments about “crucifying” industry, has resigned from the agency.
Click for his resignation letter. (PDF)
Here’s the source of the uproar, this video:


Inhofe wasted no time going after this public servant turned crucifier.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, announces that he has launched an investigation into the Obama-EPA’s apparent “crucify them” strategy targeted at American energy producers. This investigation will look into EPA’s actions towards domestic energy production specifically in light of the agency’s recent efforts relating to hydraulic fracturing.
Inhofe’s announcement today follows several questionable statements from top EPA officials, including comments released in a little-watched video from 2010, which reveals EPA Region VI Administrator Al Armendariz admitting that EPA’s “general philosophy” is to “crucify” and “make examples” of oil and gas companies.

Unfortunately, there are dozens, perhaps hundreds more just like him at the EPA, an organization that seems to be at war with the industry of the United States of America, and the people too. See:
The EPA and undisclosed human experimentation

Fakegate Apologism — It’s How They Roll 
Guest post by Chris Horner 
This morning I read a terrific recounting of the “the fact that a whole section of the scientific establishment is defending Gleick on the grounds that it’s OK to lie to promote their cause…from the intellectual heights of the establishment and specifically from those who have proclaimed themselves to be experts on scientific ethics.” (“‘Fake But Accurate’ Science”, TIA Daily, subscription required). Following on my post Fakegate: It’s what they do, and Anthony’s continuing elaboration of the “noble cause corruption”, this recalled for me a recent experience that had nagged at the back of my mind, bothersome for what it indicates. And it all fits together. 
Last week I gave a talk at Yale Law School on the role of environmental regulation, sponsored by the Federalist Society and Young America’s Foundation. I made my way to the greatest economic boom-time opportunity we’ve ever faced — we’re told — which happens to be (surprise!) a massive regulatory boom. But before being sold — in adaptation to the downturn — as an economic boom it was sold — during flush times — as necessitating economic slowdown. Got it.

Rationales I cited and supported with sources included: make the uneconomic “profitable” (Pres. Obama, Ken Lay), redistribute the world’s wealth (UN guy), restructure the global economy, “level the playing field” (unions, greens, EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom), “slow down our economy” (Bill Clinton, Alan Greenspan), create a boom economy (Pres. Obama, Al Gore, Carol Browner, some congressmen), transform our economy (Tom Friedman), “raise billions of dollars”/finance social agenda (Pres. Obama, lawmakers), avoid having “too much energy”, too little drudgery (John Holdren and his ilk). 
President Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union speech that, even if you doubt the scientific argument, it’s “the right thing to do”, echoing movement-godfather Sen. Tim Wirth who said the very same thing in 1988. Now, with more “human redemption”! (guess who). 
Thomas Friedman, responding to such doubts, told Meet the Press that, “everything we would do to get ready for climate change, to build this new green industry, would make us more respected, more entrepreneurial, more competitive, more healthy as a country.” 
To which Jonah Goldberg responded, “Thus Plato’s Noble Lie is resuscitated in a pas de deux of flimflammery. The diagnosis might be fake, but the cure will still fix your lumbago, whiten your teeth, and give your horse a shiny coat.” 
And I walked through the raging hypocrisy and outright fabrications embodied in the sales pitch for an agenda that was rebranded as pollsters dictated. When John Kerry cancelled the scheduled (by pure coincidence) Earth Day introduction of his cap-and-trade bill, he told the press it was because “this is not an environment bill.” Amending the Clean Air Act. Granting authority to the…EPA. Riddled with hundreds of references to “environment”, “greenhouse” and “pollution”.  
Not an environment bill. And, true enough, no one says it would detectably impact the climate. It was repackaged and introduced as the Kerry-Lieberman American Power Act.  It was now a jobs bill. His pollster told him so. 
And it would bring a jobs boom the likes of which we had never seen, though it had killed jobs everywhere; it would lower the price and increase the reliability and security of our energy supply, though the opposite had been proved true; and it would lower emissions as study after study indicates the opposite results, from the inefficiencies. 
Hey, man, back off. There’s a “cause” to push here, after all. By whatever means necessary. 
During the discussion that followed one attendee, a student at the nation’s most prestigious law school clearly unnerved by my challenging the climate agenda, if not by the brazen employment of untruths to justify employing the state’s police power, complained that I was merely making fun of flaws in their communication effort. In focusing on such details I wrongly ignored the larger problem that we must act. 
So, a movement being exposed as risibly dishonest in saying whatever might wash in order to get their way, a way which as I noted is leading to terrible human consequences in the European theater of operations where they are several years ahead of us, merely harps on a communications problem? 
No. This is a movement — someone once called it a “cause” — clearly not about what it says it’s about. After all, no one or no computer model on which they premise their cause claims that anything they’ve ever proposed, all of which is typically sold as salvation, would actually do anything about that in which name it is demanded. 
These are Alinskyites, schooled that the issue isn’t the issue. When I pointed that out at a Heartland event, a leftist journalist in the audience dedicated many words of outrage in response. Outrage grounded in (faux) morality. Outrage not that I would say that — she also went on to say that of course the issue isn’t the issue. But that I would say that. 
She had heard me recount the serial admissions of this by her ideological allies, but left that part out of her otherwise deathless essay which found room for anything and everything else. Not relevant. 
As always with this crowd, it’s one’s cause, or motivations, that determine the rightness of their words or deeds. Greenpeace said the same thing about how our replicating their FOIA request to the University of Virginia was, well, different than their identical effort. Sorry, their multiple efforts. Our “objective” was different, you see. A hypocrisy shared by the Washington Post and the academic and scientific establishments. 
This movement is quite plainly one infested with unethical actors. Climategates 1 and 2 exposed this. Fakegate affirmed it. The apologies for Fakegate cast it in stone. The political and policy dogmatists only adorn the stone with flowers. R.I.P. 2012. 
This is not a communications problem any more than what we have seen from Fakegate’s fallout represents science.

Foolish politicians driven by extreme green ideology are wasting Australia’s resources.



Australia’s nuclear resources are largely wasted. We have abundant geological potential for uranium and other nuclear fuels. We know how to explore and extract them, but with bans and restrictions that change every election and approval processes that take either some years or forever, only three mines are currently operating. Also, Australia is the only G20 country to ban clean, silent, low-emission nuclear power.



Australia’s waste and sterilisation of coal and oil shale resources is also an international disgrace. Solid hydrocarbon resources are very concentrated stores of value, but cannot be used without temporarily disturbing other resources such as soils, vegetation and stored water.



Freehold land rights throughout the British Commonwealth once included mineral rights and there was no conflict between landowners and miners. But avaricious governments stole those rights and the royalties that once went to freeholders now go to governments. This separation of surface rights from underground rights is the source of continual conflict. Greens then harnessed landowner resentment into anti-mining crusades.



Expanding national parks and heritage areas has been a powerful green tool to prevent exploration and sterilise coal and oil shale resources. As have the destructive laws that give priority to coal seam gas, water or arable land resources. Farms can be generously compensated to relocate, forests can be replanted, topsoils can be set aside or re-created and water and gas can be extracted prior to mining. But solid mineral and energy resources can only be mined or sterilised. All past civilisations have recognised this resource imperative.



Australia’s oil and gas resources are largely untested. There was great excitement and headline news in the past when oil/gas was discovered in places like Moonie, Barrow Island, Bass Strait and the Timor Sea. Alas, those exciting days are gone and **oil exploration is being slowly killed by green bans** , enquiries and the application of death-by-delay to every stage of the process.



Fracking has opened up huge shale-oil and gas resources in the USA. We can be sure that China, Russia, India and Brazil will soon follow. But of course, it is banned in Australia.



The EU drives the war on hydro-carbon energy. But France, with its nuclear power, can afford to despise carbon energy. As can Scandinavia and many other countries with hydropower, and Iceland with geothermal power. Germany is a green energy poster child – but it is German coal, French nuclear, Scandinavian hydro and Russian gas that keep the lights and heaters burning in Germany. Even the green-EU gets over 70% of its electricity from nuclear and hydrocarbons and about 17% from hydro. No country on Earth can rely entirely on wind and solar power but silly resource-rich Australia is going to try – all in a futile attempt to control global temperature.



Scattered tribes of aborigines once occupied Australia without using the coal, oil, gas or uranium beneath their feet. They mined stone tools and ochres and burned a lot of hydrocarbon fuel (biomass) to clear undergrowth, promote grass, fight enemies, trap and roast wildlife and warm their gunyahs. Australia’s Mega Fauna became extinct on their watch, probably unable to cope with aboriginal spears, fires and dingos plus stressful climate changes. Aboriginal fires produced heaps of CO2 and aerial pollution but they created vast grasslands supporting kangaroos, emus, bustards, parrots and finches.



History shows that a much smaller population could indeed survive in Australia without using mineral hydrocarbons, but life with zero man-made emissions would be grim.



And as our aborigines discovered, if we do not use Australia’s resources, someone else will.

Outside the media and political circles that follow her every move, few probably noticed or cared when Alexandra Ocasio‐​Cortez pronounced capitalism “irredeemable.” But what are we to make of the refusal of former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper — supposedly the moderate in the Democratic field — to admit that he was a capitalist? Speaking on MSNBC’s _Morning Joe_ last week, Hickenlooper turned aside several direct questions about whether he was a capitalist before allowing that “some aspects” of capitalism, like small business, “probably work.” And what about the fact that 77‐​year‐​old avowed socialist Bernie Sanders is in a statistical tie for the Democratic nomination?



Perhaps that’s because Democratic primary voters have a surprisingly favorable view of socialism. According to the latest Harvard CAPS/​Harris Poll, Democrats prefer capitalism to socialism by the slimmest 51–49 percent margin. That’s a long way from President Obama, who just four years ago pointed out that “the free market is the greatest generator of wealth in history — it has lifted millions out of poverty.”



Of course there is ample reason to be suspicious of the combination of cronyism and government intervention that has replaced free‐​market capitalism in recent years. But this new affection for socialism represents a profound misreading of economics, history, and the human condition.





As long as the party keeps lurching left, Trump’s reelection prospects will improve.



For most of recorded history, humankind was horribly, desperately poor. Then, about 300 years ago, human wealth suddenly began to increase exponentially. The reason for this sudden and wonderful change was the advent of modern free‐​market capitalism. And while those at the top of the income ladder undoubtedly saw major gains, those who benefited the most from this increase in wealth were those at the bottom.



In her groundbreaking book _Bourgeois Equality_ , Deirdre McCloskey points out that in the era before modern free‐​market capitalism, great civilizations, such as Periclean Greece or Song Dynasty China, sometimes saw a temporary doubling of national income per capita. Such gains were considered extraordinary. But compare that to the fact that since 1800, developed countries like Sweden or Japan have seen a 3,200 percent growth in per capita income. And with that growth came all sorts of associated benefits, including longer life expectancies, a better‐​educated citizenry, expanded civil and political rights, and reduced poverty. Studies measuring inequality over time against indexes of economic freedom (adjusted to exclude exogenous factors such as educational levels, climate, agricultural share of employment, and so forth) show a small but statistically significant _reduction_ in inequality in countries with high economic‐​freedom scores.



What has been true worldwide has been true for the United States as well. Consider that by most measures nearly all Americans were poor at the start of the last century. Indeed, if we use a definition corresponding to today’s poverty measures, 60 to 80 percent of the U.S. population was poor at the start of the 20th century. Today, while some people undoubtedly continue to struggle, deep material poverty has been nearly eradicated.



It is free‐​market capitalism that is at the heart of this prosperity.



Nor is the debate about capitalism vs. socialism merely a question of economics. Strip away all the bells and whistles and there are only two ways to organize society: markets or command and control. Markets are fundamentally about choice and voluntary exchange. Command and control is about, well, _command_ and _control_ &Mdash; that is, force. Advocates of socialism presume that this power will be exercised by wise philosopher‐​economist‐​kings who can magically determine precisely what wages should be, how much a product should sell for, and what consumers want (or should want). History shows that, instead, those powers are exercised by fallible human beings who not only get economic decisions wrong but cannot resist spreading their new power into non‐​economic areas of our lives.



Donald Trump, with his continuing calls for government intervention in the economy, is hardly the best person to make the case against Democrats and socialism. He is, in fact, emblematic of the cronyism that has come to taint capitalism in the minds of many. But his message may still find a receptive audience.



The same Harvard/​Harris poll cited above showed voters overall preferring capitalism by a 65–35 percent margin. Voters outside the Democratic‐​primary base are far less enamored of socialism. Even many of those choosing socialism probably don’t really mean it, seeing “socialism” as simply shorthand for a more generous welfare state.



In particular, an anti‐​capitalist, pro‐​socialist message will be a very hard sell in the crucial suburbs that have begun swinging Democratic in the last few elections. Voters in those areas are repelled by Trump’s rhetoric and Republican social conservatism but remain capitalists.



There’s no doubt that Trump remains vulnerable, but so long as Democrats continue their lurch to the left, his reelection prospects will look up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday the German and international media, politicians and activists are all in a celebratory mood – the climate catastrophe is back after all. It’s real and approaching faster than ever. The UN just certified it! Climate activists are in a state of euphoria again – they’re out dancing in the streets – there hasn’t been such a feeling since 2007. It’s climate Oktoberfest for the alarmists.

It’s been six long years of relentless torment inflicted by Neanderthal skeptics. Worse, the public was even starting to become hopeful about the future once again, and were becoming less afraid of climate. For the climate catastrophe everything had been looking so bleak as the pesky real observations glaringly contradicted the modeled catastrophes 15 years long.
But happy days are back again – the catastrophe is coming, the UN reassures the world. The 15 years of model failure are not significant after all. In fact the UN now says the models are better than ever and the climate scientists are now 95% confident the climate catastrophe is coming and that our living standards are responsible for it. Never before have scientists been more confident.
Even more encouraging: sea levels will rise faster than expected. Rest assured, the climate catastrophe is coming and things are more urgent than ever. Don’t let any skeptic tell you otherwise, as they only want to spread some damn optimism about the future.
Today alarmists in Germany (and globally) are more giddy than we’ve seen in a very long time. Many alarmists will be going to bed tonight feeling more content than ever, believing they’ll be waking up to a tomorrow of imminent catastrophe.
Here are some quotes from the German news:
“It’s here: the new IPCC report is here! … Congratulations to all colleagues who participated. … Many developments are assessed as being more urgent than in the IPCC AR4 of 2007,” so cheers Stefan Rahmstorf at Scilogs.
“Climate change is real, and its happening at an alarming rate,” proclaim NGO organizations like WWF, Greenpeace, Oxfam, Friends of the Earth, Actionaid and Christian Aid with uncontrollable glee.

“We have indeed even less time than we thought,” gloats a giddy Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research.
“The climate deniers still owe us a convincing answer: if 95% certainty is not enough reason to act, what is it then?” demands Connie Hedeguaard at Twitter.
“Except for the temperature, everything else has accelerated,” beams Stephan Singer of the WWF.
“A very clear signal to the world,” admonishes Mojib Latif of the Geomar Helmholtz Center.
“There’s no problem with the science, rather there’s a problem with taking action,” lectures the kooky side of Spiegel Online.
“As the IPCC and its new report state, sea level could rise much faster by the end of the century than previously believed,” reassures online FOCUS.
Let the alarmists have their day. In the end we all know it isn’t going to last long at all. You can dig up a corpse, clean it up, dress it, and parade it through town claiming it’s alive. But in reality it’s a lifeless, rotting and ghoulish cadaver, and it’s not ever going to be coming back to life.
AR5 is the IPCC’s Order of AGW Exhumation. The alarmists are now parading the corpse, pretending it’s alive and in ruddy health.
But AGW science is dead, and has been so 15 years. It’s not taking a nap, it’s not passed out, it’s not even breathing. It’s long deceased. The UN IPCC and climate activists refuse to come to terms with that.

"**A Â£20 a week uplift to universal credit has helped keep 700,000 people out of poverty during the pandemic and should remain in place beyond March, says a right-leaning think tank.**
Nearly 700,000 more people have fallen into poverty but there would be twice this number without the extra Â£20, says the Legatum Institute.
People who have lost jobs and have high housing costs are worst hit, it adds.
The government confirmed the uplift will be secure until March.
Universal credit claimants were given a Â£20-a-week boost in response to the coronavirus pandemic in April, but this is due to end by next April.
Campaigners have raised concerns that the chancellor did not commit to extend the extra payment in last week's spending review.
Legatum's warning is the latest to the government on the need for continued support for families and individuals caught up in the economic fallout from the pandemic.
For single mum Simone, the outlook is ""terrifying"".
She gave up her job as a sales supervisor in a clothes shop at the end of last year, hoping for a better-paid role in customer relations.
But since the lockdown began in March, finding a job has proved impossible.
""I'm very worried because there's a lot of uncertainty, especially on benefits... some days are really, really difficult,"" she says.
""Food has been difficult. Occasionally it has picked up a little bit. I have been able to do a little bit more of a weekly shop, but it is difficult making sure the money lasts for the whole month... and there are no luxuries.""
The idea of being unable to buy clothes and other essentials for her seven-year-old daughter is a major point of stress.
The pair live with Simone's mum but, as a care worker, she herself is on a low income, so they are still stretched financially - and then there's the issue of space, with three people in a two-bedroom flat.
""You're basically living on top of each other. We manage. We're grateful to have a roof over our heads but it is difficult... especially during lockdown when you're cramped indoors.""
Legatum says before the pandemic about 14.4 million people were estimated to be in poverty in the UK, according to a measure that looks at both income and unavoidable living costs, such as housing.
But its analysis suggests that during the pandemic another 690,000 were left struggling to pay bills and put food on the table.
It says younger and older workers with high housing costs have been hardest hit, as well as people with disabilities.
However, Legatum calculates that another 700,000 people have been kept out of poverty by the extra Â£20 a week, and fears many would be unable to cope if it was stopped.
""Our analysis shows that, at a time of crisis, government action can protect many of those who are vulnerable to poverty,"" said Legatum chief executive Baroness Philippa Stroud.
She told the BBC she wants to see the uplift continue beyond March because ""it takes a while to get yourself up and out and back into work"".
Sectors like hospitality where 81% have been furloughed or made redundant, could take a while to recover, she said, arguing that the Â£20 should remain long enough ""to see people through that process and to a place where they can work themselves out of poverty the other side"".
Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, urged the government ""to see sense"" as removing the uplift would mean ""taking Â£1,000 a year from Britain's families at the peak of the unemployment crisis"".
""This crisis has highlighted how important it is that we support each other but the Conservatives expect the poorest households to shoulder the burden,"" said Mr Reynolds.
A government spokesperson said: ""We are wholly committed to supporting people on lower incomes and have paid out more than Â£100bn in welfare support this year.
""The Â£20 increase to universal credit continues to be in place until the end of March 2021."""

"Academics travel a lot. Whether for fieldwork or conferences, we’re often encouraged to do it. Often internationally, invariably by aeroplane. But while globetrotting might make us feel important, a recent study suggests there’s no connection between academic air-miles and career advancement. With the obvious realities of the climate crisis, and with air travel being the single quickest way an average person can contribute to climate change, some academics are trying to stay on the ground whenever possible. Within a broader campaign to encourage people to go “flight-free”, there’s a community of academics challenging the reliance on flying that’s typically sat uneasily at the heart of their careers. I’m a member of that community. I pledged not to fly in 2019 and 2020, and then won a fellowship to study Chinese attitudes to sustainability which required me to go to China for fieldwork. Suddenly, the consequences of my pledge became very real. When I told my managers that I intended to get to China by train, I was met with a mixture of responses. Some thought I was mad, some admired my principles, some thought I was an awkward bugger. Maybe they were all right. In any case, what I was doing had certainly created more work for myself. I began trying to convince senior staff to release funds from my research budget to arrange visas, and thinking through the nitty-gritty of a trip across Europe, Russia and a big chunk of China itself. The cost of the trains was over £2,000, dwarfing the £700 I could pay for a London to Beijing return flight. Time-wise, the train trip took just under two weeks each way. But in terms of carbon emissions my trip was a steal, contributing just 10% of the emissions of the equivalent flights. The cost, complexity and discomfort of such a long solo trip did occasionally make me wonder if it wouldn’t just be easier to fly (answer: it would). But I was determined to honour my pledge and show other academics – by my own extreme example – that it is possible to do international work without flights. Considering it involved 21 train connections, my journey went surprisingly smoothly. I took a series of “short” trips from Southampton, changing in London, Brussels, Cologne, Berlin and then onto my first sleeper train from Warsaw to Kiev (avoiding Belarus which would have required another visa).  My first experience on the Kiev-bound, Soviet-style sleeper train was something of a shock. Unsure of the etiquette when sharing a tiny cabin with two or three others with limited English, I soon learned that body language, Google translate and sharing food breaks the ice. Luckily, my no-flying trip was a recurring source of conversation, fascination and bafflement for many of my fellow travellers. After one night in Kiev, I took another overnight train to Moscow. Russia was something of a test – on my return journey I travelled 2,600 miles between Irkutsk and Moscow, spending 90 hours on a single train. Had this not been a work trip, I would have gladly stopped more often. Making friends with fellow passengers – mainly Russians on work trips or family visits, or European and Chinese tourists doing the bucket list Trans-Siberian route – certainly helped pass the time. The Siberian scenery – millions of trees on a seemingly endless loop – became somewhat repetitive, but the monotony afforded me time to read, write, plan and contemplate. The most spectacular journey was the Trans-Mongolian section, passing the edge of Lake Baikal, the world’s largest lake rimmed with snow-capped mountains, over the green steppes of northern Mongolia, across the Gobi desert, and finally through the mountainous valleys encircling Beijing. It’s hard not to be awed and inspired that these train lines exist in such remote parts of our planet. China now has more high-speed railways than the rest of the world combined, and they do it in style. Beijing to Shanghai, a trip covering 1,300km, takes less than four and a half hours, with a solid internet connection throughout and the most legroom I enjoyed on any of my trips. The downer is that China’s electrified trains will, like most of their electricity, be powered by coal. But on the upside, these trains are likely to take passengers off domestic flights – a lesson for Europe and the US.  I enjoyed using them to visit my other field sites in Hangzhou and Ningbo before finally retracing my steps back, over 6,000 miles to the UK, clutching a load of new data, a heap of memories, and a sore back. The focus group data I collected in China, with members of their urban middle classes, has enforced my view that both ‘bottom-up’ social and cultural pressure, as well as “top-down” infrastructure and fiscal policy will be required in any country facing up the complex challenges of climate change. I admit that my story is somewhat privileged – not everyone can take the train to China for work, and I doubt I’ll make a habit of it. Much depends on geography too. The UK is relatively well connected by surface transport options like rail, but many still fly - the UK has the third largest air passenger market, behind only the US and China.  The bigger policy goal is to make train tickets less expensive relative to flights. In the meantime, academics can play a leadership role, both individually and institutionally. Universities could consider publishing records of staff flights, building low-carbon travel modes into grant proposals by default, and making videoconferencing facilities fantastic.  Recent research has shown, unsurprisingly, that climate researchers are taken more seriously if they practise what they preach. If we can lead by example in reducing our own flying carbon footprints while still conducting great research, then others – students, policymakers and other professionals – are far more likely to take notice.

Prof. Ziegler made a tremendous contribution to the fields of geology, energy, climate and our understanding of how the planet evolved.
Arthur Rörsch of the Netherlands has written the following notice:
Dear all,
In memoriam Prof. (em.) Dr Dr (hc.) Peter A. Ziegler
We were very sad to learn that the eminent scientist and amiable colleague Peter Ziegler passed away at his home in Switzerland on July 19th, 2013. He was recently the guest editor of the special E&E issue on “The AGW concept; a critical review”; E&E  24 (3,4) 2013. Until his last hour he continued to work on the follow-up he hoped that this publication would receive in the scientific community. He spent almost all day during a whole year on the preparation for this volume. He criticised all manuscripts very thoroughly but never lost his patience in the discussions with the authors.
His career consists of 33 years as exploration geologist with the petroleum industry, 30 of which with Shell, and 20 years of university teaching and research. He published widely in international journals and thematic volumes on processes controlling extensional and compressional intraplate tectonics and on the evolution of the lithosphere.

In 1992 he was appointed as Honorary Lecturer at the University of Basel and in 1996 as Titular Professor for Global Geology. He was awarded Honorary Doctor Degrees by the Moscow State University (1997) and the Technical University Delft (2001).
He was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and the Academia Europaea
He was a life member of the Bureau of the International Lithosphere Program and an honorary member of the Geological Society of London, the European Union of Geoscientists, the Geological Society of Poland and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.
He received medal distinctions from the Belgian Geological Society, the Royal Geological and Mining Society of the Netherlands, the Geological Society of London, the Geological Society of Glasgow, the Geosciences Union, the German Geological Society and the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences.
He will be remembered by all his colleagues as a very gifted and critical scientist, with a broad interest in the natural sciences. He was continuously helpful to others without self-interest.”
There’s absolutely no doubt that Prof. Ziegler’s lifetime work has made a extremely positive impact on human living conditions and that this will be felt by future generations for years to come.

"The evidence of the climate crisis is now undeniable. But state responses to climate change often have social and political motivations, rather than addressing the realities of this threat. Since the 1980s, preventative action has been internationally stifled by the industrial agenda of a conservative political agenda which has maintained intensive subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. There has been a backlash against this lack of impetus in recent times by groups such as Extinction Rebellion, which highlights the need for significant action by wealthy Global North states. These wealthy, industrialised nations – and about 100 corporations largely headquartered within them – have been the largest drivers of climate change via fossil fuel emissions, while baulking at global agreements to provide meaningful climate aid to developing countries. The idea of drowning or sinking islands has long existed as a way to describe future risks that small island states must confront. But the reality is that these threats affect life in such places today. Many small islands states have chosen to reintroduce previously unpopular resettlement and migration policies in the face of climate change.  This is the story of Kiritimati (pronounced Ki-ri-si-mas) in the Pacific – the largest coral atoll in the world. A closer look at the story of this particular island sheds light on the issues facing those living on such islands all around the world, and the inadequacy of current international policy. Kiritimati has a dark past of British colonialism and nuclear weapons testing. It gained independence from the UK on July 12 1979, when the Republic of Kiribati was established. Now a complex threat is appearing over the horizon.

      The atomic history of Kiritimati – a tiny island where humanity realised its most lethal potential


 Raised no more than two metres above sea level at its highest point, Kiritimati is one of the most climate vulnerable inhabited islands on the planet. Inadequate action is being taken to protect the people who live there. It is at the centre of the world, yet most people could not pinpoint it on a map, and know little about the rich culture and traditions of its people.  This culture may be set to disappear. One in seven of all movements in Kiribati – whether between islands or internationally – are attributed to environmental change (14%). And a 2016 UN report has shown that half of households have already been affected by sea level rise in Kiritimati. Rising sea levels also pose challenges to the storage of nuclear waste on small island states – a hangover from the island’s colonial past. Those who have moved become climate change refugees: people who has been forced to leave their home due to the effects of severe climate events and to rebuild their lives in other places, having lost their culture, community, and decision-making power. This problem will only intensify. Since 2008, intensifying storms and weather-related events have displaced more than 24m people around the world annually, and the World Bank estimates that another 143m people will be displaced by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America. In Kiritimati, a few mechanisms have been created to help islanders. For example, the Kiribati government has implemented a programme, “Migration with Dignity”, with the aim of creating a skilled workforce able to find good employment abroad. The government has also purchased 6,000 acres on Fiji in 2014 to try and ensure food security as the environment changes. New Zealand has also created an annual opportunity lottery called the Pacific Access Ballot. This lottery is presented as a way for 75 Kiribati citizens per year to resettle in New Zealand. But quotas are not being filled. Understandably, people do not want to leave their homes, families and lives.  The World Bank and the UN, meanwhile, have argued that Australia and New Zealand should improve mobility for seasonal workers and allow open migration for citizens of Kiritimati, in light of climate change affects. But seasonal work is often menial and offers few prospects for a better life.  While well-intentioned international policy is predominantly focused simply on relocation, rather than providing adaptive capacity and long-term support, these options still do not offer true self-determination for the people of Kiritimati. They tend to commodify people, reducing their relocation to reemployment plans.  It also means that beneficial local projects, such as the new airport, a permanent housing programme and a new marine tourism strategy could soon become redundant. Realistic and affordable strategies to reclaim and maintain the island’s land are needed to prevent migration from becoming a necessity.  Encouraging the population to migrate is of course the option with the lowest costs. But we should not fall into the trap of thinking it is the only option. We don’t need to allow this island to drown.  This is not just a human issue – abandoning this island to the sea would also eventually condemn a bird species found nowhere else on earth, the bokikokiko, to global extinction. Other small island states whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels are also home to species at risk of extinction. The Marshall Islands, for example, are home to the coconut crab, which can only be hunted and eaten by the local inhabitants. International aid could resolve many future problems and preserve this astonishing and beautiful place for humans, nonhuman animals and plants, but the lack of support from wealthy nations makes options like this difficult for residents of small island states to consider. Artificial islands have been created in Dubai – why not here? Many other hard engineering options exist, such as coastal fortification and land reclamation technologies. Such options could protect the homeland of the Kiritimati people while also enhancing the resilience of these places – if international aid were more readily and consistently available from the nations that have driven this climate crisis.  At the time of writing, there is neither an internationally recognised definition of the climate refugee, nor are they covered by the UN 1951 Refugee Convention. This maintains a protection gap, as environmental degradation is not defined as “persecution”. This is despite climate change arising due to the complacency of industrialised nations, as well as their negligence in combating its stark consequences. The UN Climate Action Summit on September 23 2019 may begin to address some of these challenges. But for the millions of people who live in places that are threatened by climate change, the question is about environmental and climate justice. This question should be not just about whether climate change hazards are being addressed – but why those who want to continue to live on small island states often do not have the resources or autonomy to address climate change and other global challenges themselves."
"**At Christmas, coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends.**
Across the UK, people will be able to form ""bubbles"" of three households over a five-day period. Who can be in your bubble will depend on where you are.
Between 23 and 27 December, the three households in a ""Christmas bubble"" can mix indoors and stay overnight.
Northern Ireland has a window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations.
Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:
The bubbles will be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else.
There will be no limit to the number of people who can join a bubble in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, although the English guidance says it should be ""as small as possible"".
But the Scottish government has said Christmas bubbles should contain no more than eight people. Children under 12 will not count in the total.
The rules about what counts as a household also depend on where you are.
In England if you have formed a support bubble with another household, that counts as one household, so you can join with two other households in a Christmas bubble.
The Scottish government guidance says any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"".
People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate.
You will still be able to see other people who are not in your bubble outside your home, subject to the rules of the tier where you are staying.
Travel restrictions will be lifted to allow people to visit their families anywhere in the UK.
But the government has warned that there will not be extra public transport laid on.
It has urged people to plan their travel in advance.
You will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues.
You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying.
Places you can meet include parks, beaches, open countryside, public gardens, allotments and playgrounds.
Some traditional Christmas activities will also be allowed in England:
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation of restrictions will not be extended to cover New Year's Eve.
She said: ""I know New Year is special for people, perhaps slightly more so in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, but the virus is still there.""
The planned firework displays in Edinburgh and London have been cancelled.
The virus will not call a truce because it is Christmas, and will be as contagious as at any other time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.
Even if it is within the rules, meeting friends and family over Christmas will be a ""personal judgement"", the government says.
People should consider the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to use the Christmas rules responsibly and ""only if you think it is necessary"".
Children aged under 18 whose parents live apart are allowed to be part of two separate Christmas bubbles. This means they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household.
University students may return to their parents in the early December ""travel window"" and be counted as part of their household straight away.
But if parents have three or more grown-up children who are not at university, then they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents.
Individual households can split for Christmas. So, if three people are sharing a home, they can all go and form separate Christmas bubbles with their families and come back to form a single household again afterwards.
In England, care home residents have been told not to take part in Christmas bubbles, while visits out of the home should only be considered by residents who are of ""working age"". This is because of the increased risk of the resident catching coronavirus, and spreading it to other vulnerable people when they return, the government says.
People are asked to consider whether visiting at the care home would ""provide meaningful contact in a safer way"", while residents who do leave will be tested and asked to isolate when they return."
"

It was a tough decision. So many are terrible.



 **  
RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.





 **Upper Harbour Local Board**



There are 14 candidates for this 6 seat Local Board. You have up to 6 votes



 **Anna Atkinson –** Living Upper Harbour **$$$$**



This two-member ticket has been very helpful in ensuring we don’t confuse them with any dead Upper Harbour candidates.



Anna’s profile is pretty bland and featureless. Google tells me virtually nothing.



She has been a chartered accountant for 20 years so will enjoy the boredom of Local Board meetings and she appears to understand what Local Boards can actually do.



 **Uzra Casuri Balouch $**  




Uzra is an incumbent board member with decades of business experience. As an incumbent board member, she is well aware of the limits of what a local board can achieve. To say that she will build infrastructure such as a library and a multi-storey car park at Albany Park and Ride is sneaky. Local Boards don’t have capital budgets on that scale and Albany Park n Ride is AT property. She can advocate for capital projects to the council, budgeted out of the ten-year plan as the other 20 local boards do but that’s it. Uzra should know this.



Assisting youth into work is complete horse-feathers. Local Boards don’t do that and councils shouldn’t either. Also wants consultation with _“diverse communities in development decisions. Preserve the heritage, character and natural environment of our communities like Bomb Point (sic)”_



Duplicitous, with NIMBY painted all over her.



 **Mary-Anne Benson-Cooper**  




Mary-Anne is like a problem gambler buying 100 tickets for the Powerball Jackpot. Upper Harbour is one of three Local Boards she is standing for. It is only possible to be elected to one, so if she is elected to more than one, she decides which one to turn down.



She promises lots of advocacy and aid to community groups and volunteers. She opposes any park sales.



 **Callum Blair –** Independent **$$$**



Blair was a councillor on the North Shore City Council 2007-2010 and elected to the Upper Harbour Local Board following the amalgamation. He has previously been an advocate for the construction of municipal pools. I know it is counted as recreation and therefore a core function but surely is better left to the private sector?



He is concerned at the decline in funding allocations for Upper Harbour and indicates they deserve more.



He has also been a candidate for the Conservative Party.



 **Jaggar Bootten –** Independent **$**  




Bootten looks like a teenager and I don’t want to look like I’m bullying young people. However, I first ran for parliament at 19 and got treated like any other candidate. He will suck it up.



His [campaign video](https://www.facebook.com/JaggarBootten/?eid=ARAJzPc4imxNMyPW2GrMt3to8Je19uo-NpRZt2FOAHYaZMpT-lN8oOAeu81ja8FMAPaE3t0XrZOtfAoq) is right out of the Jacinda Ardern playbook. Leaning forward, raised eyebrows, rehearsed empathy. If there were an election for kindy teacher, I’d rate him $$$$$ (despite the salary being $). He trots out the line about 42% of people in the area being under 30 with nobody on Local Board being under that age.  
  
Of course, it is identitarian nonsense. Nobody working for the Ministry for Children is an actual child but we don’t claim that is a bad thing.



He supports sustainable rate changes, more affordable housing and will ensure accountability for council spending. I hope if he stands again in 2022, he works out what Local Boards actually do.



 **John Glover $$**



His [candidate profile](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b78d098a-3d85-41e8-829e-0ac02d4675fb&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Upper%20Harbour%20Local%20Board) is fluff and womble. He would “invest in people rather than footpaths to nowhere.” Then he complains about an absence of footpaths.  
  
I think he likes footpaths. He wants a diverse mix of people around the local board table but he’s a white male so I don’t know if he’s telling people not to vote for him, is taking the piss or a bleeding heart liberal.



With a building and construction background, I’m going to take a stab in the dark and hope he’s taking the piss.



 **John Loau –** Independent **$$**



So far, the line-up looks pretty bleak. John wants to keep Bomb Point Park a park and smarter and efficient solutions around public transport and planning. Those are buzz words I like though anyone can use them.



 **Nicholas Mayne –** Living Upper Harbour **$$**



I’ve met Nicholas on several occasions. We both ran in Upper Harbour in 2014 and East Coast Bays 2017 general elections. He’s a fundamentalist Christian, union delegate and a Green party member. I’m neither but my interactions with him point to him being a decent bloke. 



Nicholas is an incumbent and says his achievements include a review of Upper Harbour’s Play Spaces and Path Network, plans for a new playground in Greenhithe, increased community participation in ecological restoration projects and progress on a Pest-Free Strategy. That looks like a lot of looking but very little doing.



He hopes to achieve more in his next term by making “Smart Equitable Decisions.”



Equitable. Hmm.



 **Jonathan McDonald**  




Thinks I’m going to tick some boxes. Taking Action to Combat Climate Change (hence why he won’t put up corflute signage or deliver leaflets). He’s wrong.  
  
I suspect he simply has no money and fear he will minimise waste by abolishing voting papers.  




 **John McLean $$$**



He has previously been Chairman of the Albany Community Board and is currently on Upper Harbour Local Board. I’m split because his candidate profile looks awesome but most of it isn’t related to Local Board functions. He will be fully aware of this.



  
“Long history of Community service, Local Government representation, NZ Scouting, Chairman Albany CoCo, former Trustee Albany Senior High School, FFS Charity, Hearing Commissioner for Auckland Council.



Cut out waste. Seek greater efficiency. Rates should be indexed to CPI and a regime focusing on results. Transaction costs should be reduced, innovation is needed and new projects critically tested against ‘needs vs wants.’



John offers strong advocacy tempered by affordability and common sense. Lack of infrastructure is causing traffic congestion and gridlock. Lack of infrastructure is at the heart of Auckland’s growth and Housing affordability is essential to regional growth. Albany anticipates 4600 new homes so continued intensification requires strong mitigation.



The RMA needs overhaul. The Auckland Plan must remain affordable, responsive to a City with burgeoning growth, safe for its families and citizens and new arrivals alike.”



 **Margaret Miles –** Independent **$$$**



Margaret is an accredited Resource Management Act Commissioner. That would make her competent on Local Board but I’m not sure how.



Has a QSM for community service and is concerned that Upper Harbour rates are disproportionality being spent outside of the area.



 **Brian Neeson –** Independent ****



Some of you may recall that Neeson got the boot from the National Party to make room for John Key. Neeson has listed nothing that the Board has achieved and a loooooong list of the things he says still need to be done. That includes supporting local business opportunities (not his job).



Think it is time Neeson found something else to do. It’s been time for 17 years.



 **Glen Stanton –** Independent **$**



I covered him in the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board. 



**Lisa Whyte $$$$$**



Lisa Whyte has been in local body politics for fifteen years and as far as I can see, is very effective. Multiple community facilities have been refurbished, a new septic system for Whenuapai Village Hall was funded (while the land owner, Auckland Council, continued to pay for monthly pumping of this dying utility). Smart free-wifi solutions for parks sponsored by private companies (though some were quashed by bloody Auckland Council) are amongst those achievements. It’s a pity she hasn’t put her name forward for council again, after being beaten on the Auckland Future ticket in 2016.  
  
Worth her weight in gold.



 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** I’ve had to put a lot of thought into this one. You have up to 6 votes in this FPP contest.

"**New Covid guidance for hospitals could see more patients receiving face-to-face visits from loved ones.**
NHS Wales has given health boards and hospices flexibility to allow visits based on local levels of Covid-19.
Until now accompanying people to medical appointments and hospital visits have not been allowed, with a few exceptions.
It also allows for pregnant women in low Covid rate areas to take their partners to maternity appointments.
The Welsh Government said the new flexibility was ""due to the changing picture of coronavirus transmission across Wales, with significant variations in community transmission across different parts of the country and differences in the rate of nosocomial transmission"".
Room sizes, the ability to social distance and infection prevention and control will all be considered when considering visits to maternity wards.
Chief nursing officer for Wales, Jean White, said for women in very low areas of transmission ""it would almost be like it was before Covid"".
Angharad Phillips from Cardiff was on a maternity ward waiting to give birth to her first child as the first lockdown in Wales was announced in March.
""I just remember lots of women breaking down and crying quite loudly and wailing,"" she said.
The mum of eight month old Eli Gwen considers herself lucky to have had partner Gareth present at the birth but said it was both emotionally and physically difficult when he had to leave 20 minutes after she came out of surgery.
""I had an epidural and so I was immobile and having to pick baby up, shuffle to the edge of the bed, pick her up for feeding and changing when I was struggling already myself,"" she said.
The 37-year-old, who discharged herself after three days on the ward, said leaving was also surreal.
""It was very much like a chemical warzone. I remember being escorted down off the ward and my partner waiting outside...we looked at each other through the glass,"" she said.
""I remember thinking this is really bizarre and emotional, I just wanted to run and hug him.""
She said she was hugely relieved to learn there will be more flexibility for other families so they can ""go through that special moment together"".
Ms White said the most noticeable changes would be to maternity services.
""So for a very high risk (area) you may say the woman would only have support during childbirth and the very limited amount of contact with partner in the various stages,"" she said.
""In a very low area you would almost be like it was before Covid, you would have partner at most appointments and they would be able to stay longer...and allow more visiting and interaction.""
In other health areas, Ms White said the biggest change was the introduction of essential support assistants.
""If you're coming into hospital for appointments or you're going to be an inpatient, you can have somebody with you, whether that's because you have difficulty understanding information if you need an interpreter, or if you actually need some psychological support for you to cope, you're able to nominate that person.
""It could be a family member.""
Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he recognised that the restrictions on visiting has a huge impact on patients, their families and loved ones.
""It is important to remember that the virus has not gone away and the health, safety and wellbeing of patients, communities and NHS staff remain an absolute priority for both the Welsh Government and health care providers,"" he added.
The director of the Welsh NHS Confederation Darren Hughes said it was ""only right that we have the flexibility based on local circumstances in terms of visitors to hospitals where it is safe to do so"".
He added: ""This change gives our members the opportunity to take sensible, evidence-based precautions where necessary and it will also be a boost to patients and families who are desperate to support their loved ones.""
Nadia Higson, from the maternity charity AIMS, said any relaxation was going to be ""very welcome"".
""We've had a lot of calls and a lot of emails from people feeling extremely stressed about the fact that they are having to attend appointments on their own,"" she said.
""And the kind of situations [they discuss] are potentially going along and hearing bad news about their baby, potentially hearing that the sonographer can't hear the baby's heartbeat.""
She added: ""The more that partners are able to be involved to be supporting the women, and be involved themselves in the pregnancy, that can only be good."""

From Duke University and the Department of Obvious Science  comes this study partially funded by NASA:
Standing trees better than burning ones for carbon neutrality
DURHAM, N.C. — The search for alternatives to fossil fuels has prompted growing interest in the use of wood, harvested directly from forests, as a carbon-neutral energy source.
But a new study by researchers at Duke and Oregon State universities finds that leaving forests intact so they can continue to store carbon dioxide and keep it from re-entering the atmosphere will do more to curb climate change over the next century than cutting and burning their wood as fuel.

“Substituting woody bioenergy for fossil fuels isn’t an effective method for climate change mitigation,” said Stephen R. Mitchell, a research scientist at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment. Wood stores only about half the amount of carbon-created energy as an equivalent amount of fossil fuels, he explained, so you have to burn more of it to produce as much energy.
“In most cases, it would take more than 100 years for the amount of energy substituted to equal the amount of carbon storage achieved if we just let the forests grow and not harvest them at all,” he said.
Mitchell is lead author of the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy. Mark E. Harmon and Kari E. O’Connell of Oregon State University co-authored the study.
Using an ecosystem simulation model developed at Oregon State, the team calculated how long it would take to repay the carbon debt – the net reduction in carbon storage – incurred by harvesting forests for wood energy under a variety of different scenarios.
Their model accounted for a broad range of harvesting practices, ecosystem characteristics and land-use histories. It also took into account varying bioenergy conversion efficiencies, which measure the amount of energy that woody biomass gives off using different energy-generating technologies.
“Few of our combinations achieved carbon sequestration parity in less than 100 years, even when we set the bioenergy conversion factor at near-maximal levels,” Harmon said. Because wood stores less carbon-created energy than fossil fuels, you have to harvest, transport and burn more of it to produce as much energy. This extra activity produces additional carbon emissions.
“These emissions must be offset if forest bioenergy is to be used without adding to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the near-term,” he said.
Performing partial harvests at a medium to low frequency – every 50 to 100 years or so – could be an effective strategy, O’Connell noted, but would generate less bioenergy.
“It’s a Catch-22,” she said. “Less intensive methods of harvesting release fewer emissions but yield less energy. The most intensive methods, such as clear-cutting, produce more energy but also release more carbon back into the atmosphere, prolonging the time required to achieve carbon sequestration parity.”
Given current economic realities and the increasing worldwide demand for forest products and land for agriculture, it’s unlikely that many forests will be managed in coming years solely for carbon storage, Mitchell said, but that makes it all the more critical that scientists, resource managers and policymakers work together to maximize the carbon storage potential of the remaining stands.
“The take-home message of our study is that managing forests for maximal carbon storage can yield appreciable, and highly predictable, carbon mitigation benefits within the coming century,” Mitchell said. “Harvesting forests for bioenergy production would require such a long time scale to yield net benefits that it is unlikely to be an effective avenue for climate-change mitigation.”

The research was funded by a NASA New Investigator Program grant to Kari O’Connell, by the H.J. Andrews Long-term Ecological Research Program, and by the Kay and Ward Richardson Endowment.

"Pity the poor consumer who wants to make informed decisions about eating cod. Conflicting reports on the state of cod stocks range from misinterpretation of the science – such as the Telegraph’s story that there were only 100 adult cod left in the North Sea (the correct figure was around 21 million) – to misunderstanding over the state of cod stocks in different territorial waters. The North East Arctic cod stock is currently booming and provides much of the cod consumed in the UK, while the North-west Atlantic cod fishery which collapsed 20 years ago has not yet recovered, and several other cod stocks remain at historically low levels. Fisheries management is complex, and reporting filled with errors and omissions only adds to consumers’ confusion. Television programme Masterchef stirred up a fuss this week after its website pointed viewers to the Marine Conservation Society’s guidelines for sustainably harvested fish. Scottish trawlermen were reported to be angered by the MCS’s classification of cod from the Irish and North Seas and from the west of Scotland as a “fish to avoid”. While the MCS does place cod from these waters into its highest danger category, the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation chief executive, Bertie Armstrong, said: Scottish fishing has tried extremely hard to be sustainable. Our beef about the Marine Conservation Society traffic light list of guidance is that it is superficial and illogical. If anybody buys fish in the United Kingdom then it has been fished within a quota and is entirely sustainable. That’s the measure of it. In fact the SFF comments referred only to North Sea cod, and not to the Irish or west of Scotland stocks as implied in the Guardian’s reporting. So, cod or no cod? No wonder the fish-eating public is confused. European fisheries management advice is provided by the International Commission for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) which bases its assessments on data from commercial fish landings and from research surveys. These data are used to reconstruct trends in historic stock size and fishing mortality and to forecast what the stock will do over the next few years at different levels of harvest. From the huge amount of publicly available reports available from ICES, here are charts showing the trends in cod spawning biomass in the North Sea, Irish Sea and to the west of Scotland. If the weight of mature fish in a stock (the spawning stock biomass) is reduced to too low a level it will not be able to replace the number of fish removed by fishing and natural predation. However, fish stocks cannot increase indefinitely due to natural ecological limits, an ecosystem’s “carrying capacity”. There is therefore an optimal amount of mature spawning fish which generate the maximum surviving offspring. If harvest rates are adjusted so that the spawning stock biomass is at this value then the fishing is said to be at “maximum sustainable yield”, and achieving this is the aim of current fisheries policy in many countries. So is North Sea cod being “sustainably harvested” at current levels? It depends what we mean by “sustainable fishing”. However, the widely accepted definition for a stock which has recovered, and so is sustainable in the long-term, is when the level of removals allows the spawning stock biomass to be at the level which will give maximum sustainable yields. According to the ICES estimates, fishing mortality on cod in the North Sea is currently still above this level. So regardless of a legal quota of cod for fishers to land, fishing mortality is still too high and the cod stock size in the North Sea is not yet at the level which will allow a long-term maximum sustainable yield. However, the quotas being set should allow the North Sea stock to continue to rebuild over time – they are not set so high that overfishing is likely to cause a further decline in the spawning stock biomass. It is certainly true that the UK industry has worked hard for many years to try and ensure that cod stocks recover. Many of the measures adopted have involved sacrifices from the industry, including the decommissioning of vessels, introduction of fishing gear modifications to reduce the by-catch of small cod and actions to avoid areas where young cod congregate. It seems these efforts are beginning to have some effect in the North Sea, as the stock assessment shows the amount of mature adults is now rising. In contrast there has been only limited improvement in the Irish Sea, and none at all in the west of Scotland. Why these stocks are not improving, compared with the North Sea cod, is not clear. Possible reasons include interactions with other fisheries, environmental changes or increased natural predation. There is no clear scientific answer yet although there is evidence of environmental changes such as rising sea temperature and changes to plankton. It has been suggested that these changes could be affecting the survival rates of young cod in particular, but there is no definitive proof. The steady recovery of cod in the North Sea since 2009 does show that the stocks can respond positively, but does this mean the Marine Conservation Society should change its consumer advice? If one accepts the targets for a recovered stock associated with maximum sustainable yield, then there is clearly still some way to go. Perhaps we need to describe fishing for cod in the North Sea at present levels as fishing ‘responsibly’, rather than ‘sustainably’. This would both acknowledge the vital role that the industry is playing in re-building the stock but also acknowledge that this stock is not yet at the level we want to see for long-term sustainability."

In 2016 naive millennials lapped up the Greens’ environmental policy, and they continue to congratulate themselves for saving the environment. 



“We love Aotearoa and we want to protect it. Our kids have a birth right to swim in clean rivers, fish in the sea, and walk in pristine forests.



“ **Our Environment Policy protects New Zealand’s natural heritage from exploitation of finite resources for short term profit, such as industrial dairying & open-cast mining. **



“ **Real prosperity means clean rivers and air, rich biodiversity, and protected marine areas.”**



  
The Greens have a warped view of prosperity. In their zeal for the environment, they did not spare a thought for us who would wear the knock-on effects of their flawed policies. 



Protecting the environment is necessary – but not at the price the Greens have forced us to pay, which is beyond reasonable.



They have infiltrated the education system to ensure that the next generation of voters is brainwashed about man-made climate change to support their foolhardy goals.



The Greens gave us the Emissions Trading Scheme and the Zero Carbon Bill, which are crippling our farming industry. In their urge to get cars off the road and us onto bicycles and public transport, they scrapped highways planned by the previous government. Congestion is now a way of life and contributes to increased transport costs that push up prices.



The Greens support the flawed RMA process with red tape that ties up development and skyrockets building costs. Business confidence has plummeted.



We must challenge them because their price tag to save the planet is unacceptable. The cost is increased unemployment and hungry, sick and homeless people. 



They simply can’t help themselves colouring everything with climate change as demonstrated in their policy **“Love New Zealand Fiscal Plan”.**



The goals of our plan are:  
 **To make New Zealand a world leader in the global fight against climate change.**



 **To restore and replenish our forests, our birds and our rivers.**  
To end poverty and create an inclusive Aotearoa. 



  
The Greens put the environment ahead of people and have forced New Zealand into a downward slide of financial failure.

"For all the huge, hulking buildings of concrete and steel that house coal, gas or nuclear power stations, or towering 100-metre-tall wind turbines, generating electricity is in fact a very precise and quite delicate business.  Just small fluctuations in an electric current can wreak serious damage. Fortunately, the means of generating electricity provides its own protection against this. Unfortunately, the renewable energy technology we will use now and for the future removes this protection – with potentially disastrous results. Electricity is created by generators – rotating electromagnets that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. In order to power an entire nation’s electricity grid, they must all be tuned to spin at the same speed. In the UK, this speed is a frequency of 50Hz – in other words, every electricity generator in the UK spins at 50 rotations per second, or 3,000rpm.  Even a relatively small deviation from 50Hz could destroy electrical equipment, result in blackouts, or even total grid failure. National Grid, the operating company responsible for maintaining the UK electricity supply, is obliged to prevent the grid frequency from moving by any more than just 1Hz in either direction, save in exceptional circumstances. Fortunately the spinning rotors of each generator carry their own inertia – an object’s tendency, after a force has been applied to it, to continue in motion even after the force is no longer applied. Taken together, the combined inertia of all of the nation’s electricity generators is extremely useful for maintaining stability. The loss of a large power station can mean an instant imbalance between electricity generation and electricity demand, by a gigawatt or more. The common reason is a fault that automatically trips a power plant offline for safety reasons, but equally the same would apply due to terrorist attack or natural disaster. For example, in 2008 two large UK power plants tripped within minutes of each other, resulting in blackouts. So when this immediate and major loss of electricity occurs, the first line of defence against a dangerous drop in system frequency that could lead to total grid failure is the inertia of the system. The inertia of all those rotating generators keep the system going at 50Hz, providing  valuable seconds with which to respond to the imbalance (in 2008, balance was restored by choosing to temporarily shut down parts of the grid). Without an immediate response, the system would collapse and need a full reboot (known as a “black start”), which would take days to restore power. Imagine a national power cut: no electricity at home or work. No internet, street lights, or transport logistics. No heating. Huge economic losses. Astute readers may disagree with the claim that every electricity generator rotates at 3,000rpm – what about wind turbines? And rightly so – a wind turbine rotating at 3,000rpm would be a sight to behold. A more refined statement is that conventional generators (think nuclear, coal, gas and oil) provide inertia while “asynchronous” generators, where the speed of rotation is dependent on the strength of the wind or tide, do not. In fact there are sources of electricity, like solar power or electricity imported from undersea high voltage cables, with no physical rotation at all. And so it should become clear that deploying this kind of energy generation poses a challenge. The more asynchronous generation in the system, the less inertia is available to provide valuable time in the event of a fault. This is becoming a problem, particularly in places where renewables make up a considerable proportion of the energy mix. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland together have a target of 40% renewable electricity by 2020 and are on course to achieve it. But concerns over system inertia have led to a cap of 50% of demand on asynchronous, renewable forms of energy generation. In other words, if wind and solar generate more than half the demand, that excess is dumped and wasted. This solution is untenable in the long run. It’s inefficient to hold back zero-carbon, zero-fuel-cost electricity for the sake of running expensive and carbon-intensive fossil fuel power plants. Politically, it’s embarrassing, but there are ways around this – and some countries are taking the lead. System operators need to recognise that renewables can still add to system inertia through clever use of power electronics to supply a synthetic inertia that does the same job. The inertia of rotating generators can be thought of as additional kinetic energy that is transformed into electrical energy to maintain the frequency. A wind turbine already contains a rotating mass – the blades – so if it can be made to generate more power this will have the same frequency stabilising effect. The turbine controller can adjust the pitch of the blades, usually to ensure they remain at the most efficient speed as the wind changes. So, quickly altering blade pitch to generate more power in response to a failure on the grid would provide a temporary boost to counter a dangerous frequency dip.  The problem is simply one of capital expenditure for the generating company, as the extra control systems cost money – but taking the broader view, ensuring that more renewables do not lower system inertia to dangerous levels provides protection against much greater potential losses. In Germany, the framework is already in place that requires new wind farms to provide synthetic inertia. Another option, if politicians are wary of burdening energy companies with more costs, is energy storage. A lithium-ion battery can provide immediate power within milliseconds of a trip – effectively emulating the effects of conventional inertia, without moving parts. Nor do batteries need to be synchronised with the grid – providing the equivalent service of back-up power stations but without having to inefficiently run power plants at part load.   The solutions to the emerging challenges for electricity generation already exist. The key to unlocking them is to overcome entrenched conservative attitudes in the energy industry, and reassure regulators and system operators that building synthetic inertia into the grid can provide them same level of security, without cramping the deployment of more renewable technologies in the future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you still don’t believe climate models cannot be trusted to predict the future, then watch the following video of a presentation made with humor added by leading expert modeler Prof. Christopher Essex earlier this year. Absolutely worth viewing!

Hat-tip: DirkH
On scientific consensus
Essex quotes a cartoon: “Then we are agreed nine to one that we will say our previous vote was unanimous“.
On Mann’s phony hockey stick
The hockey stick thing was wrong on so many levels, problematic on so many levels…”
Search for “smoking gun” began already in early 1980s
In the early 1980s Prof. Essex got a post doc at the Canadian Climate Center with the general circulation model group who had a desire “to do some definitive things“. Essex recalls:
Some big wheels there sat me down in this room and said we want you to come up with the smoking gun that will prove global warming.”
So clearly, from the very beginning, this was all about putting mankind on the dock.
“Welcome to wonderland”

But Essex told them it wasn’t possible. Indeed it is not only Essex who believes models cannot describe the complex climate system. At the 7:35 mark he quotes the “ultimate skeptic position” – from the IPCC!
In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
Even the IPCC admitted in 2001 that models were nothing but “wonderland”. Over the course of the presentation, Essex explains why this is so.
At the end of the presentation his comments in the Q&A session are most interesting.
“It’s running out of gas”…”just craziness”
On how long policymakers can continue this “Welcome to Wonderland” climate modeling, Essex thinks “it’s running out of gas” and called some of the things going on in climate science and reactions to legitimate academic inquiry “just craziness”. He thinks that  a lot of people have their lives and careers invested in it but that it will eventually run its course.
I think the overall momentum is gone and they aren’t going to be able to gin it up again quite the way they had.”
What’s going to replace the climate modeling madness?
Some new madness. Yeah. We’re dealing with humans here, you know, I mean, haha, okay.”
Essex is right. But will it be possible to top the madness we’ve seen with the global warming scare? Let’s hope not.

Every time I think I’ve seen the craziest thing yet about global warming mania…along comes something else. From the ANU College of Asia & the Pacific blog, comes this bizarre story from Thailand that shows what lengths a government will go to to slap a global warming fine on farmers.
Since being charged with global warming, villagers have begun working on farms farther from the reserve, harvesting cassava. The man in red was one of the thirteen villagers who was charged along with Ms. Kwanla.
Humans cutting down forest land to farm is nothing new. However, charging rural farmers for causing global warming is. A controversial formula is quantifying the damage villagers have to pay for their small scale farming. Now, the villagers are taking a stand against what they know is wrong.
PHETCHABUN – Early one Thursday morning, a gun was pointed at Ms. Kwanla Saikhumtung, a 34-year-old mother, because she was farming.
The man who pointed the gun was one of ten armed officers from Phu Pha Daeng, the local wildlife sanctuary in Lomsak district. After observing the villagers for three days, the officers finally informed Ms. Kwanla and twelve fellow villagers from Huay Kontha that they were trespassing on wildlife sanctuary land. They demanded that the villagers come to the police station to talk with them.

They refused. The villager that hired them paid taxes on the plot, leading the villagers to believe they had a right to work the land, and they worried about finishing their work.
The officers quickly became annoyed. One threatened to shoot any villager that resisted the officers’ orders.
“Are you really going to shoot? I’m here to harvest the corn, and you want to shoot us?” Ms. Kwanla shouted.  She then bravely grabbed the barrel of the gun, pressed it to her chest, and said, “If you’re going to shoot, shoot.”
The officer lowered his gun. That night, the officers marched the reluctant villagers through the community and drove them to the police station.
This incident was the beginning of a seven-year-long legal battle, pitting Ms. Kwanla against the Thai government. She and the other twelve villagers — the youngest only sixteen at the time — were first charged with trespassing.
The real shock, however, came when they were slapped with a 470,000 baht fine for contributing to global warming under the charge of causing environmental damage.
As the landowner was paying taxes on the plot of land in question, he had the right to grow crops on it. Since Ms. Kwanla and the other villagers had been hired to harvest his corn, it had seemed that they were not breaking the law by being there. However, unknown to the landholder, his plot overlapped with the wildlife sanctuary land.
The Royal Forestry Department (RFD) fined the villagers for cutting down trees and farming, drawing from the 1992 National Environmental Quality Act which forbids “destruction, loss, or damage to natural resources owned by the State.” Their fine was determined according to a formula used to calculate environmental damage. The formula measures the increase in temperature caused by cutting down trees. Any increase in the land temperature shows ‘global warming’. In essence, cutting down trees to farm corn leads to global warming.
The Huay Kontha villagers have a running joke, “Because we pick the corn, the world gets hotter.”
The charges that Ms. Kwanla and the other villagers face shed light on an emerging trend in Thailand. Land dispute issues are becoming increasingly common. According to Pramote Pholpinyo, coordinator of the Northeast Land Reform Network (LRN), there are currently 35-40 “global warming” cases against villagers in Thailand, with charges amounting to almost 33 million baht.

"Barack Obama’s team watched Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech whenever they were “really annoyed” with Tony Abbott, one of the president’s senior advisers has revealed. Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security adviser, has also described how Obama “went way off the script” to blast the Abbott government for climate inaction during a visit to Brisbane for the G20 summit in 2014. For his part, Rhodes described Abbott as being “tone deaf” on the climate issue in the lead-up to the Paris agreement and recalled the former prime minister as being “upset” about the US president’s forceful intervention on protecting the Great Barrier Reef. The behind-the-scenes tension between Obama and Abbott is laid bare in the latest episode of A Rational Fear, a news and politics comedy podcast. In an interview, Rhodes said he and others at the White House had regularly watched the 2012 video of Gillard declaring she would “not be lectured about sexism and misogyny” by Abbott. “I will tell you that whenever we were really annoyed with Tony Abbott, we would watch the video of that speech by Julia Gillard,” Rhodes said. “That speech got watched a lot in the Obama White House, let me just put it that way,” he added with a smile, but did not specify whether the president was one of the viewers. Rhodes said while Obama had been able to work positively with centre-right leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel and Britain’s David Cameron, it was no secret that Abbott was “far from his favourite leader to begin with”. “What was frustrating with Abbott, you know, is he was kind of very sure of himself without really knowing what he was talking about,” Rhodes told the podcast hosts, Dan Ilic and Lewis Hobba. Obama had been “trying to get Australia to do some minimal stuff”, such as setting a target to reduce emissions by 2030 or providing funding for developing countries. At the time, the Guardian reported that Australia was resisting including language in the official G20 communique encouraging countries to make pledges to the Green Climate Fund, instead insisting the focus should be on spurring global economic growth. Rhodes said Obama’s team had prepared a paragraph about climate change for a speech on the sidelines of the G20 but when the president got to that portion “he just went way off the text, and was just basically blasting the Abbott government in ways that he almost never did on foreign soil and pointing out the Great Barrier Reef disappearing”. Obama told an audience at the University of Queensland that global heating threatened “the incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef” and Australia, like the US, had to “step up”. “Abbott was upset,” Rhodes said. “You know, this was supposed to be this big stage for him hosting the G20. “But it’s like, well, look, if you want to host a G20, you’ve got to step up and be an international leader. And we’ve got everybody else kind of rallying around this effort to get to an ambitious climate agreement the next year in Paris, and Abbott was really one of the last holdouts dragging his feet.” Abbott used his own speech to the G20 leaders’ retreat to declare that his government had fulfilled its domestic-policy promises to the Australian people, including “that I would repeal the carbon tax, and that’s gone”. The final Brisbane communique included a call for “strong and effective action” on climate change."

The public school system in the nation’s capital is failing. Teacher incompetence, bureaucratic corruption, crumbling infrastructure, violence, lax academic standards, and wasteful spending are among the litany of problems plaguing the District of Columbia Public Schools. By almost any educational achievement measure, the children attending public schools within the shadow of the U.S. Capitol are not receiving a quality education.



While critics of DCPS tend to focus on the failures of particular superintendents or administrators bedeviled by scandal or incompetence, the failure of the government‐​run school system in the District of Columbia is not new. This failure preceded white flight from the District in the mid‐​1950s and has continued despite inflation‐​adjusted increases in spending, reduced class size, and attempts to reform the system from within. In short, the good old days of public education in the nation’s capital never were.



Contrary to the claims of defenders of the public school system, DCPS does not lack money. Despite having per‐​pupil spending that ranks among the highest in the nation–10,550 for 1999–2000–public school students in the District rank near the bottom on standardized tests and in achievement levels. Although spending has almost tripled since the 1980–81 school year and increased 39 percent since Mayor Anthony Williams took office in 1998, the system lacks qualified teachers, safe facilities, and even basic supplies such as pencils and text‐​books. The system’s leaders demand more money in exchange for more promises of improvement.



To improve education in the nation’s capital, we must consider options beyond spending more money in a system that even supporters acknowledge is troubled. Change must not be limited to propping up the current system. Public schools that are little more than holding pens must not be sheltered from private competition. The city must find a way to create competition within the system, with the goals of giving parents power over the education of their children, fostering an environment that will create a climate for education entrepreneurs to flourish, and taking education out of the hands of feuding politicians.

"Gardeners have been loading up with compost and plants as garden centres have reopened in the UK, except for Scotland. But compost made with peat is still being used by both gardeners and commercial growers, even though it is dug up from peatlands, devastating wild bogplants, wildlife, and sabotaging the fight against the climate crisis. Peat is made up of dead plants saturated and preserved in water, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the plant remains. Peatlands account for about 3% of the Earth’s land area but hold more than one-third of all the carbon in soil, and more than twice as much as the world’s forests. But when peatlands are damaged they release their carbon, some 2bn tonnes of CO2 worldwide annually, more than 5% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions.  Scotland has much of the UK’s peatland, including the largest single expanse of blanket bog in the world, the Flow Country in the far north of Scotland. Much of that peat was devastated by conifer plantations decades ago, but tax breaks that encouraged the tree planting on bogs were abolished in 1988 and in recent years a large area of the bog has been restored by getting rid of the conifer trees and drainage channels, raising the water level and encouraging bog plants to grow back and wildlife to return.

"**The UK must push other countries to ensure that ship crew stranded because of Covid restrictions get home leave this Christmas, a union has said.**
It is estimated that 400,000 seafarers, up to 2,000 of them from the UK, are currently stuck on vessels.
The Nautilus International union wants crew to be classified as key workers in all countries, making it easier to fly them home for time with loved ones.
The government promised to keep making the case for this internationally.
Many of the world's 1.6 million seafarers are working past the end of their contracts, unable to be relieved because of quarantine and travel rules, and a lack of flights.
Some have been on duty for 17 months without a prolonged break.
The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) estimates 400,000 seafarers are stuck on board cruise ships, transporters, tankers and other vessels, and the UK Chamber of Shipping says up to 2,000 of them are from the UK.
The UK government designated seafarers as key workers when the first coronavirus lockdown began in March. Forty-three other maritime countries have done the same - but 130 have not.
""This is an international crisis which requires an international response,"" said Nautilus International general secretary Mark Dickinson. ""All governments need to designate seafarers as key workers and allow them to transit borders and relieve crew.
""Our members work hard to supply food, medicines - and presents - to UK households,"" added Mr Dickinson. ""They often do so without much acknowledgement or public recognition.
""This year, the coronavirus pandemic has given rise to unprecedented levels of stress, fatigue and safety concerns due to countries closing their borders and preventing them from seeing loved ones.""
Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said the UK government had ""led the way"" but been ""let down by other governments across the world"".
In July, the UK hosted the International Maritime Summit on Crew Changes, after which it and 12 other countries called for seafarers of all nationalities to be classed as key workers.
They also recommended greater co-operation between governments on health, immigration and other issues to facilitate crew changes.
ICS secretary-general Guy Platten said the UK could ""not afford to rest on its laurels"", adding: ""The 44 countries who have given seafarers the recognition they deserve have a duty to lobby fellow member states to do the same.""
Mr Platten also urged international cooperation to ensure crew have early access to coronavirus vaccines, so that shipping ""continues to function in 2021 and beyond"".
Maritime Minister Robert Courts said: ""The government has already worked to repatriate over 20,000 crew members from around the world and will continue to work with domestic and international partners to help bring more seafarers home to their loved ones."""

It’s enviro vs. enviro in Washington’s most “progressive” suburb, Takoma Park. Indeed, the _Washington Post_ reports, “a potentially bough‐​breaking debate between sun‐​worshipers and tree‐​huggers.” That is, which is more environmentally desirable, solar power or tree cover? 



The modest gray house in Takoma Park was nearly perfect, from Patrick Earle’s staunchly environmentalist point of view. It was small enough for wood‐​stove heating, faced the right way for good solar exposure and, most important, was in a liberal suburb that embraces all things ecological.   
  
  
Or almost all. When Earle and his wife, Shannon, recently sought to add solar panels to the house, which they have been turning into a sustainability showplace, the couple discovered that Takoma Park values something even more than new energy technologies: big, old trees.   
  
  
When they applied to cut down a partially rotten 50‐​foot silver maple that overshadowed their roof, the Earles ran into one of the nation’s strictest tree‐​protection ordinances. Under the law, the town arborist would approve removing the maple only if the couple agreed to pay $4,000 into a city tree‐​replacement fund or plant 23 saplings on their own.



So now the rival environmentalists are squaring off in front of the city council: 



Takoma Park City Council members, who are considering revising the 1983 tree‐​protection law, listened Monday night as otherwise like‐​minded activists vied to claim the green high ground.   
  
  
Tree partisans hailed the benefits of the leafy canopy that shades 59 percent of the town: Trees absorb carbon, take up stormwater, control erosion and provide natural cooling.…   
  
  
Solar advocates at the hearing said that they are tree lovers, too, but that scientific studies support the idea of poking select holes in the tree cover to let a little sun power through.



Being an environmentalist homeowner can become a full‐​time job: 



But even some veteran solar users don’t like the idea of trading trees for panels. Mike Tidwell, founder of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, installed solar panels on his Takoma Park house 10 years ago. As the trees have grown, the panels’ effectiveness has diminished, and Tidwell now buys wind power credits to supplement them.   
  
  
Still, he said, “I don’t believe you should cut down trees for solar.” Rather, he thinks neighbors should work together to place shared panels on the sunniest roofs.



The city’s “official arborist” turned down Earle’s application to tear down one rotting tree to accommodate his solar panels. Now the council is debating the issue. 



The Earles’ council member, Josh Wright, said he was sympathetic to their plight. He said it should remain hard to cut down a tree, but he’d like to see a break for people installing solar power. Wright also wants all homeowners to get credit for trees they may have planted in the years before they remove a tree.



It all sounds very complicated. And who knows what the right answer is? Or if there is a right answer? Or if the right answer might change next year?   
  
  
And that’s where property rights come in. They allocate both jurisdiction and liability over scarce resources, like roofs, trees, and access to sunlight. A little “law and economics” can help to understand the Takoma Park Tree Tussle. Nobel Laureate in Economics Ronald Coase, who just turned 100, brought law and economics together to study the way that people externalize costs (make others pay for them) or internalize them (take them into account when making decisions). When property rights are well defined and legally secure, and rights can be exchanged at low cost, resources will be directed to their most highly valued use. In fact, the initial allocation of property rights doesn’t affect the allocation of resources, _if_ the transfers are freely and easily negotiable.   
  
  
That, unfortunately, is no longer the case in Takoma Park, where instead of a fairly straightforward transaction (facilitated by a purchase), there is a tussle over ill‐​defined rights and obligations that have little or no legal security, in a very expensive and costly process of negotiation that will almost certainly consume more wood pulp for memos than is contained in the tree in question. Well‐​defined and legally secure property rights save us the rather substantial trouble of sitting down like the Takoma Park City Council and trying to judge the advisability of every proposed purchase, all the while consuming large amounts of paper and exuding large amount of hot air.

"Imagine walking through a lush tropical forest. You hear a rustle overhead, and a half-eaten fruit plops onto the trail. You lock eyes with a howler monkey, before he gives a soft grunt and moves higher into the trees. These magical, fleeting connections with a wild animal can be the highlight of a holiday.  Wildlife tourism like this is booming, raising much-needed funds for and awareness of conservation efforts. However, there is a dark side to this business, and many tourists unknowingly put animals at risk by supporting activities that encourage the capture of wild animals or cause them pain or distress. But that’s not to say you should avoid wildlife tourism altogether – we just need to be more aware of the impact we can have on the lives of wild animals. Here are five ways to ensure that your wildlife holiday encounter contributes to the animals’ conservation and welfare. Animals used for tourist photos are rarely kept in humane conditions, and all have been removed from their normal ecological and social situations. Brown sloths, for example, are common photo props in Central and South America. They are often handled by many people in a single session, and become distressed by having their limbs or head manipulated for a better photo.   Similarly, the slow loris is a frequent prop in Southeast Asia. Bright sunlight is painful for these tiny nocturnal primates, and many have their teeth removed for tourist safety. Meanwhile, in Southern Africa, lion cubs are taken from their mothers and hand-reared so you can snuggle them. Once they are too big for selfies, however, they often enter the canned hunting industry, where hunters pay to kill animals in an enclosed area. This doesn’t mean you can’t take an amazing wildlife photo, however – just keep your hands to yourself and follow advice like the World Animal Protection’s wildlife selfie code, which tells us only to take photos if the animal is in its natural home, at a safe distance, and free to move away. Feeding wildlife leads to a number of serious problems. Sharing food, and even just getting too close, increases the risk of disease transmission between people and animals. Gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans, for example, are susceptible to a number of human infections, including colds and flu, measles, tuberculosis and pneumonia.  A high proportion of human food in primate diets is also linked to poor coat condition and obesity. And when animals learn to expect food from humans, they can become quite bold, which increases the risk of human-animal conflict. Some long-tailed macaques in Bali have even learned which items to steal from tourists in order to “barter” for food.

 Lack of understanding of an animal’s normal behaviour allows tourists to overlook abuse and contributes to human-animal conflict. With their human-like faces and behaviours, primates already teeter on the edge of uncanny valley, so it’s all too easy to misinterpret their expressions and postures. One study found that tourists viewing Barbary macaques struggled to recognise aggressive or distressed facial expressions. However, misinterpretation of monkey faces and postures is one of the surest ways to get yourself bitten. When an animal gives a clear warning and a person does not respond appropriately, it is understandable when bites and scratches occur.  Understanding a bit about animal behaviour can also help you recognise abuse. To keep them docile and safe for tourists, some elephants in Southeast Asia undergo a cruel training process during which they are immobilised and beaten, starved and deprived of water. Working elephants are prohibited from exhibiting their natural behaviours, such as maintaining complex social relationships and ranging many kilometres each day. While you may not know the signs of distress for a species, we can all recognise that wild animals who cannot perform their normal behaviours are not being treated properly.   We can only protect wildlife if we protect their communities, and those communities include people. Responsible wildlife tourism should provide funds for both the people and the animals who live in those environments. So do not give all of your money to international corporations. Stay in locally-owned hotels, try local foods, and embrace the culture of the place you are visiting. The economic impact of tourism can be huge, and making sure your money supports the local area ensures that people have the means to protect their natural treasures in the future. Wildlife tourism success stories from Tanzania, where villages protect wild spaces in exchange for tourist revenues, to Costa Rica, where wildlife tourism creates sustainable, well-paid jobs for local people, show us that economic development can occur alongside wildlife conservation. Tourist income has a lot of power, so choose where to spend your money wisely. If something feels off to you, don’t participate. If you are not sure, consider the situation. Are the animals captive, or are they performing unnatural behaviours? Know that “sanctuaries” or “reserves” may still engage in unethical practices, so research your activities before you go with a reliable organisation like the RPSCA or the Humane Society.  Share your experiences online and let people know which companies are engaging in questionable practices. When we stop buying unethical animal experiences, people will stop selling them as well."
"Tropical cyclones have become more intense around the globe in the past four decades, with more destructive storms forming more often, according to a study that further confirms the theory that warming oceans would drive more dangerous cyclones. Analysis of satellite records from 1979 to 2017 found a clear rise in the most destructive cyclones – also known as hurricanes or typhoons – that deliver sustained winds in excess of about 185km/h.  Australia sits across two ocean basins where cyclones form – the southern Indian Ocean and southern Pacific Ocean – where the study also identified rising trends of the more destructive storms. Experts told Guardian Australia the finding was in line with climate model predictions and the knowledge that increasing ocean temperatures gave tropical storms more energy. Dr Hamish Ramsay, a senior research scientist at CSIRO who studies cyclones, said: “This study confirms what the climate models have been predicting for some time – that the proportion of the most intense storms will increase as the climate warms.” While climate scientists have long-predicted that global heating would deliver stronger cyclones, a trend that was statistically significant has been challenging to identify in part due to the natural swings in the world’s climate masking changes. Published in the leading journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study was carried out by scientists at the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The scientists did not try to find a cause for the increase in more dangerous cyclones, but said the trends were consistent with understanding of physics and modelling, and the finding “increases confidence that [tropical cyclones] have become substantially stronger, and that there is a likely human fingerprint on this increase”. The probability of a cyclone reaching wind speeds greater than 185km/h had risen by about 15% over the 39 years studied. A previous study of the same data had only spanned a shorter period from 1982 to 2009 and, while positive trends had been found, they were statistically not at significant levels, the study said. As well as looking at the number of cyclones forming globally, the study also looked at changes in cyclone intensity by region. The southern Indian Ocean and the southern pacific Ocean both showed an increase in the number of the more intense storms, although the trends in each individual region were not as robust due to the smaller number of cyclones. “[The study] suggests that the climate change signal in the data is potentially already emerging and this is something that climate scientists have been saying for some time,” Ramsay said. “We maybe at a point now where we are starting to evidence from observational data that supports what the models have been telling us.” Ramsay said as well as increasing the wind speeds in cyclones, warming oceans would also likely see cyclones delivering more rainfall. There was still uncertainty as to whether the numbers of all categories of cyclones would rise or fall under climate change. Australia’s 2018 State of the Climate Report said since 1982 there had been a downward trend in the number of all tropical cyclones in the Australian region but it was not possible to see any trend in the intensity of cyclones. Previous research has found that when cyclones form, they are tending to move more slowly, while delivering more rain. Dr Greg Holland, a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, has studied cyclones for about 40 years. The Melbourne-based scientist said while there were legitimate arguments over the finer details of trends and intensity in relation to tropical cyclones: “The work all points in the same direction – the proportion of the most intense cyclones is going up.” He said: “There is nobody saying the trend will go the other way. The physics has been well set out for 30 or 40 years. If you get a warmer ocean then the intensities of cyclones goes up. That’s a 5% or 10% increase in maximum winds for every 1C of warming in the ocean. The world is warming and its because we have put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. “For the Australian region – which is the eastern Indian and southern west Pacific – it means we now have the potential for there to be more intense tropical cyclones coming ashore and doing more damage. “The chances of us getting an intense cyclone have gone up already and they will go up in the future.” Holland said there was also evidence that the ocean region of Australia where intense cyclones could strike was also expanding. The observed movement was only about 150km, he said, but this would soon put Brisbane “in the cyclone zone”. Prof Steven Sherwood, of the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre, said the study was important “because it shows that the upward trends first reported about a decade ago in cyclone activity have been sustained, and have now gone on long enough that it is no longer possible for them to be a random natural variation.” He said the study found that averaged globally, 30% of cyclones in the 1980s were “major” compared with 40% of cyclones now. “There is of course nothing surprising about this — we’ve just reached the point of ‘non-deniability’,” he said. “The implication for Australia is that our risk exposure to strong cyclones will almost certainly continue to increase as long as global temperatures increase. “It also appears that storms are encroaching farther away from the equator, although this is harder to confirm observationally. If this is true, it means that the Queensland southern coast in particular may be at growing risk.”"
"**Lancashire's council leaders are to submit a bid to government to introduce ""targeted"" mass Covid-19 testing.**
The county is set to move into tier three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends on Wednesday.
However, the area's infection rates vary largely, with Pendle registering 306.1 cases per 100,000 people, while Lancaster recorded 115 per 100,000.
Public health director Dominic Harrison said there would be a sharper focus on testing in areas with high cases.
The government previously said mass rapid testing schemes, which will ask all residents with or without coronavirus symptoms to take a test, would be rolled out to 67 more areas in England.
The scheme was piloted in Liverpool, which is now set to drop down into tier two restrictions after Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised the city's ""remarkable"" fall in infection rates following its introduction.
Areas to the east of the county, including Pendle, Blackburn and Rossendale, reported infection rates of more than 280 per 100,000 in the latest government figures for 25 November, far above western areas, such as Lancaster, Wyre and West Lancashire, where rates fell below 130.
Council leaders had asked for the county to be split into two tiers, reflecting these different rates, but the idea was rejected.
Mr Harrison said the government would formally offer Lancashire ""a mass testing option"" on Wednesday, which he expected to be a reduced version of Liverpool's model.
He said he expected ""some Army support"" for any testing regime, adding the county would ""do something similar [to] but not the same as Liverpool"" and ""target some of our mass testing"" on groups ""where we know the infection rates are highest"" such as a ward within a local authority ""or a group like the homeless"".
He said any testing would ""go ahead across the whole of Lancashire, but it will be targeted on the highest risk areas"".

Share this...FacebookTwitterDesperately Searching For Climate Warming In China, Alaska And Canada
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In mid October 2013 a temperature reconstruction of the last 250 years based on tree rings from northeast China appeared in the journal of Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. Recorded were the values for the time period of May-June, i.e. late spring and early summer.
Northeast China cooler than 100 years ago
A Chinese team of scientists led by Yu Liu discovered that the temperatures in the pre-industrial time from 1745-1900 was rather stable. But since the beginning of the 20th century, the temperatures in the region of study began to cool. As a result today the region is about 1°C colder than it was 100 years ago.

Figure 1: Development of the May-June temperatures in Northeast China since 1745. A cooling trend began in 1900. Source: Liu et al. 2013.
Alaska has cooled over the last decade
Now let’s take a look at Alaska. How have temperatures there developed over the last years and decades? The Arctic is supposedly warming up faster and faster and we are all supposed to be in a state of alarm over this. But a look at the temperature curve of the last 60 years delivers a surprise (Figure 2). Already at the end of the 1970s temperatures were surging upwards and stayed at a high level until 2005. But since then the curve has fallen dramatically. Alaska has been only cooling for the last 8 years. The temperature development there is closely coupled to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

USA is not warming
Moreover some scientists are now wondering why many rivers on the US west coast have been cooling significantly over the last few years. What could the cause of this be, especially at a time when things are supposed to be getting warmer? Also the temperature development for the USA for the last 110 years is showing a puzzling trend: Somehow over the long-term it just hasn’t gotten warmer? Already back in the 1930s and 40s it was just as warm as it is today (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Temperature development of the der USA based on USHCN data.
Canadian British Columbia was warmer in the 1940s
Also some interesting findings about the temperature history in Canadian British Columbia have become known. Based on tree-rings, scientists have reconstructed the temperature development for the last 800 years for the summer months of June/July (Figure 4). Here it can be observed that the 1940s were warmer than today. Also in the earlier centuries there were phases when it was warmer than today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJosef Kowatsch of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has issued a press release informing that there’s been no increasing temperature in Germany in 17 years!

Even though CO2 concentrations are increasing, annual mean temperature in Germany is cooling. Originally a warming of 0.4°C per decade was announced. Instead a cooling of more than 0.2°C per decade has actually been observed! Chart by J. Kowatsch, data from the German Weather Service (DWD).
Especially in Germany over the last 20 years people have been told to fear ever more threatening dangers from increasing climate change. Self-proclaimed “climate experts” from reinsurers and high-paid climate scientists have been falling all over each other in delivering bad news year after year. Cities and communities are instructed to fight the already started and supposedly worsening climate warming, otherwise there’s the threat of a climate collapse showing up in the near future. “Fight climate change!“ is the motto that is now being used – as if the entire country were on a war footing. The enemy: man-made CO2.
But the reality is very different. Even though December 2013 has been mild, the annual temperature for 2013 is only 8.7°C , the second coldest in 17 years.  In nature, using temperature, the religiously repeated belief of a strongly warming greenhouse effect as a consequence of man-made CO2 is nowhere in sight.
The fact is: CO2 values are rising, but temperatures in Germany have been falling 16 years and the trend has been down for 17.

Small business owners aren't typically lawyers, though they are undoubtedly familiar with the thousands of inscrutable pages of new regulations published every year in the Federal Register. Instead of devoting their energies to growing their businesses, owners must expend significant time and resources ensuring compliance with these voluminous and often vague regulations, with costly fines looming as consequences for failure to comply. “The Fourth Branch & Underground Regulations,” a new report by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), details the processes by which administrative agencies skirt “notice-and-comment” requirements to impose new interpretations of rules that avoid the constitutional system of checks and balances. Unfortunately, operating on this shifting field disproportionately affects small businesses, as they are most poorly equipped to lobby for favorable rules.   
  
The Administrative Procedure Act established “notice-and-comment” as a means for regulated businesses to voice concerns with or offer suggestions to improve proposed regulations. However, “non-legislative rules,” or “general statements of policy” and “interpretive rules,” are not required to undergo this process. This grants administrative agencies – the “Fourth Branch” of government – significant leeway in how “legislative rules” are interpreted and implemented, essentially giving them law making power. The recent Supreme Court ruling in _Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association _allows agencies not only to interpret rules without undergoing “notice-and-comment,” but also the ability to change their interpretation at any point. (Cato filed an amicus brief in the case.)    
  
Without a required need for transparency, agencies are thus free to issue “underground regulations” that impose serious and sudden rules on regulated businesses. NFIB examines four ways in which these “underground rules” are established: executive orders, guidance documents, amicus filings, and enforcement actions. Recognizing the potential dangers of this “underground” system of lawmaking, NFIB argues that “the regulated public should have a right to voice concerns over any newly announced rules, policy, or administrative interpretation of law that may impose _affirmative regulatory burdens_ on individuals or businesses” and urges agencies to “allows some opportunity for notice-and-comment on all new rules imposing liabilities or other regulatory burdens – without regard to quantifiable compliance costs.”   
  
Freed from congressional oversight and the beneficiary of considerable judicial deference, administrative agencies can pursue ideological agendas without the general public even being aware regulations are being instituted. One way this is achieved is by filing an _amicus_ brief in a case between two private parties. An agency can offer the court its authoritative interpretation of a rule -- though given the ruling in _Perez_ , the agency can change that interpretation in a later brief in another case or court.



For example, NFIB’s report details the process by which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reclassified McDonalds as a joint-employer with it franchisees, upending the franchise model and thirty years of established rules. In a June 2014 _amicus_ brief, the NLRB announced it’s plans to reinterpret its “joint-employer” rule to “treat franchisors as joint-employers with franchisees, or other independent contracting firms, so long as they exert ‘significant control’ over the same employees.” The NLRB further announced that significant control could be shown “simply by demonstrating that a franchisor has significant control over every-day business operations, without regard to whether the franchisor has exercised any control over personnel decisions.” Under previous rules, influence over personnel decisions dictated whether franchisors were considered “joint-employers,” so given McDonalds franchisees had control over hiring and disciplinary practices, McDonalds was not considered a joint-employer.   
  
Following this amicus brief, the NLRB filed thirteen complaints – enforcement actions – against McDonalds, alleging misconduct on the part of some of it franchisees, presenting McDonalds with a choice: loosen quality control over its franchisees (and thus risk brand degradation) or radically alter its business model and become more involved in the personnel decisions of its franchisees. While McDonalds might not be the most sympathetic victim of underground rule making, the rule change also affects its franchisees, “threaten[ing] a successful collaborative business model that has enabled many entrepreneurs to launch their own business.”   
  
Readers of this blog will be familiar with ongoing litigation over the current administration’s use of executive actions to pursue its immigration policy and EPA rule-making to further its climate agenda -- let alone the ongoing dispute between the House of Representatives and the president over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- but NFIB’s report offers numerous examples of how “underground regulation” affects businesses of all sizes in ways that don't gain media attention.

"The European Parliament has voted in a draft law aimed at halving the use of plastic bags across the continent by 2017, and further reducing them by at least 80% by 2019. This positive move is aimed at curbing the use of very thin plastic bags of less than 50 microns (0.05mm), which most often end up as flyblown litter in trees or break apart to be eaten by wildlife. The suggested measures include levies on bags, taxes, and compulsory replacements with biodegradable alternatives. There have been some successes already, in Ireland and Denmark, for example. In research colleagues and I published in the Journal of Business Ethics, we found that individuals, government institutions, and large organisations all have a role to play in encouraging a change of behaviour towards ethical consumerism. This step forward by the European Parliament should encourage governments to act decisively and pass laws to accelerate the reduction in the use of wasteful and polluting plastic bags.  In February 2014, the UK government’s cross-party Environment Audit Committee made a call for all shops to be included in plans to introduce a 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England. A similar scheme will be introduced in Scotland this autumn. Evidence from Ireland, where a plastic bag tax (“plastax”) in 2002 led to a 94% drop in bag use within months and raised millions of euros in levies. In Wales, a similar levy cut the use of single use bags by up to 96%. Northern Ireland reported a slightly smaller but still significant reduction of around 80%. But a sustained change in behaviour towards the use of plastic bags will require clear and concise action and a joined-up approach to tackling the problem. We found that supermarkets clearly had a key role in reducing the use of single-use carrier bags – the sort targeted by the European Parliament. The majority of respondents in our survey said they began using reusable “bags for life” in around 2008, which coincided with the introduction of the voluntary agreement between the British Retail Consortium, leading supermarkets and governments to reduce single-use carrier bags. Since the voluntary agreement ended in 2009, there has been a slow but steady increase in their use. We also found that although 80% of respondents claim to own a bag for life, almost a third still regularly use free single-use plastic bags, which demonstrate that there is still a gap between attitudes and behaviour. Even though a vast majority of people say they own a bag for life, with a significant number claiming to do so for environmental reasons, many are still left lying around at home, forgotten and unused. More needs to be done to reduce the gap between people’s intentions and their actions. For example, initiatives such as supermarkets texting their customers to remind them to bring their own bags have proved to be very successful. According to WRAP, the proportion of single-use bags as a percentage of total bags issued has remained stable since 2006, with single-use bags accounting for 95% and reuseable bags for life 5%. A unified effort from the European Parliament, together with member-state governments and major retailers could have a significant impact on the number of single-use bags being used. Their recommendations to use a combination of taxes and levies, marketing restrictions and bans to curb their use will be a positive step forward."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn October 27, I wrote an article about the EU’s plan to ban “energy guzzling” vacuum cleaners, read here. This is all part of a plan by EU bureaucrats dubbed the European Ecodesign Directive, which aims to regulate consumers into radical energy efficiency and low carbon emission lives.
Because many of these eco-intrusion schemes originate in Europe, they DO serve as an indicator of what awaits the rest of the world should these EU control-freak bureaucrats get out of control. Anyone who thinks this is only for Europe is being terribly naïve.
America be warned. The great socialization and ecolization of the USA by Europe and UN is well underway. Many of the USA’s leading policymakers (most of them Democrats) are collaborating with the EU socialists on this.
Long list of products are targeted
Today the T-Online website here tells us much more about what the EU has in store to get its own wasteful citizens TO live more responsibly.
And already there’s been harsh reaction to the above EU Directive. For example, T-Online writes that some EU Parliamntarians are warning that the European Ecodesign Directive is “central planning“.

The T-Online article starts by describing the regulation for vacuum cleaners, but then explains what else is in store for consumers. The list is long. T-Online writes:
Currently EU bureaucrats and manufacturers are discussing requirements for energy-gobbling laptops, stove exhausts, and even wine cooling cabinets. Other products were also in discussion but after criticism they were not taken up.”
Senseless, very expensive for the consumers
Water taps were among those that the EU (at least for now) has decided not to regulate. T-Online writes:
Especially the Verband kommunaler Unternehmen – Association of Municipal Companies (VKU) – were against Brussels’ plans to approve only energy-saving shower heads and water taps. Already today German appliances are consuming 20% less water and energy than in 1990. Soon municipalities will have to additionally flush their water lines and sewage canals in order to prevent them from caking up. The EU is ‘not only senseless, but also very expensive for the consumers,’ said VKU director Hans-Joachim Reck.”

"Animal populations have declined on average by 60% since 1970, and it’s predicted that around a million species are at risk of extinction. As more of the Earth’s biodiversity disappears and the human population grows, protected landscapes that are set aside to conserve biodiversity are increasingly important. Sadly, many are underfunded – some of Africa’s most treasured wildlife reserves operate in funding deficits of hundreds of millions of dollars. In unfenced wilderness, scientists rarely have an inventory on the exact numbers of species in an area at a particular time. Instead they make inferences using one of many different survey approaches, including camera traps, track surveys, and drones. These methods can estimate how much and what kind of wildlife is present, but often require large amounts of effort, time and money. Camera traps are placed in remote locations and activated by movement. They can collect vast quantities of data by taking photographs and videos of passing animals. But this can cost tens of thousands of dollars to run and once in the wild, cameras are at the mercy of curious wildlife.  Track surveys rely on specialist trackers, who aren’t always available and drones, while promising, have restricted access to many tourism areas in Africa. All of this makes wildlife monitoring difficult to carry out and repeat over large areas. Without knowing what’s out there, making conservation decisions based on evidence becomes almost impossible.   Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world – 42m people visited sub-Saharan Africa in 2018 alone. Many come for the unique wildlife and unknowingly collect valuable conservation data with their phones and cameras. Photographs on social media are already being used to help track the illegal wildlife trade and how often areas of wilderness are visited by tourists. Despite this, tourists and their guides are still an overlooked source of information. Could your holidays snaps help monitor endangered wildlife? In a recent study, we tested exactly this.  Partnering with a tour operator in Botswana, we approached all guests passing through a safari lodge over three months in the Okavango Delta and asked them if they were interested in contributing their photographs to help with conservation. We provided those interested with a small GPS logger – the type commonly used for tracking pet cats – so that we could see where the images were being taken.  We then collected, processed, and passed the images through computer models to estimate the densities of five large African carnivore species – lions, spotted hyaenas, leopards, African wild dogs and cheetahs. We compared these densities to those from three of the most popular carnivore survey approaches in Africa – camera trapping, track surveys, and call-in stations, which play sounds through a loudspeaker to attract wildlife so they can be counted. The tourist photographs provided similar estimates to the other approaches and were, in total, cheaper to collect and process. Relying on tourists to help survey wildlife saved up to US$840 per survey season. Even better, it was the only method to detect cheetahs in the area – though so few were sighted that their total density couldn’t be confirmed. Thousands of wildlife photographs are taken every day, and the study showed that we can use statistical models to cut through the noise and get valuable data for conservation. Still, relying on researchers to visit tourist groups and coordinate their photograph collection would be difficult to replicate across many areas. Luckily, that’s where wildlife tour operators could come in. Tour operators could help collect tourist images to share with researchers. If the efforts of tourists were paired with AI that could process millions of images quickly, conservationists could have a simple and low-cost method for monitoring wildlife. Tourist photographs are best suited for monitoring large species that live in areas often visited by tourists – species that tend to have high economic and ecological value. While this method perhaps isn’t as well suited to smaller species, it can still indirectly support their conservation by helping protect the landscapes they live in.   The line between true wilderness and landscapes modified by humans is becoming increasingly blurred, and more people are visiting wildlife in their natural habitats. This isn’t always a good thing, but maybe conservationists can use these travels to their advantage and help conserve some of the most iconic species on our planet."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany climate science used to be considered completely settled.
Global temperatures had been pretty much steady for a thousand years before skyrocketing upwards as soon as man really started industrializing about 150 years ago, Germans were told again and again.
But today Germany’s major media are beginning to realize that this view is perhaps quite naïve after all. Though most major media outlets here do think man is responsible for global warming, many seem to be having second thoughts and coming out to say: Gee, looks like natural factors may be important after all.

Germany’s version of the BBC is ARD television and at the ARD website we find an unusually semi-sober report on the history of the earth’s climate.
First off the ARD presents its version of the above chart, thus acknowledging that climate has been changing naturally throughout the Holocene and that there have been warmer periods than today.
Old towns bear names related to wine-making

The ARD piece even goes on to say that the Medieval Warm Period from the years 800 to 1300 was similarly as warm as the “last climate normal period of 1961 to 1990, whose mean temperature is used as the reference value.” The ARD writes further:
 Using alternative reconstructions that period was even about 0.5°C warmer than today.”
As evidence that this was probably the case, the ARD writes that many towns and villages that were founded during the Medieval Warm Period actually bear names related to wine-making: “places that are too cool for this today“.
The ARD then describes the ensuing Little Ice Age as a time of harsh winters, crop failures, starvation and witch hunts. All this, the ARD claims, was caused by “fluctuations in solar radiation and a series of especially powerful volcanic eruptions,” citing Tambora in 1815 as an example.
Of course anyone with a half knowledge of climate science knows that solar radiation is not the real culprit for climate change over the last 1000 years, but some other solar mechanism involving solar magnetic fields, cosmic radiation and cloud seeding. We’re just going to remain patient and wait for the ARD to get up to speed on this. In the meantime we can take heart that progress is being made.
Finally, I find that little tail they’ve added to the Modern Warm Period on their chart to be very amusing (see figure below, circle). That’s the warming all the panic and hysteria has been about?

 Circle around little tail indicates recent warming that has caused worldwide panic and mass hysteria.

"**Drinkers in tier two areas of England could order a Scotch egg with their pint to keep in line with post-lockdown rules, a cabinet minister has said.**
Under new restrictions from Wednesday, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant.
And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"".
Environment Secretary George Eustice told LBC Radio that Scotch eggs would constitute such a meal ""if there were table service"".
Downing Street has not ruled out tier two drinkers being able to order a Scotch egg, but would not set out the difference between a snack and a meal.
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""I'm obviously not going to get into the detail of every possible meal.
""But we've been clear: bar snacks do not count as a substantial meal but it's well established practice in the hospitality industry what does.""
Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways.
Mr Eustice said the ""substantial meal"" provision in tier two was ""understood very much by the restaurant trade"".
He said: ""I think a Scotch egg probably would count as a substantial meal if there were table service.
""Often that might be as a starter but yes I think it would, but this is a term that's understood in licensing... you can have the concept of a table licence for alcohol that also requires you to serve a substantial meal.
""That is the model that is being followed.""
When England's current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live.
In **tier one** , medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six.
In **tier two** regions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier.
You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to.
In **tier three** , very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services.
Most of England is in tier two or three, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one.
Mr Eustice added that there had been issues with pubs ""where you had large groups of people congregating and actually not maintaining social distancing, they were just drinking"".
""They were more likely to maintain social distancing sat down and having a meal,"" he said.
On Sky News, Mr Eustice was asked whether people in tier two would have to leave the pub as soon as they had finished their meals.
The environment secretary said people could finish their drinks, but should not have a ""small meal and then sit at the table all night ordering drinks"".
It comes after Downing Street suggested drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions would have to leave once they had finished their meal.
The government's latest guidance for hospitality in tier two states: ""Venues must close unless they operate as if they were a restaurant.
""This means serving substantial meals, like a main lunchtime or evening meal. They may only serve alcohol as part of such a meal.""
Meanwhile, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be forced to close at 18:00 GMT, under new rules to tackle a surge in coronavirus cases.
The concept of a ""substantial meal"" is not actually a new one in pubs, bars and restaurants.
It's an extension of the law that covers 16 and 17 year olds drinking alcohol in pubs with table meals.
In October, under England's previous three-tiered system, there was confusion over the definition of a ""substantial meal"".
Under those restrictions, it was only pubs and bars in tier three areas that faced extra curbs - and were forced to close unless they were serving substantial meals.
Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick responded by saying that a ""plated meal"" of a Cornish pasty with chips or a side salad would count as a ""normal meal""."

There is a fantastic post over at [Wattsupwiththat](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/09/07/propagation-of-error-and-the-reliability-of-global-air-temperature-projections-mark-ii/) that is well worth the read. It is quite long but utterly destroys the whole AGW, climate emergency, IPCC etc scam.



A few highlights:



The unavoidable conclusion is that whatever impact CO2 emissions may have on the climate **cannot have been detected in the past and cannot be detected now.**



Every single model air temperature projection since 1988 (and before) is physically meaningless. Every single detection-and-attribution study since then is physically meaningless. **When it comes to CO2 emissions and climate, no one knows what they’ve been talking about** : not the IPCC, not Al Gore (we knew that), not even the most prominent of climate modelers, and certainly no political poser.



 **There is no valid physical theory of climate able to predict what CO2 emissions will do to the climate, if anything. That theory does not yet exist.**



The Stefan-Boltzmann equation is not a valid theory of climate, although people who should know better evidently think otherwise including the NAS and every US scientific society. Their behavior in this is the most amazing abandonment of critical thinking in the history of science.



Absent any physically valid causal deduction, and noting that the climate has multiple rapid response channels to changes in energy flux, and noting further that the climate is exhibiting nothing untoward, one is left with no bearing at all on how much warming, if any, additional CO2 has produced or will produce.



From the perspective of physical science, it is very reasonable to conclude that **any effect of CO 2 emissions is beyond present resolution, and even reasonable to suppose that any possible effect may be so small as to be undetectable within natural variation.** Nothing among the present climate observables is in any way unusual.



The analysis upsets the entire IPCC applecart. It eviscerates the EPA’s endangerment finding, and removes climate alarm from the US 2020 election. **There is no evidence whatever that CO 2 emissions have increased, are increasing, will increase, or even can increase, global average surface air temperature.**



The analysis is straight-forward. It could have been done, and should have been done, 30 years ago. But was not.

In spite of the hours of research that has gone into this work, there is one major puzzle left for him:



Who’s going to tell the so cynically abused Greta? My imagination shies away from that picture.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Bild daily here reports on how a Chinese ice breaker trying to reach the sea ice-trapped Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel was stopped by thick sea ice:  “Also The Ice Breaker Gets Stuck!”
The 74 passengers who have now been trapped 4 days in unexpected Antarctic sea ice are made up of scientists, tourists, and crew members. One passenger onboard is a journalist from the UK’s global warming alarmist daily, The Guardian. Some have criticized the expedition as a global-warming publicity junket.
Bild reports that the vessel was on a 5-week expedition to repeat the route of Antarctic scientist Douglas Mawson of 100 years earlier. Ironically, rather than finding warming and open seas, the current expedition has wound up getting trapped by thick sea ice and blizzards that have yet to be penetrated even by modern ice breakers.
Bild writes that the Akademik Shokalskiy got trapped in ice on Christmas Eve and was forced to send out distress signals. Bild adds:
A Chinese ice breaker on its way to the MV Akademik Schokalskiy” had to bail out, it was unable to continue because of the pack ice!” 
According to Bild, the Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel had been only a couple of kilometers away from open water before it got stuck. Now even ice breakers cannot get within 6 miles of the vessel.
The Chinese ice breaker came as close as six and half nautical miles of the research vessel, but because of the thick ice it was unable to travel further.”

According to reports, Australian ice breaker Aurora Australis has the best chances of freeing the trapped research vessel, but that the ice breaker “will not arrive the sea ice until before Sunday.” That means the trapped passengers will have to sit tight for at least another day or two.
Frustration taking over
Originally it looked as if the Chinese ice breaker was about to reach the trapped boatpeople. Passenger and spokesman Chris Turney said that the ice breaker would arrive in “2 or 3 hours…if everything goes well”. But that turned out to be wishful thinking. The Chinese ice breaker was stopped by thick sea ice. Disappointment. Bild quotes Turney:
“The bad news is that the ice around our ship now extends out over 20 kilometers.”
Also the once festive atmosphere on the boat appears to be waning with frustration starting to creep in. Bild adds:
Even with Turney insisting that all is fine with the passengers and crew, a bit of frustration can be detected between his lines.”
The trapped boatpeople better start hoping for a little luck. Conditions down there are unpredictable and can get nasty really quickly. One bad storm could spell serious delays and lots of trouble. Moreover, expect the costs of the rescue efforts to run up into the millions.

Photo right: German Environment Agency defamatory pamphlet
When a large government agency like the UBA uses its massive resources to single out, villify and literally spread lies about private individuals in attempt to marginalize and injure their repuation, solely because they have a different opinion on an issue, then it has to be taken as a very troubling development. When was this last used in Germany, we have to ask.
The list is not complete, and links of course can be added. Sorry, most are in German. But the NoTricksZone articles are in English and talk about the German articles.
The latest real development occurred on May 27, with the German Journalists Association publicly demanding that the UBA recall it’s pamphlet and that Minister Peter Altmaier officialy apologize to the German journalists named in the pamphlet.

"The list of the natural world’s most extraordinary places, UNESCO’s World Heritage List, gained its 1,000th entry this week with the addition of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. To be chosen for the UNESCO list a site must be deemed to have  “outstanding universal value”.  It is fitting that the delta should be such a landmark choice as it is quite simply unique: a wetland located in a desert, a delta that does not flow into the sea. This may sound improbable, but actually it provides an exceptional example of how biological, hydrological, biogeochemical and climatic processes have interacted to give us an ecosystem of outstanding importance and amazing biological diversity. The Okavango Delta is unusual in many respects. In October every year, rain falling in the highlands of Angola flows down the Cubango and Cuito rivers that, at the border between Angola and Namibia, join to form the Okavango River. This pulse of water, which accounts for over 60% of water entering the delta, flows slowly downstream over the course of four to seven months, reaching the northern part of the delta between February and May.  The pulse of water enters the delta through a broad valley in northern Botswana called the panhandle. Here the water is relatively deep and fast-flowing, cutting through the Kalahari sands, before a perpendicular geological fault caused by tectonic activity causes the water to spread slowly out into a fan, reaching the southern regions of the delta by August-September. In the southern hemisphere these are winter months, and in this particular region it is also the dry season. Therefore, the maximum flood extent actually occurs at the driest point of the year. This pulse of water causes the size of the delta to fluctuate dramatically, approximately doubling its size from 6,000km2 to 12,000km2 every year during the dry season. Local rainfall during the summer months accounts for less than 40% of the delta’s river flow, but still plays an important role in influencing the extent of the area that’s flooded by the delta. Together they ensure local wildlife have water with which to thrive for much of the year, turning the delta into a huge green oasis that provides habitats on land and water for abundant plants and animals. Another remarkable feature of the delta is that, in the blazing heat of the desert, 98% of its water is lost through evaporation and transpiration (water taken up through plants and evaporating from their leaves). This is another paradox of the delta, that its waters remain fresh and not saline even with a strong sub-tropical sun. This is due to a complex set of interactions, only recently understood, which involve termites, trees and over 150,000 islands. Most islands in the delta are thought to originate from tree saplings growing on termite mounds. As the trees grow, water and solutes are drawn up from the ground into plants and released through transpiration. This causes the water table to drop over time, which draws in water from the surrounding floodplains to replace it, and so keeps the area replenished with fresh water.  Salts concentrate under the islands creating zones of hyper-saline soils in which few organisms can survive, but as the concentrations of salts under the islands increases, the salts become sufficiently dense and heavy that they sink to the bottom, effectively ensuring a layer of fresh water above.   The Okavango Delta is one of Africa’s few remaining pristine wetlands, and since 1997 it has been classified as the world’s largest Wetland of International Importance. It has seen little damage from human activity, partly due to its nutrient-poor waters that result in low fish yields, and partly from a tourism policy that generates considerable income with minimal impact.  However, these long periods of available water and the delta’s nutrient-rich grasslands and floodplains have given rise to blossoming life, one Africa’s greatest concentrations of wildlife: the world’s largest population of elephants, hippos, and many threatened species such as the wild dog, black and white rhinos, and cheetahs. A great number of the 450 species of birds recorded on the delta are also globally threatened, such as slaty egrets and wattled cranes. This diversity is no accident; it is closely linked to the exceptional diversity of habitats caused by the unique dynamics of the pulse of floodwaters during the driest season.  Natural rainfall variation and the region’s internal hydrology mean there is always variation in the size and extent of the floodwaters. For example, after a period of contraction in the late 1990s-2000s the last few years have seen the delta flood to an extent not seen since the 1960s. It is perhaps inevitable that a warmer world will affect the region, and although the effects are not well understood, preliminary results suggest that floodwaters will decline.  But another clear and present danger, and one whose effects might be felt much sooner, is the threat posed to water and wildlife by the Botswanan government’s granting of 41 mineral licenses for diamonds, base metals, and oil in the Okavango Delta earlier this year. Even on the UNESCO list, nothing can be taken for granted."

Dr Nir J. Shaviv is a well-known astrophysicist with over [100 scientific papers to his credit](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~shaviv/cv/cv.html#refer) and he is currently chairman of the Racah Institute of Physics at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 



I think it’s safe to say that Dr. Shaviv knows a thing or two about science and how it is done. One of his specialties is studying [the effect that cosmic rays have on the earth’s climate](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~shaviv/Ice-ages/GSAToday.pdf). So just to make it clear. Dr. Nir Shaviv is a **well-respected scientist** who has published peer-reviewed research specifically about earth’s climate.[…]



[…] while I certainly don’t have to agree with the conclusions of any given expert, I do have to at least try to understand the data the expert has collected and why he or she thinks they point to a certain conclusion. If I don’t do that, I am no longer thinking scientifically. After all, the only way you can make a scientific conclusion is to **consider** _ **all of the data**_ **.** Ignoring data because I don’t agree with the source is not scientific; it is emotional.



Why am I bringing this up? Because last night, I was scrolling through a news feed and noticed a _Forbes_ article entitled, “Global Warming? An Israeli Astrophysicist Provides Alternative View That Is Not Easy To Reject.” Obviously, that title was very interesting to me, so I clicked on [the link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doronlevin/2019/08/09/global-warming-an-israeli-astrophysicist-provides-alternative-view-that-is-not-easy-to-reject). Unfortunately, what I found was a message that said:



 _After review, this post has been removed for failing to meet our editorial standards._



 _We are providing our readers the headline, author and first paragraphs in the interest of transparency._



 _We regret any inconvenience._



This seemed rather odd to me, so I decided to do some digging. What I found did not reflect well on _Forbes_.



As Erica Albright [says](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/effd5b2f-cb9d-4fe0-8aed-2b331dbd8afa) in _The Social Network_ :



 _The internet is not written in pencil, Mark. It’s written in ink._



Knowing this, I went searching for the article that _Forbes_ claims does not meet its editorial standards. I used my favorite tool for this purpose (mostly because of the name), [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190809111919/https://www.forbes.com/sites/doronlevin/2019/08/09/global-warming-an-israeli-astrophysicist-provides-alternative-view-that-is-not-easy-to-reject/). I found the article and read it in its entirety. What I found was an excellent article that clearly explains one respected scientist’s view of the global warming hysteria that certain high-profile scientists and politicians are promoting. Since then, [it has been posted elsewhere](https://learn-about-global-warming.blogspot.com/2019/08/global-warming-israeli-astrophysicist_9.html), in a form that is probably easier for most browsers to read.



Please read the article for yourself. While reading, try to spot what caused _Forbes_ to decide that it didn’t meet their editorial standards.[…]



[…] As far as I can tell, _Forbes_ decided the article didn’t meet its “editorial standards” because it failed to support that narrative.

In groupthink, organizations value consensus more than free thought. The emphasis on consensus leads to group polarization, in which a group’s positions become more extreme than any individual would come up with. Alarmist climate science is a textbook example of groupthink in action.
Guest post by Paul MacRae
A while ago, I received an email from a friend who asked:
How can many, many respected, competitive, independent science folks be so wrong about [global warming] (if your [skeptical] premise is correct). I don’t think it could be a conspiracy, or incompetence. …  Has there ever been another case when so many ‘leading’ scientific minds got it so wrong?
The answer to the second part of my friend’s question—“Has there ever been another case where so many ‘leading’ scientific minds got it so wrong?”—is easy. Yes, there are many such cases, both within and outside climate science. In fact, the graveyard of science is littered with the bones of theories that were once thought “certain” (e.g., that the continents can’t “drift,” that Newton’s laws were immutable, and hundreds if not thousands of others).
Science progresses by the overturning of theories once thought “certain.”
And so, Carl Sagan has written:
“Even a succession of professional scientists—including famous astronomers who had made other discoveries that are confirmed and now justly celebrated—can make serious, even profound errors in pattern recognition.”[1]
There is no reason to believe that climate scientists (alarmist or skeptic) are exempt from this possibility.

That leaves the first question, which is how so many “respected, competitive, independent science folks [could] be so wrong” about the causes and dangers of global warming, assuming they are wrong. And here, I confess that after five years of research into climate fears, this question still baffles me.
Climate certainty is baffling
It is not baffling that so many scientists believe humanity might be to blame for global warming. If carbon dioxide causes warming, additional CO2 should produce additional warming. But it’s baffling that alarmist climate scientists are so certain that additional carbon dioxide will produce a climate disaster, even though there is little empirical evidence to support this view, and much evidence against it, including a decade of non-warming. This dogmatism makes it clear, at least to those outside the alarmist climate paradigm, that something is very wrong with the state of “consensus” climate science.
There are many possible reasons for this scientific blindness, including sheer financial and career self-interest: scientists who don’t accept the alarmist paradigm will lose research grants and career doors will be closed to them. But one psychological diagnosis fits alarmist climate science like a glove: groupthink. With groupthink, we get the best explanation of “how can many, many respected, competitive, independent science folks be so wrong.”
Groupthink was extensively studied by Yale psychologist Irving L. Janis and described in his 1982 book Groupthink: Psychological Studies of Policy Decisions and Fiascoes.
Janis was curious about how teams of highly intelligent and motivated people—the “best and the brightest” as David Halberstam called them in his 1972 book of the same name—could have come up with political policy disasters like the Vietnam War, Watergate, Pearl Harbor and the Bay of Pigs. Similarly, in 2008 and 2009, we saw the best and brightest in the world’s financial sphere crash thanks to some incredibly stupid decisions, such as allowing sub-prime mortgages to people on the verge of bankruptcy.
In other words, Janis studied why and how groups of highly intelligent professional bureaucrats and, yes, even scientists, screw up, sometimes disastrously and almost always unnecessarily. The reason, Janis believed, was “groupthink.” He quotes Nietzsche’s observation that “madness is the exception in individuals but the rule in groups,” and notes that groupthink occurs when “subtle constraints … prevent a [group] member from fully exercising his critical powers and from openly expressing doubts when most others in the group appear to have reached a consensus.”[2]
Janis found that even if the group leader expresses an openness to new ideas, group members value consensus more than critical thinking; groups are thus led astray by excessive “concurrence-seeking behavior.”[3] Therefore, Janis wrote, groupthink is “a model of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members’ strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.”[4]
The groupthink syndrome
The result is what Janis calls “the groupthink syndrome.” This consists of three main categories of symptoms:
1. Overestimate of the group’s power and morality, including “an unquestioned belief in the group’s inherent morality, inclining the members to ignore the ethical or moral consequences of their actions.” [emphasis added]
2. Closed-mindedness, including a refusal to consider alternative explanations and stereotyped negative views of those who aren’t part of the group’s consensus. The group takes on a “win-lose fighting stance” toward alternative views.[5]
3. Pressure toward uniformity, including “a shared illusion of unanimity concerning judgments conforming to the majority view”; “direct pressure on any member who expresses strong arguments against any of the group’s stereotypes”; and “the emergence of self-appointed mind-guards … who protect the group from adverse information that might shatter their shared complacency about the effectiveness and morality of their decisions.”[6]
It’s obvious that alarmist climate science—as explicitly and extensively revealed in the Climatic Research Unit’s “Climategate” emails—shares all of these defects of groupthink, including a huge emphasis on maintaining consensus, a sense that because they are saving the world, alarmist climate scientists are beyond the normal moral constraints of scientific honesty (“overestimation of the group’s power and morality”), and vilification of those (“deniers”) who don’t share the consensus.
For example, regarding Symptom 1, overestimation of the group’s power and morality: leading consensus climate spokespeople like Al Gore, James Hansen, and Stephen Schneider have stated outright that they feel it’s acceptable and even moral to exaggerate global-warming claims to gain public support, even if they have to violate the broader scientific principle of adherence to truth at all costs (http://www.paulmacrae.com/?p=51 has examples.) Consensus climate science also overestimates the power of humanity to override climate change, whether human-caused or natural, just as government planners overestimated the U.S.’s ability to win the Vietnam War.
Regarding Symptom 2, closed-mindedness, there are many cases of the alarmist climate paradigm ignoring or suppressing evidence that challenges the AGW hypothesis. The Climategate emails, for example, discuss refusing publication to known skeptics and even firing an editor favorable to skeptics.
Regarding Symptom 3, pressure toward uniformity: within alarmist climate science there is a “shared illusion of unanimity” (i.e., a belief in total consensus) about the majority view when this total or near-total consensus has no basis in reality. For example, the Oregon Petition against the anthropogenic warming theory has 31,000 signatories, over 9,000 of them with PhDs.
Climate scientists who dare to deviate from the consensus are censured as “deniers”—a choice of terminology that can only be described as odious. And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change explicitly aims for “consensus” in its reports—it does not publish minority reports, and yet it is impossible that its alleged more than “2,000 scientists” could completely agree on a subject as complicated as climate.
Group polarization
Janis notes one other form of dysfunctional group dynamic that arises out of groupthink and that, in turn, helps create even more groupthink:
The tendency for the collective judgments arising out of group discussions to become polarized, sometimes shifting toward extreme conservatism and sometimes toward riskier forms of action than the individual members would otherwise be prepared to take.[7]
This dynamic is commonly referred to as “group polarization.”
As a process, “when like-minded people find themselves speaking only with one another, they get into a cycle of ideological reinforcement where they end up endorsing positions far more extreme than the ones they started with.”[8] [emphasis added]
And because these positions are so extreme, they are held with extreme ferocity against all criticisms.
Examples of alarmist climate groupthink
Groupthink is common in academic disciplines. For example, philosopher Walter Kaufmann, a world-renowned editor of Nietzsche’s works, identifies groupthink in his discipline as follows:
There is a deep reluctance to stick out one’s neck: there is safety in numbers, in belonging to a group, in employing a common method, and in not developing a position of one’s own that would bring one into open conflict with more people than would be likely to be pleased.[9]
Similarly, in the 2009 Climategate emails, CRU director Phil Jones shows this “deep reluctance to stick out one’s neck” in writing (July 5, 2005):
“The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998.”
Keith Briffa laments (Sept. 22, 1999):
“I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the temperature proxy data’ but in reality the situation is not quite so simple. … I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago.”
Elsewhere, Briffa notes (April 29, 2007):
“I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC, which were not always the same. I worried that you might think I gave the impression of not supporting you well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties.”
All of the above (there are many more examples in the Climategate emails) reveal scientific groupthink, which puts the needs and desires of a peer group—the desire for “consensus”—ahead of the scientific facts. We would, undoubtedly, find other examples of alarmist groupthink if we could examine the emails of other promoters of climate alarmism, like James Hansen’s Goddard Institute.
This groupthink isn’t at all surprising. After all, alarmist climate scientists attend several conferences a year with like-minded people (the views of outright “deniers” are not welcome, as the CRU emails clearly reveal). In the absence of real debate or dissent they easily persuade themselves that human beings are the main reason the planet is warming and it’s going to be a catastrophe. Why? Because everyone else seems to think so and, in groupthink, consensus is highly valued. The same principles operates strongly, of course, in religion.
The ‘hockey stick’ and groupthink
Climate alarmists will, of course, angrily dispute that climate science groupthink is as strong as claimed here. However, groupthink is clearly identified in the 2006 Wegman report into the Michael Mann hockey stick controversy.
As most WUWT readers will know, the Wegman report was commissioned by the U.S. House Science Committee after Mann refused to release all the data leading to the hockey stick conclusions, conclusions that eliminated the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age in order to show today’s warming as unprecedented. In fact, as mathematician Steve McIntyre discovered after years of FOI requests, the calculations in Mann’s paper had not been checked by the paper’s peer reviewers and were, in fact, wrong.
The National Academy of Sciences committee, led by Dr. Edward Wegman, an expert on statistics, identified one of the reasons why Mann’s paper was so sloppily peer-reviewed as follows:
There is a tightly knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis. However, our perception is that this group has a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism and, moreover, the work has been sufficiently politicized that they can hardly reassess their public positions without losing credibility.[10] [emphasis added]
Wegman noted that the Mann paper became prominent because it “fit some policy agendas.”[11]
The Wegman Report also observed:
As statisticians, we were struck by the isolation of communities such as the paleoclimate community that rely heavily on statistical methods, yet do not seem to be interacting with the mainstream statistical community. The public policy implications of this debate are financially staggering and yet apparently no independent statistical expertise was sought or used.[12] [emphasis added]
In other words, alarmist climate scientists are part of an exclusive group that talks mainly with itself and avoids groups that don’t share the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis and alarmist political agenda. Overall, Wegman is describing with great precision a science community whose conclusions have been distorted and polarized by groupthink.
Recognizing groupthink
After the Climategate emails, some consensus climate scientists began to recognize the dangers of groupthink within their discipline. So, Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry wrote in 2009:
In my opinion, there are two broader issues raised by these emails that are impeding the public credibility of climate research: lack of transparency in climate data, and “tribalism” in some segments of the climate research community that is impeding peer review and the assessment process.[13]
Similarly, IPCC contributor Mike Hulme wrote:
It is possible that climate science has become too partisan, too centralized. The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with social organization within primitive cultures; it is not attractive when we find it at work inside science.[14] [emphasis added]
In short, it is clear that groupthink—a later, more scientific word for “tribalism”—is strongly at work within alarmist climate science, however much the affected scientists refuse to recognize it. As a result of tribalism (groupthink), alarmist climate science makes assertions that are often extreme (polarized), including the explicit or implicit endorsement of claims that global warming will lead to “oblivion,” “thermageddon,” mass extinctions, and the like. Indeed, one of the ironies of climate science is that extremist AGW believers like Gore, Hansen and Schneider have succeeded in persuading the media and public that those who don’t make grandiose claims, the skeptics, are the extremists.
Group polarization offers a rational explanation for extreme alarmist claims, given that the empirical scientific evidence is simply not strong enough to merit such confidence. It is likely that even intelligent, highly educated scientists have been caught in what has been called the “madness of crowds.” Indeed, writing in the Times Higher Education magazine, British philosopher Martin Cohen makes this connection explicit:
Is belief in global-warming science another example of the “madness of crowds”? That strange but powerful social phenomenon, first described by Charles Mackay in 1841, turns a widely shared prejudice into an irresistible “authority”. Could it [belief in human-caused, catastrophic global warming] indeed represent the final triumph of irrationality?[16]
There is strong psychological evidence that alarmist fears of climate change are far more the result of groupthink and the group polarization process than scientific evidence and, yes, this alarmist groupthink has indeed led to the triumph of irrationality over reason.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe outrage over a defamatory pamphlet published by Germany’s version of the EPA, the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), has been spreading. The UBA is headed by Jochen Flasbarth, a former environmental activist with strong ties to Germany’s radical green party. It is a department within the German Ministry of Environment.
 
Merkel’s Environment Minister Peter Altmaier defends pamphlet which he admits he has not even read yet. Photo credit: Rudolf Simon, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
The brochure singles out and defames US and German climate science skeptic scientists and journalists, claiming they are spreading false information and half truths.
Moreover, the pamphlet claims that the skeptic scientists are not real climate scientists and are thus disqualified to make assessments on climate science. Thus they are best ignored.
End of career.
But now the scandal and outrage have reached the attention of Flasbarth’s boss, Angela Merkel’s Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, so reports the online Die Welt here. Altmaier has commented on the scandal for the first time. Tomorrow Die Welt Sunday print edition will feature of full interview with Minister Altmaier on the topic.

Today the online Die Welt here offers a preview. If the preview is anything to go by, then we can assume that the German government so far thinks it’s okay for them to issue a pamphlet that defame anyone they do not like. That would be a very nasty development. Die Welt writes:
Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) has defended a controversial brochure on climate change from the Federal Environment Agency (UBA). ‘What’s decisive for me is whether legal errors have been made and whether the political position of the Federal Government is correctly reflected,’ Altmaier said. “
At that point we need to recall that Altmaier is a very polished lawyer. I’m not sure what he means to say here. Does he mean to say that it is the position of the German government to defame and ruin the reputation of people, so long it’s done legally? I really do hope that defaming individuals has not become the official position of the German government.
Altmaier also tells Die Welt that he did not personally approve the pamphlet and that he relies on the competence of Flasbarth and his staff. But that is precisely the problem. The UBA has gotten so activist and ideological that you cannot rely on them doing the right and fair thing. It’s renegade and it is now time for Altmaier to get that house back in order. The pamphlet confirms that.
In the Die Welt online article it becomes clear that Minister Altmaier has not even read the pamphlet up to now, and thus is not aware of its dubious and highly confrontational content. Welt writes:
The editor in chief of the ‘Welt’ Group, Jan-Eric Peters, then asked Altmaier via Twitter: ‘Is this the new style of your press work?’ Altmaier answers, so far I’m only aware of ‘snips of text’ and requested: ‘Please send me a copy and I’ll check it over.'”
We can only speculate what is going to happen next. What should happen is: “Altmaier will read the pamphlet published by his underling Flasbarth at the UBA, be shocked, and then move to clean up the renegade UBA house. But we live in a political world, and so things will likely processed as follows instead: Altmaier will read the pamphlet published by his underling Flasbarth at the UBA, be shocked, but insist nothing wrong was done – and then promote the responsible persons to higher positions, but out of the UBA.

Guest post by Indur M. Goklany 
Over at the Wall Street Journal a group of pedigreed individuals headed by Dr. Kevin Trenberth argue: 

Do you consult your dentist about your heart condition? In science, as in any area, reputations are based on knowledge and expertise in a field and on published, peer-reviewed work. If you need surgery, you want a highly experienced expert in the field who has done a large number of the proposed operations.

Wrong answer!! 
If you need surgery you DON’T want “a highly experienced expert in the field who has done a large number of the proposed operations.” What you want is “a highly experienced expert in the field who has CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT HIS OR HER OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL!”  
And if before I go to a dentist, I would like evidence that the dentist does not pull the wrong teeth (even on occasion).  
Unfortunately, there is no convincing evidence that climate models can successfully predict future climate — and I mean “climate” not just “temperature.” [The latter is just one aspect of the climate and for many impacts it may not even be the most relevant.] 

Climate models, which are the source of the apocalyptic vision of global warming, have not been validated using data that were not used in their development. Even the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the IPCC acknowledge as much. Specifically, the IPCC does not say that “all” features of current climate or past climate changes can be reproduced, as a reliable model of climate change ought to be able to do endogenously. In fact, it notes: 

“… models still show significant errors. Although these are generally greater at smaller scales, important large scale problems also remain. For example, deficiencies remain in the simulation of tropical precipitation, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (an observed variation in tropical winds and rainfall with a time scale of 30 to 90 days).” (AR4WG1, p. 601). 

And the CCSP has this to say in its 2008 publication, Climate Models: An Assessment of Strengths and Limitations. A Report by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research: 

“Climate model simulation of precipitation has improved over time but is still problematic. Correlation between models and observations is 50 to 60% for seasonal means on scales of a few hundred kilometers.” (CCSP 2008:3).  
“In summary, modern AOGCMs generally simulate continental and larger-scale mean surface temperature and precipitation with considerable accuracy, but the models often are not reliable for smaller regions, particularly for precipitation.” (CCSP 2008: 52). 

So before one pulls society’s economic teeth, validate the models or else you could end up pulling society’s economic teeth in error.  
In the medical profession this would be known as “evidence-based medicine.” Exactly the same principle should apply to climate change remedies. We should insist on nothing less.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
MPs are expected to give the go-ahead later to a stricter three-tier system of restrictions in England. Boris Johnson insists it's needed to keep infections under control, but a sizeable chunk of his own backbenchers are broadly against tighter controls. Labour won't endorse the new system, but won't reject it either. Sir Keir Starmer says he has ""serious misgivings"" and wants his MPs to abstain, but it isn't ""in the national interest"" to block it. The SNP will also abstain because the plans only apply to England. The upshot of all that is more than 55 million people are therefore set to enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday - a reminder of what that means.
England's chief inspector of schools says the ""invisibility of vulnerable children"" during the pandemic should be a ""matter of national concern"". In her annual report, Amanda Spielman warns long absences from school mean signs of abuse may have been missed and it should now be a priority to find overlooked cases. She also raises concerns about the pressures on families of children with special educational needs. It's the latest in a long line of warnings about the impact of coronavirus on already disadvantaged groups. BBC's special correspondent Ed Thomas witnesses the struggles first hand in one town.
More areas of Scotland are expected to move into a stricter tier of virus restrictions later. Public health officials recommended the move for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire following an increase in cases. Wales, too, will face fresh curbs from Friday. Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. We answer your questions on the latest Welsh picture here. And see the rules around eating or drinking out and about wherever you are in the UK.
Covid-19 could be causing lung abnormalities still detectable more than three months after people catch the disease. The damage emerged in scans of 10 patients at Oxford University and researchers now plan a larger study to find out more. The risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 increases markedly for the over 60s, but if the trial discovers that lung damage occurs across a wider age group - even in those not requiring hospital treatment - ""it would move the goalposts"", says Prof Fergus Gleeson, who is leading the work.
Christmas tree growers across the UK say they're having a bumper year \- potentially selling two million more specimens than normal. Pete Hyde, owner of Trinity Street Christmas Trees in Dorset. told the BBC his sales were up by nearly a third. It could be that some sales are coming earlier as people look to scratch a shopping itch while other stores are closed. Or it could be households are desperately looking for some festive cheer and an ""authentic"" Christmas experience after so much hardship this year.

Jacinda sees herself as a climate warrior. Let’s face it… climate change is her generation’s ‘nuclear moment’, even though she does not seem to understand that there have been no nuclear explosions (Thank God) since 1945, other than tests, and they have mostly been condemned. The North Koreans continue with tests from time to time, but they are simply trying to send a message to the world that they might be able to… not that anyone, other than the poor unfortunates who live in Seoul, are particularly worried.



The truth about Jacinda, however, is that she is all talk. This will not come as a surprise to most of you. After all, she has talked big about Kiwibuild, the homeless, mental health and cancer drugs but all of these problems just seem to get bigger and bigger under this government.



That is because all Jacinda seems to be able to do is to talk about problems, rather than provide solutions.



She’s good at it. Remember Kiwibuild. Remember mental health. Remember her speech last year about how _#metoo_ should become _#wetoo_ and she has an alleged rapist in her own office. None of the #metoo supporters has said a word because it is okay if the left does it.



All she has done at the Pacific Forum is talk. She has done nothing to make New Zealand lead the way on climate change, but boy, she has talked us up big time.



Don’t get me wrong. I think we are wrecking our economy enough with the Zero Carbon Bill, and the Greens’ proposals to take us back to the Stone Age. But Jacinda is well aware that she will lose the next election badly if she really hammers agriculture, so she has mostly left it out of our emissions reductions scheme.



Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, as Jacinda knows only too well. Coal is the backbone of Australia’s economy. But what has she done? She has called for the Australians to reduce their economic activity around coal.



Demanding Australia abandon its coal production and exports for the good of the climate in the ­Pacific is akin to asking New Zealan­d to give up its love affair with sheep.



New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is naive if she believe­s such moves would be economically feasible or in the best interests of regional stability.



But it has only been possible because less than 20 per cent of New Zealand’s electricity comes from fossil fuels and its biggest source of emissions, agriculture, has been given a free pass.  
Most New Zealand power comes from hydro, geothermal and, increasingly, wind.  
In terms of historic performance, New Zealand just scraped through the first Kyoto round of emissions cuts and failed to sign up to a legally binding target for the second. New Zealand parted company with Europe and Aust­ralia and instead joined Japan, Canada and Russia in a non-binding commitment for 2020. 



One thing I have learned from Jacinda is that she thinks it is okay to talk the talk but not to actually do anything. She knows perfectly well that agriculture is the backbone of our economy, and we are already having enough issues around that, with the fall of Fonterra in recent months. Also, we are showing some serious signs of an economic recession, and this government cannot pretend it has nothing to do with that although it will, of course.



For Jacinda to criticise Australia’s coal outputs while our biggest CO2 emissions come from agriculture is hypocrisy of the first order.



Australia’s ability to give huge swathes of money to the Pacific comes from their ability to export coal, among other things. Nobody seems to recognise that.



Neither Australia or New Zealand are exactly sinners on the global spectrum when it comes to CO2 emissions. Both countries pale into complete insignificance when it comes to China, who is also wooing the Pacific, with cheap loans and lots of cash.



This will end badly for the Pacific Islands, of course, who have dollar signs in their eyes, and cannot see that Australia is a much bigger friend to them than China will ever be.



In the meantime, the Pacific Island Forum has blamed Australia for their problems, which are mostly non-existent, and Jacinda, being a great neighbour, has put the ankle boot in at the same time.



I am truly ashamed of our pathetic _#parttimepm_.

This seems like an eco-dream come true, a car the runs on air developed in India. I’ve seen stories on this since 2008, but have yet to see the car hit market. Now the claim is in August 2012.
I don’t think you’ll see IPCC chairman Rajenda Pachauri driving one of these though, since he has been prone to booking posh 5 star hotel suites and won’t even drive the electric car he has. And like an electric car, that energy to charge the air tank with compressed air has to come from someplace, and that someplace if you are connected to the grid is likely fossil fuels, nuclear, or perhaps hydro. Though, with no fuel taxes, it might be a hit with anti-tax crusaders. With a claimed top speed of 60mph and range 185 miles, it should be enough to overcome the range anxiety of electric cars, and there’s no worry about battery fires or having to replace the expensive battery pack in 2-4 years. Whether it will ever be seen in the USA will of course depend on its crash worthiness. And when there is a crash, will it do this?
 Story submitted by George Lawson
What is this? ‘Alison Italo Aus’
Will it be the next big thing?
Tata Motors of India thinks so.
What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?
It is an auto engine that runs on air.  That’s right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around us.  Take a look.
Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012
The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to push its engine’s pistons and make the car go.
The Air Car, called the “Mini CAT” could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.  
The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air.  A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car.  One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car.  Which are not many.
The four cyclinder compressed air engine
The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.
There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket.  According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees per 100 KM, that’s about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas.  It’s mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists.  The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels.  Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors.  A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.
This car can also be filled at home with it’s on board compressor.  It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep.
Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles.  Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.
This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true.  We’ll see in August 2012 if it is.

Japan’s gigantic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and the associated tsunami are abject tragedies, responsible for the sudden death of probably 20,000 individuals. So why are we perseverating instead on the release of tiny amounts of radiation from the Fukushima Dai‐​Ichi nuclear power plant?



This is the familiar story of misplaced concern about tiny risks while blithely ignoring other major ones. People who have irrational fears of small amounts of ionizing radiation have no problem crossing a busy street in the city. 



Others are terrified by flying and drive instead, even though there were nearly 34,000 automotive fatalities in 2009 in the U.S., compared with 50 on scheduled planes. 



People stay up at night worrying about the 5% increase in sunburn‐​causing radiation as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion, and the next morning go to the beach and expose 95% of their skin to the same rays.





A]s a society, we are increasingly illiterate in matters of science and technology.



Here’s some perspective on Fukushima, and what it is being compared to, the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which ended nuclear power plant construction in the U.S.



Radiation is measured in “sieverts.” One sievert, if experienced all at once, is likely to make you pretty nauseated, and 3.5 sieverts is the level that kills 50% of exposed people. A thousandth of a sievert, which has no detectable effect on health, is called a millisievert. A millionth, or a microsievert, is what you get from eating 10 natural bananas.



The average _total_ excess radiation dose for a person living within 10 miles of the partially melted down Three Mile Island reactor core in 1979 was approximately 80 microsieverts, or less than one ten‐​thousandth of a potentially fatal dose.



You probably know some people who eat 800 bananas a year. They may be bloated, but they are not dead. 



For comparative purposes, the average person receives a dose of about 3650 microsieverts per year–about 85% of that is from natural sources, and most of the rest is from medical scans. 



Measurement from 46 sites within 19 miles of the damaged reactors in Fukushima are generally at or near background levels. There are three sites showing doses of approximately 3.6 millisieverts per day between 12 and 19 miles northwest of the site, but it is unclear whether this is from the power plant or a large strip mine close to the monitors. 



Evan Douple, an expert in the effects of radioactivity and health, notes that “At these levels so far, I don’t think a study would be able to measure that there would be any health effects.” This is from a person who has dedicated his life to the study of the effects of the Hiroshima bomb.



One old environmental adage is “the solution to pollution is dilution.” Generally ( _very_ generally, I might add), the concentration of a pollutant, whether it is coming from an exploded oil well _a la_ Macando Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico or from a damaged Fukushima nuclear reactor, falls off at some exponential function of the distance from the source. This relationship has to be modified by prevailing weather conditions, which makes it much more complicated. Some, such as strong winds, may result in higher concentrations downstream than expected from simply exponential decay, while others, like precipitation, effectively cleanse the atmosphere.



But, like so many of our economist friends, let’s assume the simpler (and somewhat more unrealistic) “model.” At a 2 mile radius, there’s only one‐​fourth of the concentration there is at one mile. At 10 miles, a hundredth; at a thousand, a millionth–all of which simply proves that there will never be a health effect from Fukushima found in California.



So why are we so concerned? One reason may be that, as a society, we are increasingly illiterate in matters of science and technology. How many people have it in their fund of knowledge that the more radioactive a substance is, the less radioactive it gets over time? How many people realize that there is such a rapid fall‐​off of the concentration of a water or airborne pollutant the farther one gets from the source? How many know that exposing 95% of their skin to the sun at the beach is far more dangerous than slight changes in damaging solar radiation caused by the loss of stratospheric ozone?



This type of irrationality bleeds over into weather and climate. A category two hurricane still commands the full and complete attention of all the media if it threatens the U.S., even as the number of deaths from land‐​falling storms plummets (2005 Hurricane Katrina being a notable exception).



In fact, it’s quite clear that despite the fashionable fear of all things related to climate, an economically vibrant society actually adapts to weather threats and consequently prospers.



The hurricane is a particularly instructive example. In 1955 an extremely destructive (category 5) Hurricane Janet struck near Chetumal, Mexico, on the Yucatan Peninsula, killing over 600 as it came ashore. In 2007, another fiver, Hurricane Dean, made landfall in nearly the same spot and killed _not one person_.



The differences between 1955 and 2007 in this part of Mexico are in economic development, infrastructure (roads and electricity), communication of hurricane forecasts and technology. 



We have seen a similar decline in mortality from tornadoes, where the death rate, that is the number of deaths per million, has declined a remarkable 90% in the last 100 years. Score another victory for economic development and technology. 



Which brings us to the subject of global warming. The atmosphere’s response to all the carbon dioxide we have loaded it with has been remarkably lukewarm, consistently hanging below the average of the United Nations’ “midrange” climate models. So has the change in sea level. We adapt to these slow changes without even noticing them. Though it is unclear whether or not global warming has anything to do with this, tropical cyclone (hurricanes, typhoons and their ilk) activity has spun down to the lowest level ever measured.



Nonetheless, if you want to cause a hellacious fight, just write these words: Global warming is not going to kill you. Nor is radiation from Fukushima. Have a banana.

By Ed Caryl
In my last article on this subject, Can We Expect Extreme Weather, we examined the tropics, the mid-latitudes including the Arctic. At the time I had not found a plot of the mid-latitudes in isolation. Thanks to a comment by Alex, the search was resumed. Once one knows that data exists, it becomes easier to actually find it.
In this article we will examine the mid-latitudes alone, the latitudes between 25° north and 60° north, where most people live, and where most of the earth’s land mass exists. Again, we are using Remote Sensing Systems satellite data. 

Figure 1: RSS lower troposphere temperature, (TLT) for the northern mid-latitudes between 25° north and 60° north, show cooling. The plot has been split between pre-1998 and post-1998.
1998 was the year of a very strong El Niño. In that year northern hemisphere temperatures took a step increase of about 0.4°C. Before that time, temperatures in the mid-latitudes were increasing from the 1970’s cooling at about 0.144°C per decade, despite the temporary cooling due to Mt. Pinatubo in 1992 and 93. After the 1998 El Niño step, the mid-latitudes began cooling again at about 0.123°C per decade. This natural recovery continues.
What are the extremes doing?

//-->




Figure 2 is a plot of the differential, point to point, of the temperature anomalies in Figure 1. These are the monthly extremes with the long term trend removed.
Note in Figure 2 that the northern mid-latitudes responded to the El Niño temperature step with several cold snaps (below zero) that continue to this day; monthly extremes that exceed the cold snaps of the 1980’s and 90’s. In contrast, the warm periods (above zero) are about the same in frequency and amplitude.

Figure 3 is a plot of the absolute value of the temperature extremes in Figure 2 with a 3rd order polynomial trend line applied.
If we look at the trend of all the extremes in the satellite era, we see a reduced trend in the 1980’s, an increase after the 1998 El Niño, particularly due to cold extremes, then a reduction in extremes in the last ten years.
Regarding the climate that most of us experience, in the northern mid-latitudes, we have cooling, a recent overall reduction in extreme weather, and no indication these conditions are radically changing.
It would be helpful if the Catastrophic Climate Clique would actually look at some data once in a while instead of hiding it and crying wolf. (How about a cartoon, Josh.)

"A leading Australian business group is calling for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying it would boost growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, representing more than 60,000 businesses, says economic recovery from the virus and the transition required to meet net-zero emissions by 2050 are overlapping issues that should be taken on together.  “There’s a lot that we can do to rebuild stronger and cleaner,” Willox planned to say on Tuesday, according to a speech released in advance. “The need is urgent. Covid-19 and climate are bigger than any economic challenge we’ve faced in the last century.” Willox is among a band of community leaders and industry groups urging governments to back climate solutions in the pandemic recovery rather than projects that entrench or increase emissions. They include the Investor Agenda, a global group of institutional investors and managers with members responsible for more than $55tn worth of assets. In a statement released on Monday, it said governments should avoid prioritising “risky, short-term emissions intensive projects”, and that accelerating the shift to net-zero emissions could create significant employment and economic growth while improving energy security and clean air. “The path we choose in the coming months will have significant ramifications for our global economy and generations to come,” the group, which includes Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said. In Australia, visions for a “clean recovery” or “renewables stimulus” will be the focus of two online industry summits this week. Speakers include the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and energy ministers from four states. The emphasis of the summits differs from that of the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has backed gas, a fossil fuel, as key to driving the recovery after a slump in global oil and gas prices. John Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, which is hosting a summit on Wednesday, said the country needed to tackle the current economic crisis and the climate crisis at the same time or it would “lurch from one major problem to another”. “This is Australia’s moment to modernise and grow the economy, create hundreds of thousands of new future-proof jobs and position Australia as a global renewable energy superpower,” Grimes said. Willox planned to tell a separate forum hosted by the Clean Energy Council on Tuesday that last summer’s bushfires had been a preview of what lay ahead due to climate change. His speech notes said a successful energy transition must leave no-one behind and extend beyond electricity generation to include heavy industry, transport, agriculture, buildings “and more”. “There is immense scope for reform and investment to support that transition, and getting started during the crisis will contribute to faster recovery,” he said. He said the industry group had consulted widely on “the most constructive directions for recovery and transition”. Opportunities raised included: improving energy management in homes and buildings by plugging drafts, modernising equipment and backing local electricity generation and storage; boosting electricity networks by rolling out smart meters and moving edge-of-grid customers on to mini-grids; helping shift heavy industry to run on clean electricity and hydrogen; and supporting large and small energy storage. On transport, Willox said it was an excellent time to prepare cities and major corridors for mass take up of electric vehicles by installing or preparing for charging points at service stations, in public and government car parks, and at apartment blocks. He said governments would have different preferences on whether to use regulatory reform, tax incentives, grants or other approaches. Giving the example of electricity, he said settling on a sound long-term design for market rules and climate policy could do as much to boost investment as direct public financial support. A report by the Clean Energy Council, also released on Tuesday, estimated that 50,000 construction and 4,000 ongoing jobs could be created, and $50bn worth of renewable electricity and storage projects built, if governments backed green policies and regulatory reform to “jumpstart” the economy. It said it would require help to overcome policy and grid transmission roadblocks that led to large-scale wind and solar investments falling 50% last year, changes to electricity market rules so the full benefits of energy storage were reflected and support for renewable hydrogen. On a smaller scale, it would mean governments removing barriers for renters, low-income households and community groups installing solar and supporting home batteries by either reducing costs or offering low-interest loans. Kane Thornton, the Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, said there were hundreds of large-scale wind and solar projects with planning approval that could proceed quickly, create jobs and bring down prices. “This isn’t about a handout for industry when government is directing scarce taxpayer funding to other essential services and areas,” Thornton said. “There is an enormous appetite for private investment in clean energy that can be unlocked through smart regulatory reform, sensible energy policy and investment in the grid and energy storage.” The International Energy Agency last week reported a “staggering” plunge in global demand for coal, oil and gas during the pandemic, with only renewable electricity proving resilient."

For more than two weeks Hurricane Hermine (including, its pre-hurricane and post-hurricane life) was prominent in the daily news cycle. It threatened, at one time or another, destruction along U.S. coastlines from the southern tip of Florida westward to New Orleans and northward to Cape Cod. Hurricane/global warming stories, relegated to the hell of the formerly attractive by the record-long absence of a major hurricane strike on U.S. shores, were being spiffed up and readied for publication just as soon as disaster would strike. But, alas, Hermine didn’t cooperate, arguably generating more bluster in the press than on the ground, although some very exposed stretches of North Florida did incur some damage.   
  
Like Jessie, Woody and Stinky Pete in _Toy Story 2_ , the hurricane/global warming stories have been put back in their boxes (if only they could be sent to a museum!).    
  
But, they didn’t have to be. There was much that could have been written speculating on the role of global warming in the Hermine’s evolution—but it’s just not politically correct.   
  
With a bit of thought-provocation provided by newly-minted Cato Adjunct Scholar Dr. Ryan Maue—one of the best and brightest minds in the world on issues of tropical cyclone/climate interactions (and other extreme weather types)—we’ll review Hermine’s life history and consider what factors “consistent with” human-caused climate change may have shaped its outcome.



We look forward to having Ryan’s more formal input into our future climate change discussions, but didn’t want to pass up an opportunity to work some of his thoughts into our Hermine recap—for who knows, we may have to wait another 10 years for a Florida hurricane landfall!   
  
Hermine was probably the most hyped category 1 hurricane in history—thanks to a large media constituency hungry for weather disaster stories to link with climate change peril.   
  
Widespread access to weather forecast models and a thirst to be first with the story of impending global-warming fueled doom led to wild speculation in the media (both new and traditional) about “worst case scenarios” of a “major hurricane” landfall nearly a full week prior to the nascent swirl in the tropical atmosphere becoming an officially designated tropical cyclone by the National Hurricane Center. As “Invest 99L” (as it was originally designated) trudged westward through the tropical Atlantic environs during the week of August 22nd, it was struggling to maintain its life, much less its worst case aspirations. Pretty much every day you could find reports of a potentially dire impact from the Florida East Coast all the way through waterlogged Louisiana.   
  
To hear it told, the combination of unusually warm water, the lack of recent hurricane landfalls and rising sea levels set the stage for a disaster.   
  
Invest 99L ultimately did survive an unfavorable stretch of environmental conditions in the Florida Straits and eventually, in the Gulf of Mexico, grew into Hurricane Hermine and became the first in over 10 years to make landfall in Florida when it came ashore near St. Marks in the early morning hours of Friday, September 2nd. It was a category 1 hurricane at landfall and caused some coastal flooding along Florida’s Gulf Coast and knocked out power to more than 100,000 homes and businesses in the Tallahassee area. In reality, no hurricane-force sustained winds were measured onshore.   
  
As it traversed the Southeastern U.S. from Florida’s Big Bend region to North Carolina’s Outer Banks, the Labor Day forecast for Jersey Shore became ominous, as Hermine’s post-tropical personality was expected to lash the Mid-Atlantic coast with near-hurricane force winds for several days, flooding low-lying areas and severely eroding beaches with each tidal cycle. Many Labor Day holiday plans were cancelled.   
  
As it turned out, Hermine’s post-tropical remnants travelled further offshore than originally anticipated and never quite attainted projected strength—a combination which resulted in much less onshore impact than was being advertised, with much grumbling from those who felt had cancelled their vacation plans for nothing.   
  
In the end, Hermine’s hype was much worse than its bite. But all the while, if folks _really_ wanted to write stories about how storm behavior is “consistent with” factors related to global warming, they most certainly could.   
  
For example, regarding Hermine, Ryan sent out this string of post-event tweets:   
  
  




As is well known, we have gone much further than we ever have without a Category 3 (major) or higher hurricane strike. The last was nearly 11 years ago, when Wilma struck south Florida on October 24, 2005. With regard to this and the reduced frequency of U.S. strikes in general, hurricane researcher Chunzai Wang from NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory gave an informative presentation about a year ago, titled “Impacts of the Atlantic Warm Pool on Atlantic Hurricanes.” It included this bullet point:   




● A large (small) [Atlantic Warm Pool—a condition enhanced by global warming] is unfavorable (favorable) for hurricanes to make landfall in the southeast United States. _This is consistent with that no hurricanes made landfall in the southeast U.S. during the past 10 years_ , or hurricanes moved northward such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. [emphasis added]



In an article we wrote a few years back titled “Global Savings: Billion-Dollar Weather Events Averted by Global Warming,” we listed several other examples of elements “consistent with” climate change that may inhibit Atlantic tropical cyclone development and avert, or mitigate, disaster—these include increased vertical wind shear, changes in atmospheric steering currents, and Saharan dust injections.   
  
But, you have probably never read any stories elsewhere that human-caused climate changes may be acting to lessen the menace of Atlantic hurricane strikes on the U.S. Instead you’ve no doubt read that “dumb luck” is the reason why hurricanes have been eluding our shores and why, according to the _Washington Post_ , our decade-plus major hurricane drought is “terrifying” (in part, because of climate change).   
  
We have little wonder why.

"Darwin’s finches, a group of 14 species found only in the Galapagos Islands, are perhaps most well known as one of the inspirations for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. A classic example of adaptive evolutionary radiation, the species are similar having formed from a common ancestor, except for their beaks, which have specialised to tackle different food.  Invasive pests and parasites are a problem in many parts of the word, and have even reached the Galapagos: a parasitic nest fly Philornis downsi has spread to most islands in the archipelago and is wreaking havoc on Darwin’s eponymous finches and other birds. The fly’s larvae live in the birds’ nests where they feed on the young birds’ blood, sometimes killing the entire brood. This parasitic fly might be the final nail in the coffin of some critically endangered species of Darwin’s finches, such as the mangrove finch and medium tree finch. So finding a way of controlling the pest is a top priority at the Galapagos National Park and Charles Darwin Research Station (CDRS), and with a novel method of putting pesticides right where it hits the pests – in the nest – we think we’ve found a solution. One afternoon while lounging in my hammock at CDRS I noticed a female finch land on my laundry line. I snapped a few photos of her as she tugged cotton fibres from a frayed knot. As she flew off with the collected fibres in her beak, I wondered if finches would incorporate cotton treated with a low concentration (1%) of a mild insecticide (permethrin) into their nests. We have used permethrin to kill the parasite in Darwin’s finch nests for years without harm to the birds, and if the finches took the cotton they would be threading their nests with the very weapon they need to kill P. downsi.  Later that day, I pinned cotton balls sprayed with permethrin to the laundry line. Within a few days, all of the cotton balls had disappeared from the rope. Inspired by these observations, my colleagues and I designed an experiment in 2013 to test whether Darwin’s finches could be encouraged to “self-fumigate” their nests with cotton balls treated with permethrin. Separately, we also directly sprayed other nests with permethrin to determine if killing the parasites would increase finch nestling survival.   Our research team built 30 cotton dispensers, a bit like suet bird feeders but with cotton balls to pluck instead of food. Some were loaded with pesticide-treated cotton and others with water-treated cotton as a control, and we placed these around our main field site, El Garrapatero on the island of Santa Cruz.  Then over several months, we battled uneven lava rock underfoot and 40°C heat in search of finch nests. During an especially difficult day, I saw for the first time a finch taking cotton from a dispenser and bringing it back to her nest – a nest which turned out to contain nearly two grams of cotton. With more than 85% of the nests we found containing cotton, the finches certainly liked it as a nesting material. But did the pesticide work? We found that nests which contained more than one gramme of permethrin-treated cotton (62% of nests) were virtually parasite-free, compared to nests with untreated cotton, which contained on average 30 parasites. Those nests that were sprayed directly with permethrin also had fewer parasites and more surviving nestlings. Given the tools to do so, finches can carry out their own pest control. Since the fly is found almost everywhere in the Galapagos, we do not believe that it will develop resistance to permethrin, especially if the dispensaries are used over a smaller area. We believe that self-fumigation can be especially useful for endangered species such as the mangrove finch – this Darwin’s finch species is down to fewer than 80 remaining individuals. We presented our findings, now published in Current Biology, to researchers at CDRS, who are now putting out untreated cotton for mangrove finches to determine if they will be interested in the nest material. Self-fumigation provides an immediate solution to the parasite problem while other long-term methods are developed. Of course there are other species of birds that are hurt by parasites, and if those birds too can be encouraged to incorporate fumigated cotton into their nests, they should be able to reap the benefits too. For example, Hawaiian honeycreepers become infested with feather lice, birds in Puerto Rico are afflicted by Philornis flies, and the endangered Florida scrub jay suffers from parasitic fleas. The same method might be used for the black-tailed prairie dog, which while removed from the endangered species list is still declining on the Great Plains and is affected by flea-bourne plague. Spraying permethrin directly into burrows has been used but is labour-intensive – it might be possible to spray the pesticide onto vegetation that the animals then drag into their burrows."

Members of a bipartisan coalition of US lawmakers are accusing the Chinese of a plot to manipulate the value of its currency in order to boost its exports and make American imports harder to sell in China.



And the lawmakers have introduced legislation that would force the US Treasury to impose stiff penalties against China and other countries that are engaged in such unfair currency manipulation.



In the House of Representatives 130 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter protesting China’s manipulation of its currency while in the Senate, a group of 14 Democrats and Republicans are pressing the Obama Administration to act against the Chinese.



The senators, led by liberal Democrat Charles Schumer from New York and conservative Republican Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, are arguing that past US administrations, worried about the rising economic power of China, had refrained from identifying Beijing as a ‘currency manipulator’ which would then have required Washington to impose duties on Chinese imports. But with unemployment rate remaining high and as the US trade deficit with China — its second largest trading partner — keeps growing, American lawmakers are responding to public anger by blaming China for using its currency to gain a trade advantage.



The senators want to ensure that the US Treasury’s semi‐​annual report on foreign exchange rate practices that is scheduled to be released next month will, indeed, label China as a ‘currency manipulator’ and force the administration to come up with ‘remedial’ legislation that would supposedly compel China to revalue its currency.



Their Bill — ‘Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Act’ — was introduced following a war of words between the US and China in recent days over the allegedly misaligned Chinese currency, the yuan, as well as other policy issues, including the meeting between President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama at the White House, the US decision to sell arms to Taiwan as well as complaints from American companies about Chinese trade practices and Sino‐​American disagreements over climate change.



And while the American economy has just started recovering from a painful recession and is showing some growth, the World Bank this week has upped its forecast for China’s 2010 GDP growth to 9.5 per cent after it grew at 8.7 per cent last year.



American lawmakers say that some of this impressive export driven economic growth has been achieved in part through Chinese currency manipulation.



The Chinese policies amount to ‘cheating’, according to Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow which represents Michigan, a state whose manufacturing sector, including a struggling car industry, has been devastated by the Great Recession and where the official unemployment rate is around 15 per cent (and among African‐​Americans, close to 50 per cent).



She and her colleagues are complaining that the Chinese government is essentially subsidising its exports by keeping its currency value low and want Washington to stop talking and to finally walk the walk. The Obama Administration needs to pull ‘the trigger on (currency) manipulation, explains Mr Graham, whose own state of South Carolina has been experiencing an unemployment rate of more than 13 per cent.



He told reporters that ‘we’re all living in fear of what China might do’ since ‘we borrow way too much money from them’, adding that ‘we need to break that fear and do what’s right’.



China has approximately US$2.4 trillion of accumulated foreign reserves which explains why many economists believe that the yuan is undervalued as a result of a calculated policy pursued by China’s financial authorities. They buy US dollars and sell their own yuan, a policy that helps to keep the greenback’s exchange rate fixed to their own currency. The result is a distortion of trade flows — cheap Chinese exports to the US continue while imports from the US into China remain expensive.



But since the Chinese do not allow their currency to float freely, the same economists also disagree over the degree to which the Chinese undervalue their currency. Economists also differ in estimating the extent to which the appreciation of the Chinese currency will lead to the narrowing of the US trade deficit with China. After all, reducing that deficit seems to be the main rationale for the proposed legislation on Capitol Hill.



In fact, according to the Cato Institute’s trade analyst Dan Ikenson, from 2005 to 2008, at a time when the yuan was appreciating against the US dollar, the US trade deficit with China actually increased from US$202 billion to US$268 billion. Thus, the think tank’s analyst suggests, the level of the US deficit is determined by many factors other than just the value of the Chinese currency.



For example, Mr Ikenson points out that the yuan was growing stronger between 2005 and 2008, US imports from China increased by US$94.3 billion, or 38.7 per cent. He suggests that one reason for continued US consumption of Chinese goods despite the relative price increase may have been the shortage of or even the lack of substitutes for Chinese‐​made goods in the US market.



Moreover, only somewhere one‐​third and one‐​half of the value of US imports from China is actually Chinese value‐​added, with the other half to two‐​thirds reflecting costs of material, labour and inputs from other countries.



Hence, a stronger yuan actually makes imported inputs cheaper for Chinese producers, who may respond by reducing their prices for export, which means that the currency appreciation may lead to a rise — not a reduction — of American imports from China.



Unfortunately, much of this economic common sense is probably not going to counter the political pressure from Congress on the administration to ‘do something’ that is fuelled, in turn, by America’s economic distress and the ensuing populism that makes China such an easy target.



A key Chinese official responded to this pressure from Congress by saying that his government has become a convenient scapegoat for America’s trade problems. But this official needs to recognise that that kind of behaviour is a mirror image of sort of the way that some members of the Chinese communist establishment have been exploiting anti‐​American nationalist sentiment as part of a strategy to mobilise public support for the regime in Beijing.



In a way, scapegoating the ‘other’ seemed to have become the favourite political weapon by both Americans and the Chinese.



The problem is that the back and forth sniping between Washington and Beijing over China’s currency policy is more than just a ‘normal’ economic dispute between two countries that has been exploited by politicians on both sides.



Indeed, the global financial imbalances between the US (consumption that created deficits) and China (savings that produce surpluses) helped create the conditions for the financial melt‐​down.



And unless the two sides take steps to deal with these imbalances, the global financial system could experience more disasters in the future.



From that perspective, China’s massive trade and foreign exchange surpluses — reflecting the huge surpluses of exports over imports and saving over investment — should be seen not so much as a challenge to American economic interests but as a threat to the entire global economy, and eventually to China itself.



The Americans need to cut their consumption and borrowing. But that could only take place if the US dollars in China’s government‐​controlled banks are being spent to buy American products as opposed to its debts. And if and when that happens, the appreciation of the Chinese currency would be inevitable.



In the meantime, a Chinese refusal to revalue its currency is bound to bring about retaliatory action by Washington and ignite a destructive economic war between the two nations.



And the situation is only going to be aggravated if China continues to respond in a somewhat frantic way to not‐​very‐​unusual actions by the Obama Administration (meetings with the Dalai Lama or arms sales to Taiwan).



If anything, China’s rising economic and diplomatic power require it to embrace a more nuanced, if not refined, diplomacy that one expects from a great power, especially when it is dealing with the more accommodating administration in Washington.



More important, there is no reason why China and the US should not be able to settle their differences over currency in the same amicable way that the US and Japan were able to during the 1980s.



A failure to do that would be a recipe for another economic recession and perhaps even a new cold war from which no side would be able to decouple.

Mississippi homeowners sued 34 energy companies and utilities operating in the Gulf Coast for damage sustained to their property during Hurricane Katrina. The homeowners alleged that the defendants had emitted greenhouse gases, which increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contributed to global warming, which accelerated the melting of glaciers, which raised the global sea level, which increased the frequency and severity of hurricanes, which caused the destructive force of Hurricane Katrina. The district court concluded that it lacked the authority to resolve the public debate over global warming and dismissed the case. A Fifth Circuit panel reversed this dismissal, however, holding that the homeowners have standing to raise some of their claims and that those claims are appropriate for resolution by the federal courts. The Fifth Circuit granted the defendants’ petition for rehearing _en banc_. Cato filed an _amicus_ brief on the energy companies’ behalf, arguing that homeowners lack standing to bring their suit and that the case raises a nonjusticiable political question. Our brief asserts that the homeowners’ claim does not provide a clear causal connection between the harm suffered and any particular conduct by the energy companies, and that the money damages the homeowners requested would not remedy the environmental harm alleged. More importantly, we maintain that political questions such as those surrounding climate change must be resolved by Congress, not the federal courts. Put simply, the Constitution prohibits federal courts from resolving highly technical social and economic policy debates. Permitting plaintiffs to achieve “regulation by litigation” would not only contradict settled Supreme Court precedent, but would betray the separation of powers principles embodied in the Constitution.

Restrictions at this level see cafes, pubs and restaurants allowed to open until 18:00 to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks to groups of up to six from two households. Alcohol sales are not permitted indoors or outdoors. All leisure and entertainment venues are closed, including cinemas. No non-essential travel is allowed out of a level three area. Indoor exercise, which includes gyms, are restricted to individual and not group exercise.
In this tier there is no in-home socialising allowed and up to six people from two households can meet outdoors and in hospitality settings. Licensed premises can only serve alcohol indoors with a main meal - and then only until 20:00. Outdoors, you can be served until 22:30. Most leisure and entertainment premises are closed except gyms, cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades.
Six people from two households can meet indoors if they are resident in Shetland, the Western Isles and Orkney. This does not apply to the other council areas. Level one sees a ""reasonable"" degree of normality. Hospitality has a 22:30 curfew. Events, like weddings, would be restricted to a maximum of 20 people. Indoor contact sports for adults are not permitted. Only those unable to work from home should go to their place of employment. Up to eight people from three households can meet outdoors.
No local authority has been assigned this level. At level zero, hospitality would operate ""almost normally"" - subject to rules on physical distancing, limits on numbers and other rules, such as table service.

"The ocean, seen from a beach or from a plane, seems vast, ancient and invulnerable. It’s hard to imagine that 90% of life on earth lives below the waves, across 1.3 billion cubic kilometres of water and across a seabed formed by mountain ranges, vast plains and trenches that reach 11,000 metres deep.  Every other breath we take is filled with oxygen that originates from photosynthesising marine life, the ocean provides billions of us with food, and in other ways provides a critical role in supporting the ecology of the planet. Yet much of this is simply not recognised, and certainly not valued.  Our relationship with the ocean has become abusive. Industrial fishing has led to a catastrophic collapse of both target species and those taken as by-catch. The number of many of the iconic ocean predators – tuna, swordfish, sharks, and even cod – have been reduced to less than 10% of their original abundance. The great whales were almost hunted to extinction by the mid-20th century, and some species still struggle to survive.  Seabirds, drowned or killed as collateral damage from fishing, die in their hundreds of thousands a year, pushing some towards extinction. Our inexorable appetite for profit from fisheries has led us to trawl deep and remote ecosystems for fish. Having evolved to survive at great depths where there is limited food, these fish can live for more than 100 years and reproduce slowly, and so are extremely vulnerable to overfishing. Even the method of fishing itself destroys habitats such as deep-sea coral reefs and sponge gardens which support an enormous diversity of life. And of course the ocean is affected not just by what we take out, but by what we put in: pollution, particularly plastic debris, ocean acidification from the effects of climate change, and deoxygenation caused by nitrate fertiliser washed into the sea from fields also cause problems for marine life. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by this tragic spiral of degradation, but it is still the greatest wilderness on Earth and in places teems with beautiful and majestic life. Many of the human activities damaging the oceans can be modified, reduced to promote recovery, or even eliminated. The latest report of the Global Ocean Commission is a “rescue package” of eight practical recommendations that can reverse this decline. It is nothing less than a Marshall Plan for the oceans, a reflection of the scale of the emergency we face.  The commission’s rescue package calls for a Sustainable Development Goal for the oceans, to emphasise the need to use the ocean’s resources sustainably, now and for the future.  It outlines steps that would make fisheries more sustainable. Some of these are incredibly simple. Requiring fishing vessels to carry a mandatory identification number, as other merchant vessels must, could make enforcing fishing regulations much easier. Better still, tracking vessels using Automated Identification Systems and other satellite tracking systems already in use would provide the means to know who is fishing where, and even what and how they are fishing.  These two simple steps would quickly make it very hard for illegal fishing vessels to go unnoticed in the vastness of the oceans. Combined with improved port state control of fisheries landings, this could eliminate illegally caught fish from  supermarkets, destroying pirate fishers’ profits. Other recommendations address more difficult political issues such as overcapacity in fishing fleets, subsidies that lead to overfishing, and flag-state responsibility for the action of their vessels at sea.   Many of the commissioners’ recommendations are such clear and obvious choices that it’s reasonable to ask why they haven’t been implemented long ago. The ocean is governed mainly through the principles of the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, but its implementation is spread across many sector-specific organisations that leads to a disconnection between exploiting the oceans and the need to conserve them. This has made it easy for national and commercial interests to undermine ocean governance for collective benefit.  Nowhere has this been more acute that in the high seas, beyond the territorial area that extends 200 nautical miles from the coast that is subject to international regulation. The commission’s final recommendation is that, if we cannot clean up our act and manage the high seas better, they, or at least those portions that are unregulated, should be entirely closed to fishing to allow them to recover.  Two scientists, Crow White and Christopher Costello, recently modelled such a closure and found that it would lead to increasing fish stocks, and as a result greater and more sustainable fish catches. It would also deliver a more equitable sharing of the ocean’s resources, as the investment and technology to build large, ocean-going vessels is limited to the developed nations. Given the degradation of the oceans and a burgeoning human population predicted to reach 9 billion or more by the middle of the century we cannot allow nineteenth-century-style politics to rule the waves. It is time to act collectively to rescue the oceans so that they continue to provide critical services and inspiration for our children and for generations thereafter. "

Amidst the many headline‐​grabbing moments of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, both parties released their platforms for the 2016 election. While both platforms mentioned the U.S.-China relationship, there was very little room for agreement on how the United States should deal with China in the years to come. The Republicans and Democrats both displayed some “dragon slayer” tendencies — after all nobody wants to look weak in international politics. But the platforms showed substantive differences on how Washington should deal with Beijing.



The Democrats: Continuing the Pivot



The core of the Democratic platform is the Obama administration’s “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, which was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. The platform considers East Asian allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines to be essential for achieving U.S. interests in the region. According to the platform, “We will also work with our allies and partners to fortify regional institutions and norms as well as protect freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.” Importantly, allies are not explicitly called on to balance against China or try to contain its rise.





No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.



The primary source of hawkish language on China in the Democratic platform is found on page 49. The platform states, “We will stand up to Beijing on unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, censorship of the internet, piracy, and cyberattacks.” However, and in stark contrast to the Republican platform, the very next sentence mentions “areas of cooperation” with Beijing that the Democrats will pursue. Seeking cooperation with China on issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation and standing up to Beijing when important interests are threatened is a continuation of the Obama administration’s policies.



If Hillary Clinton wins in November and follows through on this platform, then expect the United States to stay the course in the pivot to Asia. Whether or not this policy will achieve its intended goals is questionable given China’s intransigence in response to the Obama administration’s policies, but Beijing likely prefers a continuation of the pivot to the harsh stance spelled out in the GOP platform.



The Republicans: China is the Enemy, and We Will Defeat It



The Republican platform is adamant about the threat China poses to the United States and cooperation is practically impossible. According to the Republicans, the United States has tried playing nice with China, but has gotten nothing in return besides unfair trade policies, regional instability, grave human rights violations, and the revival of “the cult of Mao.” Chinese activities in the South China Sea are one example of how the Obama administration’s weakness has “invited aggression.” China is presented as an enemy, and the United States does not cooperate with its enemies.



The Republican platform is also more hawkish on Taiwan. Taiwan’s democratic system of government, human rights record, and open economy are “saluted” in the GOP platform, but not in the Democratic platform. This makes American support for, and if need be defense of, Taiwan essential for normative, not just practical reasons. Additionally, the Republicans affirm the Six Assurances to Taiwan made by President Reagan in 1982, which the Democratic platform does not mention.



Implementing the GOP platform would put the United States into an outright adversarial relationship with China characterized by greater U.S. criticism of China’s human rights record and activities in cyberspace, and a stronger U.S. military stance to prevent weakness from inviting aggression. However, it is unclear how much of the platform would be implemented by Donald Trump if he is elected president. His tough talk on economic issues suggests adherence to those aspects of the platform, but weakening U.S. alliance relationships could undermine the platform’s language on Taiwan and the treaty allies.



Both the Republican and Democratic platforms reflect a willingness to get tougher with China, albeit in different ways and to a different degree. The Democrats want to continue the pivot to Asia and strengthen the alliance system that Chinese leaders see as a vehicle for containment. The Republicans want to reclaim a moral high ground and confront China on its human rights record, territorial ambitions, and cyber activities. No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.

It was most disconcerting to see grown men on the west coast crying because Eugenie Sage and her minions have threatened to shut down recreational white baiting – a family tradition. With support of the Greens, Forest & Bird (F&B) are throwing their weight around far more than they did before the Greens crawled into government, and it’s got out of hand. 



F&B have carte blanche to oppose developments that don’t fit their ideology and already they have:



F&B have far too much say in[ important decisions like the Te Kuha ](https://www.doc.govt.nz/news/issues/decision-on-mining-application-at-mt-te-kuha/)mine that would have provided jobs and funded local industry. Ministers declined the mining permit because “the potential economic benefits of the mine were large enough to outweigh the irreparable damage to an area with very high, unique and nationally significant conservation values.” 



The decision should have read **“ministers declined the mining permit because** **this government opposes all mining.”**



Where is the burden of proof in spurious actions by F&B? Closing Waitakere walking tracks **might** prevent kauri die-back? Auckland stormwater **could** contain contaminants? 



**F &B lost the fight at Waiuku**, where residents have, for decades, been maintaining their shoreline, with the support of the Auckland City Council to the tune of $10,000 pa for work and chainsaw maintenance.



“An environmental group **[Forest and Bird] says it is “shocked”** to see Auckland Council promoting the work of a community group that **has cleared** **25 hectares of mangroves from an estuary as “positive** “.



“Mangroves are amazing native plants that have important roles in the environment. They protect our coastal communities from inundation from the sea by slowing down waves and absorbing flood waters, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere to help prevent climate change, and provide essential nursery habitat for fishes, and feeding grounds for native birds like at-risk banded rail.” 



**But Waiuku residents are much better informed about their own environment, particularly the mangroves and the banded rail, than F &B. **



WAIUKU RESIDENT IAN SCOBIE, WHO STARTED THE MANGROVE REMOVAL PROJECT INITIALLY TO CLEAR A PASSAGE FOR HIM TO KAYAK INTO THE ESTUARY, SAID FROM THEIR OBSERVATIONS THE REMOVAL HAD IMPROVED THE ENVIRONMENT. 



**“WE FOUND** **AS WE CLEARED THE AREAS WE GOT VERY POSITIVE EFFECTS, WITH FISH, BIRDS, CRABS – YOU NAME IT – RETURNING, PLUS THE ADDED IMPROVEMENT OF THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT WITH BOATING AND THE AESTHETIC APPEARANCE**.” 



SCOBIE SAID THEY HAD BEEN PLANTING THE SHORELINE IN NATIVE RUSH SPECIES, THOSE THAT WERE THERE PRIOR TO THE MANGROVES, TO COUNTER EROSION AND SEDIMENT ENTERING THE ESTUARY, AND TO ENHANCE THE BANDED RAIL HABITAT. 



**“WE BELIEVE THE RUSHES ARE ACTUALLY A BETTER HABITAT FOR THE BANDED RAIL** **THAN THE MANGROVES.** ” 



F&B was forced to back away from Waiuku and are now gunning for the development of a marina at Coromandel – 10 years in the planning.



_“_ **FOREST & BIRD IS URGING THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO FUND AN ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING MARINA DEVELOPMENT IN COROMANDEL** _._



THE PROJECT WOULD INVOLVE **DIGGING OUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT AND MANGROVES** ON THE MARGINS OF COROMANDEL HARBOUR TO CONSTRUCT A MARINA BASIN AND DREDGING A CANAL TO DEEPER WATER.



 **DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS, THAMES COROMANDEL DISTRICT COUNCIL HAS COMMISSIONED STUDIES THAT SHOWED ELEVATED LEVELS OF HEAVY METALS, INCLUDING ARSENIC AND MERCURY, IN THE SEA FLOOR OF COROMANDEL HARBOUR**. 



DREDGING **COULD** RELEASE THESE TOXIC HEAVY METALS INTO THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM, HARMING A WIDE RANGE OF SEA LIFE, SAYS DR STIRNEMANN.” 



  
F&B is all about protecting mangroves, which encourage silt to build up, and they also argue that dredging **could** release toxic heavy metals into the marine system. F&B was wrong at Waiuku and they are quite likely wrong in the Coromandel too. 



If the TCDC has spent 10 years in planning and studying their own back yard who is F&B to wade into this?



The proposed ferry service to operate from the new Coromandel marina would get cars off the road by offering travel by sea but the Greens take no account of this advantage for the Coromandel. 



With the support of a handful of un-elected Greens, F&B will oppose anything and they are often succeeding, despite the facts not stacking up. They are nothing more than bullies who should be stopped in their tracks by withdrawing government funding.

First, a disclaimer. I don’t listen to NPR. “State radio” bugs me. But I have friends who do, and I was bowled over when one sent me a seemingly innocuous story about the search for a pharmaceutical treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS], the horrific ailment also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease.   
  
  
I knew something big was about to happen when correspondent Richard Harris led off with this zinger:   




There’s a funding crunch for biomedical research in the United States—and it’s not just causing pain for scientists and universities. It’s also creating incentives for researchers to cut corners—and that’s affecting people who are seriously ill.



Predictably, NPR, itself a federally (and privately) funded creature, said the problem was a lack of funding, even titling the piece, “Patients Vulnerable When Cash‐​Strapped Scientists Cut Corners.”   
  
  
Allow NPR its sins, because what’s in the article is one key to a very disturbing trend, not just in biomedical science, but in “most disciplines and countries.” It seems that negative results are systematically disappearing from science. Those words appear in the title of a blockbuster 2012 article by University of Montreal’s Daniele Fanelli, more completely, “Negative Results are Disappearing from Most Disciplines and Countries.”   
  
  
Memo to NPR: Scientists are always “cash‐​strapped.” Just ask one. The reason is very simple, and can be illustrated by my area, climate science.   
  
  
There are actually very few people formally trained at the doctoral level in this field (yours truly being one of them). One reason was that, prior to the specter of anthropogenerated climate change, there wasn’t very much money from the federal government. It was about a $50 million a year operation, if that much. We didn’t have enough research dough.   
  
  
Now the federal outlay is $2.3 billion. Guess what: we’re _all_ climate scientists now. So ecologists, plant biologists, and even psychologists hitched their wagons to this gravy train. Today’s shocker: we don’t have enough research dough.   
  
  
What Harris found out about ALS really does apply in a Fanelli‐​like fashion. It seems that drugs that work fine on mice and rats flop miserably when tested on humans. It turns out that the animal studies were all pretty shoddy.   
  
  
Story Landis, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explained why. According to NPR, “There is no single answer, she says, but part of the explanation relates to a growing issue in biomedical science: the mad scramble for scarce research dollars.” She went on: “The field has become hypercompetitive,” and NPR added, “Many excellent grant proposals get turned down, simply because there’s not enough money to go around. So Landis says scientists are tempted to oversell weak results.”   




“Getting a grant requires that you have an exciting story to tell, that you have preliminary data and you have published”, she says. “In the rush, to be perfectly honest, to get a wonderful story out on the street in a journal, and preferably with some publicity to match, scientists can cut corners.”



According to a research paper published earlier this year, corner‐​cutting turned out to be the rule, rather than the exception, in animal studies of ALS.   
  
  
Stefano Bertuzzi, the executive director of the American Society for Cell Biology, says that’s because there is little incentive for scientists to take the time to go back and verify results from other labs;   




“You want to be the first one to show something”, he says—not the one to verify or dispute a finding, “because you won’t get a big prize for that.”



Landis noted that “ALS is not the only example of this type of _wishful science_ [emphasis added].” She found similar problems with other drugs for other diseases.   
  
  
It’s too bad that NPR didn’t then go to Montreal’s Fanelli, because they would have found that similar problems are infecting science everywhere, which is why Cato now has a Center for the Study of Science.   
  
  
_Coming up_ : I’ll be posting soon on what this does to science itself. Teaser: if there’s little incentive to publish negative results, whatever reigning paradigm is operating in a given field will be very resistant to change. As the Center for the Study of Science’s Richard Lindzen has observed, there has been a remarkable lack of paradigm substitution in overall science as research budgets ballooned. Ironically, the more we spend on science, the more science can be harmed.

From the University of Cape Town comes some bad news for global warming alarmists, Malaria deaths may soon be a thing of the past and their attempts to link such deaths to global warming will evaporate if this cure holds up in clinical trials. Of course it never did anyway: Another alarming climate myth bites the dust – mosquito borne malaria does NOT increase with temperature 
So if this is a real cure, no more cushy grants for Michael Mann to study Malaria and AGW then, see Mann’s 1.8 million Malaria grant – ‘where do we ask for a refund’? The most amazing part is the research is only 18 months old….so I expect it will be given an even more rigorous clinical review.  (h/t to WUWT reader Jason) – Anthony
African research identifies strong candidate for possible single-dose malaria cure
28 August 2012
A compound discovered by a UCT drug discovery programme has been selected by MMV for its potent activity against multiple points in parasite’s lifecycle







Big news: Prof Kelly Chibale (centre), here with Minister Naledi Pandor, speaks about the compound MMV390048 that he and international collaborators hope will lead to the development of a single-dose treatment for malaria.
Panel report: Dr Tim Wells, Prof Kelly Chibale, Minister Naledi Pandor, Dr Max Price and Dr Richard Gordon of the Technology Innovation Agency address the media at a press conference where they announced the development of the new compound.



A recently discovered compound – named MMV390048 – from the aminopyridine class not only has the potential to become part of a single-dose cure for all strains of malaria, but might also be able to block transmission of the parasite from person to person, according to a research collaboration involving the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), based in Switzerland, and the Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3-D) at UCT.
This was announced at UCT today.  
On the basis of initial results it was selected by MMV for further development – making it the first compound researched on African soil to enter preclinical development in partnership with MMV.
An African solution to save lives
Naledi Pandor, the Minister of Science & Technology, said: “This is a significant victory in the battle to alleviate the burden of disease in the subcontinent. Clearly the war on this disease is not yet won, but I am excited by the role that our excellent scientists have played in this milestone in finding a potential cure for malaria and possibly preventing its transmission. Congratulations to Professor Kelly Chibale and all involved. This is evidence of the world-class science being done in South Africa and the continent, and of the power of continental and international scientific collaboration in the multidisciplinary approaches that are essential in addressing the societal challenges of our time.”
Dr Max Price, the vice-chancellor of UCT, said: “H3-D was founded at UCT in 2010 for this very purpose: to develop African expertise towards solving the health problems that beset the developing world. We trust this clinical candidate is the first of many contributions Professor Chibale and his team will be making to the advancement of international medicine.”
H3-D identified a molecule, code named MMV390048, which was selected in July 2012 by MMV’s Expert Scientific Advisory Committee for further development. The promising new compound shows potent activity against multiple points in the malaria parasite’s lifecycle. This means it not only has the potential to become part of a single-dose cure for malaria but might also be able to block transmission of the parasite from person to person.
The aminopyridine series was initially identified by Griffith University scientists in Australia as part of MMV’s extensive malaria screening campaign of around 6 million compounds. A team of scientists from H3-D, led by UCT Professor Kelly Chibale, further scrutinised and explored the antimalarial potential of the series. With parasitological, pharmacological and contract chemistry support from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Switzerland), the Centre for Drug Candidate Optimization at Monash University (Australia) and Syngene (India) respectively, the H3-D team selected the most promising compounds from the series to be optimised and retested.
In just 18 months the team had identified and developed a candidate suitable for preclinical development.
Equipping the next generation of African scientists
“We are very excited that this promising compound, researched by African scientists, has been selected by MMV for further development,” said Chibale, the founder and director of H3-D. “This is truly a proud day for African science and African scientists. Our team is hopeful that the compound will emerge from rigorous testing as an extremely effective medicine for malaria – a disease that accounts for 24% of total child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. What is more, H3-D and MMV achieved MMV390048 as a clinical candidate in record time. In the process we have developed a unique model for successful technology platforms, and generic modern pharmaceutical industry expertise and skills, to discover drugs in potentially any disease area in Africa.”
Dr Tim Wells, MMV’s Chief Scientific Officer, said: “This is a great achievement and an excellent example of the quality of research that can be fostered in Africa. We look forward to seeing more exciting compounds emerge from Kelly’s team and are proud to be collaborating with H3-D; not only is it conducting excellent science today, but it is also providing world-class training for the next generation of African scientists.”
What is so unique and exciting about MMV390048

It is very potent: it displayed a complete cure of animals infected with malaria parasites in a single dose given orally, and thus has the potential to cure millions of people.
It is active against a wide panel of resistant strains of the malaria parasite.
Developing the drug has made possible the training of more than 10 local scientists and cemented a strong relationship with an international partner.
The clinical candidate is in line to enter clinical trials in late 2013.

As I wrote in [part one of this story](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/the-amazon-is-burning-pt-1-a-flaming-heap-of-bullshit/), every time some new environmental or climate change moral panic suddenly sweeps the legacy media and its whip-cracker, social media, it pays to immediately check to see which summit is scheduled to begin soon, or which left-wing politician is trying to distract attention. Part one covered the basic facts, which show that the ‘Amazon burning’ scare is just so much bullshit.



In part two, let’s look at how the whole lying, ignorant hysteria over the supposedly burning-to-the-ground Amazon is **all** about politics.



Firstly, there is the G7 summit: I’m sure you’ll be shocked, **shocked** , to learn that the “Amazon is burning” frenzy was triggered by the politically-troubled French leader, Emmanuel Macron. As it so happens, Macron is right in the midst of trade negotiations with Brazil’s Jair Bolsanaro. Bolsanaro is, of course, an evil right-winger, the “South American Trump”. The left really, **really** don’t like Bolsanaro: he was stabbed almost to death, even before he was elected.



The smoke should be clearing already.



[Bolsanaro’s] Funding cuts have created plenty of enemies.



Many people have a reason to want Bolsonaro to look bad: In May Bolsonaro withdrew an offer to host a United Nations Latin America and Caribbean climate week. In the same week, the president fired self-confessed “militant environmentalist” Alfredo Sirkis, then-leader of The Brazil Forum for Climate Change. He also declared a 30 percent funding cut to maintenance costs of Brazil’s state-owned universities. Three weeks ago, Brazil’s INPE Space director was sacked. The INPE have been the source of the dire data used in some media stories. But Bolsonaro said the data was “not consistent with reality”, accused the head of the INPE of “lies” and working for an NGO.



On the 13th August Germany announced plans to withdraw some €35 million due to the country’s lack of commitment to curbing deforestation . On August 15, Norway suspended donations too […] Spot the coincidence.



The twitter firestorm is amplified just when the UN and big-government fans could use a negotiation weapon […] International leaders are transparently exploiting the hype:



“France and Ireland say they will not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nations unless Brazil does more to fight fires in the Amazon. French leader Emmanuel Macron said President Jair Bolsonaro had lied to him about his stance on climate change.” [BBC News]



The lyin’ legacy media are about as honest and truthful as the politicians.



Some journalists appear to be running off the twitter feed. But others seem to be carefully crafting their stories to highlight irrelevant, cherry-picked half truths.



  
The legacy media aren’t even **trying** to hide their bias. In fact, the _Columbia Journalism Review_ , “intellectual leader…the most respected voice on press criticism, [which] shapes the ideas that make media leaders and journalists smarter about their work”, is openly touting the legacy media narrative.



 **CJR is emailing journalists around the world, ordering them to fall in line.**



Our ask of you is simple: commit to a week of focused climate coverage this September. We are organizing news outlets across the US and abroad—online and print, TV and audio, large and small—to run seven days of climate stories from September 16 through the climate summit UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres hosts in New York September 23.



Could they be **any** more obvious?



In his bestselling _State of Fear_ , Michael Crichton writes that “Politicians need fear to control the population […] the media need scare stories to capture an audience […] this is the way modern society works – by the constant creation of fear”.



In Crichton’s novel, a shadowy cabal of e-NGOs and environmental terrorists conspire to engineer a series of devastating ‘natural’ disasters in order to grab attention for their climate scare campaign. But, with the “Amazon is burning” bonfire of bullshit, the left-media elite aren’t even **bothering** to hide what they’re up to any more.

"The opening of the Oscar-winning film The Big Short, a comedy-drama on the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, begins with a famous quote: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” This phrase captures one of the main reasons why the US housing bubble popped in 2008, triggering the worst economic recession since the 1930s. The movie portrays an eccentric hedge fund manager discussing the idea of betting against subprime mortgage bonds. The investment bankers, at first, reply politely: “Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don’t pay mortgages. That’s never happened in history.” But it happened. And as a consequence, many people worldwide have suffered severely, and the enduring effects still haunt us, politically and economically, even a decade later. In a new paper published in Climate Policy, we argue that a similar tragic “debt crisis” could unfold for climate change. The “debt” would be measured in excess carbon emissions, which will keep accumulating until we reach net-zero. In this scenario, the bankers are those who assume that the debt will be paid back by removing carbon from the atmosphere.  But such a bet will be necessary if we recklessly embark on the strategy of reducing emissions slowly and removing carbon later, while in the meantime using speculative technology to block out heat from the sun. Among climate scientists and policy analysts, this is the so-called temperature “overshoot and peak-shaving” scenario. In December 2015, the world adopted the Paris Agreement and pledged to limit global temperature rise well below 2℃ – if not 1.5℃ – above pre-industrial levels. Despite that, global CO₂ emissions continue to rise. The slow and uneven pace of global emissions reductions is increasing the likelihood of “overshoot” scenarios, in which warming will temporarily exceed 1.5 or 2°C, but will later fall to the target temperature through the large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies. These remove CO₂ from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees or scrubbing it through chemical filters and burying it deep underground. But the world would still need to adapt to the impacts of increased warming during the overshooting period. Because of this concern, the idea of so-called “peak-shaving” has also emerged among some scientists who want to avoid such an overshoot by temporarily using solar geoengineering. Solar geoengineering means dimming sunlight itself. In theory, the Earth could be cooled very quickly by, for example, spraying sulphate aerosols in the upper atmosphere. The concept of an “overshoot and peak-shaving” scenario is therefore based on the temporary use of solar geoengineering, combined with large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies. In this scenario, the two technologies are in a mutually dependent relationship – solar geoengineering is used to keep the temperature down for the time being, while negative emissions technologies are used to reduce atmospheric CO₂ to the point where solar geoengineering is no longer needed.  But this assumed reciprocity may not work as intended. Here, the notion of debt is useful. As the sociologist Lisa Adkins suggests, the logic of debt rests on a promise to pay (back) in the future. In this sense, both overshooting and peak-shaving can be seen as acts of “borrowing” or “creating debt”. Overshooting avoids reducing carbon emissions today by effectively borrowing emissions from the future (creating “emissions debt”), with a promise to pay back that debt later through negative emissions technologies. Peak-shaving is borrowing global temperature (creating “temperature debt”) through the temporary use of solar geoengineering to cancel excess warming until the point when no further borrowing, of either sort, is needed. In such an outcome the world will take on a double debt: “emissions debt” and “temperature debt”. The fact of being indebted may not sound so bad. (Almost everyone has a debt of some kind in their everyday life, right?) But the key question is: can we duly pay off this “climate debt”? How credible is the promise? Here, the analogy with housing loans is most useful for properly rating the riskiness of such debt repayment. Given that overshoot allows slow rates of emissions reductions by “promising” that delays can be compensated later through carbon removal, this looks a bit like borrowing an adjustable-rate subprime mortgage loan. Peak-shaving, on the other hand, is more like borrowing additional loans for “home improvement”, which maintains house values – (keeps global temperature constant during the overshooting period).  Since most negative emissions technologies are still speculative or under development, overshoot should be rated like a subprime loan with a high risk of default. Just as American homeowners weren’t able to keep paying their mortgages after all, so negative emissions technologies may never be an effective enough way to take carbon out of the atmosphere. This doesn’t sound like a secure, feasible investment. The failure to keep the overshoot promise of later repayment would lead to endless peak-shaving. Solar geoengineering would become an ongoing necessity – an unpayable massive “climate debt” accumulating year-by-year. Concerns over crossing so-called “tipping points” – paving the way toward a “hothouse Earth” – may push some people towards accepting overshooting and peak-shaving. But because this is a speculative scenario, it matters how we frame it.  Some scientists say that solar geoengineering is like a drug to lower high-blood pressure – an overdose is harmful, but a “well-chosen” and limited dose can lower your risks, helping you have a healthier life. They suggest that solar geoengineering is not a substitute for cutting emissions but a supplement for containing global temperature increases. But this works only if negative emissions technologies are rolled out very swiftly on a massive scale.

      Blocking out the sun won't fix climate change – but it could buy us time


 The housing loans analogy sheds light on an important assumption that is implicitly built into such a scenario, namely that overshooting is simply like borrowing money (for example, a mortgage) and that people pay back mortgages. This was also the unquestioned assumption in the run up to the US housing market crisis and it created the systemic failure to notice the growing risk of the bubble bursting. We shouldn’t fool ourselves into believing that a similar “debt crisis” will not happen for managing the risk of climate change. Beware the dubious promises of “overshoot and peak-shaving” technologies – they may well turn out to be risky subprime loans. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**The mass testing of university students for Covid-19, so they can go home for the Christmas break, has started in Canterbury.**
Those testing negative will be able to use the ""travel window"" between 3 and 9 December.
Two tests must be taken 72 hours apart.
""We're trying to ensure the safety of students returning to their families and not presenting a risk to them"" said Simon Gwynne of Canterbury Christchurch University.
The testing centre set up at the university will be open from 10:00 to 18:00 GMT every day until 8 December, with 900 students booked in on the first day.
Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 must isolate for 10 days, with a community buddy system making sure they are looked after.
But Becky Thomson, president of the Canterbury Christchurch Students' Union, says some might not take advantage of the testing.
""A lot of students would have stayed until 20, 21 December to get the maximum out of study. A lot are thinking of leaving later outside the window because of study restrictions, so they don't know whether or not to get it""."
"After years of depressing images of huge fields strewn with abandoned tents and rubbish in the aftermath of music festivals, it was heartening to hear Glastonbury Festival organisers claim that 99% of festival-goers’ tents were picked up after the festival. For a festival of 200,000 people this is a huge achievement. But really it should be normal. Hopefully this bodes well for future years, because the Association of Independent Festivals estimates that a quarter of a million so called “single-use” tents are abandoned at music festivals across the UK each year. There is a popular belief that most tents left behind after festivals are collected and sold by charities or sent to good causes. But this is wishful thinking: most of it end up in landfill. The practical and cost overheads for festival organisers and charities of collecting thousands of tents are just too much. All the elements of the tents – pegs, poles, sheets and bags – need to be present, undamaged, and the tent sufficiently clean and functional to be reused.  After a festival, security typically flatten those tents still standing to insure no one has been left behind, or even – as this year – to discover whether anyone has died during the event. This makes it harder to easily identify the tents that are potentially reusable in a field full of them. It’s also likely they’ll be damaged in the process. It’s been reported that tents make up 17% of waste from UK festivals that ends up in landfill. Cheap tents are often made out of polyester or nylon with a coating of silicone or acrylic polyurethane, with poles made of carbon fibre and pegs made of aluminium. Synthetic fibres such as nylon and polyester are polymers derived from fossil fuels and generally do not biodegrade. Polymers have exceptionally high stability and durability, which is precisely why such materials are so popular and so suitable for making tents. The concentration of plastic waste in landfills results in the release of contaminants into the environment. While well-regulated landfills minimise the impact on the surrounding environment, there are still long-term contamination risks to the soil and groundwater. As it is, the UK is fast running out of landfill capacity – a recent report estimated that England has less than seven years capacity for non-hazardous landfill. Even before accounting for disposal, tents take a fair amount of energy to make. Based on estimations by consultancy Julie’s Bicycle, the manufacture of typical 3.5kg tent emits the equivalent of as much as 25kg of carbon dioxide, and contains the equivalent of around 8,750 straws or 250 pint cups of plastic. This is about the same amount of CO2 emitted by a car driving 100 miles – without even taking into account the additional energy it takes transport the tent to shops, or to transport it to landfill. Today, tents and pegs made out of biodegradable materials such as cardboard and biodegradable plastics are available. But these products are sometimes less portable, less resilient to the deluges so common at British festivals, and may sometimes take years to actually biodegrade – especially in tightly packed landfill sites with limited oxygen supply. At the time of writing, Argos, Aldi, Tesco and Halfords all sell tents for £20 or less – hardly a major investment – especially when seen against the price of festival tickets in the UK that are often around £200. Outdoor equipment – and tents in particular – are often produced in sweatshop conditions. Standing in a sunny field it is easy to forget the inhumane working and living conditions of the workers half a world away that have toiled to make these tents. Regardless of what it’s made of, using a tent repeatedly is more environmentally friendly than one discarded after a single use. By dumping their tents, festival-goers help normalise this type of wasteful behaviour. People are social animals that tend to copy their flock, so festival-goers observing others leaving tents behind are much more likely to leave their own. On the other hand, a clean field of the sort captured by Emily Eavis’s drone in the image above should help nudge even tired festival-goers to take home the equipment they brought with them. The images of abandoned tents are more than just a comment on the environmental and ethical impacts of the festival itself. They are a visually dramatic symbol of our throwaway culture – just as images of clean fields at Glastonbury are a refreshing vision of hope for what could be."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday Germany’s flagship political daily, the renowned Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), which has long been a disciple of global warming religion (woeful deficits in climate sciences have long been a problem of the German mainstream media) raised a few eyebrows in daring to feature the global warming-blasphemous chart that no German was ever supposed to see.

FAZ features John Christy’s headline making chart. Chart source: Prof. John Christy, Daily Mail.
This leads us to believe that perhaps even the FAZ is tiring just a bit of the UN climate circuses that come to town every year. The chart slide show presented today by the FAZ is titled: Curvy Climate Change – The Charts of the Apocalypse. The slide show features 7 charts which often get used in the climate debate to communicate the messages of climate change to the public. Charts 2 – 6 are alarmist, but the final one douses ice water on the whole global warming meme.
The online FAZ describes chart 7, John Christy’s comparison of models vs observations featured by the online Daily Mail in March as the chart that “makes the hearts of skeptics beat faster” and that “the Daily Mail article resulted in a furor” and that “no article was distributed so much in the Internet as this one was“.

To be fair, the FAZ says that the Mail’s headline claims that global warming was exaggerated were “in the end untenable“. I guess no one has told the FAZ that there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years.
In Chart 2, which shows world fossil fuel consumption, The FAZ writes that this “hardly made an impression on host country Poland“.
Chart 3 shows the CO2 emissions scenarios for the future and that global emissions are even currently tracking over the upper expectations. Chart 4 shows Hansen’s danger zone chart, where 250 ppm is (arbitrarily) selected as the start of danger. One gets the impression that CO2 levels below 350 will yield only nice and tame weather, which we know is lots of BS because storms were just as bad if not worse in the 1950s and earlier.
Chart 5 features the “Song of a warming world“, which also can be viewed as a mere gimmick to promote fear over a fictional climate disaster. Higher temperatures could also be regarded as positive and so the music could made to be more pleasant as temps rise.
Finally, Chart 6 featured by the FAZ is about Arctic sea ice. Much to their credit the FAZ used one that included the year 2013 and commented: “What can’t be seen on the chart, because what is happening independently in the south pole is: in 2013 there was more sea ice than ever was recorded in 30 years at the Antarctic.”

Saudi Production Profile
Guest post by David Archibald
World conventional oil production peaked in 2005 and has been on a plateau at about that level ever since. This graph suggests that the market changed from inherent over-supply to inherent tightness in June 2004:

Figure 1: World Oil Production and Oil Price 1994 – 2011
World conventional oil production will at some stage tip over into decline. That may be this year or it may be as late as 2015. The decline in US production began over four decades ago in 1970, as predicted by King Hubbert in 1956.
The next big one to tip over into decline will be Saudi Arabia. In determining what that will look like and its consequences, the first thing to do is a logistic decline plot of Saudi production history. Figure 2 shows the result:


Figure 2: Saudi Arabia Logistic Decline Plot
Figure 2 shows that the Saudis have produced about half of their ultimate recoverable reserves. When half of a nation’s oil has been depleted, production rate decline is inexorable. From this plot, total ultimate recoverable reserves for Saudi Arabia are estimated to be 275 billion barrels. From this plot, Saudi Arabia is on the cusp of decline. So what will that decline look like?

Figure 3: Saudi Arabia Conceptual Crude, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids Forecast
This figure was produced by Euan Mearns in 2008. The red volume on the bottom right is the Ghawar Field and the green is the rest of the heritage super giants. The steep fall in projected Ghawar production from about 2012 would be due to an expectation that the field is watering out on its crest as shown in this figure:

Figure 4: Two cross sections of a reservoir simulation of the northern part of the ‘Ain Dar region of the Ghawar Field
Figure 4 shows the progressive displacement of oil by water over the sixty years from 1940 to 2004. SW is water saturation. The reds are high oil saturation and the green shows where oil saturation is now down to about 50%. To recover further oil from the green areas requires enhanced oil recovery (EOR) tehniques such as carbon dioxide injection.

Figure 5: Regional cross section through the Ghawar Field
This figure is from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The Ghawar Field is developed from a north-south trending horst block. It is 174 miles long by 16 miles wide. The producing horizon is the Arab D reservoir at about 7,000 feet.

Figure 6: Saudi Arabia Production Profile 1938 – 2040
From the foregoing, Figure 6 shows the production profile generated for Saudi Arabia. The production decline is 3% per annum which amounts to about 300,000 bopd per annum from the current level. The world can cope with that, but will the Saudis?

Figure 7: Saudi Arabia Population 1960 – 2040
Back in 1960, there were only about 4 million Saudis, now there are 27 million with population growth at 2.4% per annum compound. So, if the current trend continues, there will be 50 million of them by 2040. With population rising at 2.4% per annum and production falling at 3% per annum, we are starting with a net 5.4% per annum contraction in per capital oil production. The effect of that is captured by Figure 8 following.

Figure 8: Saudi Arabia cash available per capita
The forecast in Figure 8 is based on the oil price running up to $200 per barrel by 2018 and then plateauing at that level. The Saudi Govt increased social welfare payments in response to the Arab Spring. As a consequence, their budget is just about break even at the current oil price. If social outlays aren’t increased further, they pontentially have a lot of cash to play with for the next eight years or so, though they are also propping up Yemen with whom they share a land border. The crunch point is reached about 2026 when income falls below constant per capita outlays. As a society and as individuals, Saudis will then find their standard of living falling by 7% per annum compound. None shall weep for them.

When my better half watched a documentary on solar flare, which is a sudden unpredictable flash of increased brightness on the sun, we talked about the possible correlation between the sun’s variability and global warming. It just makes sense.



We are curious people but not scientists, and Wikipedia says even the most powerful solar flares are barely detectable in the total solar irradiance. So could the sun’s variability actually affect global warming?



This month, two independent Irish scientists, Ronan and Michael Connelly, along with Willie Soon from Harvard, submitted their research “Re-evaluating the role of solar variability on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since the 19th century” to Earth Science Reviews. [Christopher Monckton](https://www.google.com/search?q=christopher+monkton&oq=christopher+monkton&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3191j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) introduces their findings in this video. 



Obviously global warming scientists have examined solar variability before. This new research uses the same dataset but re-examines the solar variability factor. 



“Although our new composite implies different trends from previous estimates, we note that it is compatible with Northern Hemisphere temperature trends derived from (a) sea surface temperatures; (b) glacier length records; (c) tree ring widths. 



**However, the recent multi model means of the CMIP5 Global Climate Model hindcasts failed to adequately reproduce the temperature trends implied by our composite, even when they included both “anthropogenic and natural forcings”.**



  
_See note below for a definition of “forcings”._ The CMIP5 is the global climate database and model the IPCC uses for its global warming projections. It underpins the Paris Accord that costs NZ taxpayers $1.4B a year and is the basis of subsequent global warming studies.



Science Direct calls CMIP5 a “heterogenous dataset” because “[virtually all climate modelling teams in the world contributed to this work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/cmip).” 



“The CMIP5 database allows access to the variables output from each individual model. The outputs are generally available as time series, with various time steps, including daily, monthly, and yearly time steps; from 2006 to 2100 ( ** _some models even propose outputs projections up to 2300).”_**



  
It’s a very, very big deal for Connelly and Soon to diss the CMIP5 model, and they arrived at their conclusion only after reviewing years of data and after comparing previous studies to their own findings.



“[…] we first review t ** _he debate over solar variability._** We summarize the points of general agreement between most groups and the aspects which still remain controversial. 



We discuss possible future research which may help resolve the controversy of these aspects. Then, in order to account for the problem of urbanization bias, we compile a new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends since 1881, using records from predominantly rural stations in the monthly Global Historical Climatology Network dataset.



Like previous weather station-based estimates, our new estimate suggests that surface air temperatures warmed during the 1880s-1940s and 1980s-2000s.



 ** _However, this new estimate suggests these two warming periods were separated by a pronounced cooling period during the 1950s-1970s and that the relative warmth of the mid-20th century warm period was comparable to the recent warm period.”_**



Their weather station-based temperature trend estimate was consistent with independent estimates of Northern Hemisphere Sea Surface Temperature (SST) trends, as were temperature proxy-based estimates derived from glacier length records and from tree ring widths. 



“ ** _However, the multi-model means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model hindcasts were unable to adequately reproduce the new estimate_** – although the modelling of certain volcanic eruptions did seem to be reasonably well reproduced.”



Their conclusion is the knife to the heart of the IPCC man-made global warming argument. 



“We have constructed a new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends derived from mostly rural stations – thereby minimizing the problems introduced to previous estimates by urbanization bias. 



Similar to previous estimates, our composite implies warming trends during the periods 1880s-1940s and 1980s-2000s.



However, this new estimate implies a more pronounced cooling trend during the 1950s-1970s. 



As a result, the relative warmth of the mid-20th century warm period is comparable to the recent warm period ** _– a different conclusion to previous estimates._**



One reason why the hindcasts might have failed to accurately reproduce the temperature trends is that **_the solar forcings they used all implied relatively little solar variability._**



 ** _However, in this paper, we carried out a detailed review of the debate over solar variability, and revealed that considerable uncertainty remains over exactly how the Total Solar Irradiance has varied since the 19th century._**



**_When we compared our new composite to one of the high solar variability reconstructions of Total Solar Irradiance which was not considered by the CMIP5 hindcasts (i.e., the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction), we found a remarkably close fit._**



If the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction and our new Northern Hemisphere temperature trend estimates are accurate, then it seems that **_most of the temperature trends since at least 1881 can be explained in terms of solar variability, with atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations providing at most a minor contribution._**



 ** _This contradicts the claim by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that most of the temperature trends since the 1950s are due to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Bindoff et al., 2013).”_**



If substantiated, this research blows the man-made global warming theory (anthropogenic forcing) right out of the water. **This is huge.** The effect for us is huge. We can abandon the politically and financially motivated Paris Accord and put the man-made climate change myth where it belongs – in the fairy tale section of school libraries. Solar variability is the knife through the heart of man-made global warming.



 _[Note:](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-forcing) “Forcings” are climate change drivers, natural and man-made energy reflected from the earth back into the atmosphere. “Natural climate drivers include changes in the sun’s energy output, regular changes in Earth’s orbital cycle, and large volcanic eruptions that put light-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere. Human-caused, or anthropogenic climate drivers include emissions of heat-trapping gases (also known as greenhouse gases) and changes in land use that make land reflect more or less sunlight energy.“_

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere I am not talking about man, as in mankind, but men, i.e. males.
In the German state of Bavaria, children of the advanced secondary schools, aged 13-14, are required to take a reading comprehension test. The text used to do this is a report about climate change titled: “Ist der Klimawandel ein Mann?” (Is Climate Change A Man?)” Hat-tip German blog site info.kopp-verlag.de. 
The main message of the text is that men, with their macho lifestyles, produce far more CO2 than women and thus the planet is suffering because of it. The text cites scientific studies (from women) and presents claims made by the studies as fact.
The text begins:
Is climate change a man?
Steaks and cars, both as big as possible. That is – precisely typical male. ‘Thus climate change is a man.’ This is how provocatively Ines Weller, a professor in Bremen, formulated her arguments: On average men eat more meat and drive swankier, fuel guzzling cars, preferably fast. In the end, both increase the global emission of CO2. What’s worse, says Weller, is that men often do not want to change their behavior. Therefore the contribute more to global climate change than women. Women eat more fruit and vegetables and drive mostly small, fuel-saving cars and they drive less kilometers each year. They use, Weller says, public transportation considerably more often.”
That’s just the first introductory paragraph. Right from the start children here learn that men are worse for the environment, are more wasteful, and they are unwilling to change. It gets worse. The text continues:
Gotelind Alber, environmental expert and physicist, confirms the Bremen study almost completely. In addition one could say that women, even though they contribute less to climate change, are often hit harder by its impacts. This is especially true for women in poorer countries, where they are busy with providing for the family. And that will become increasingly more difficult as environmental conditions become more acute.”
Not only are men being made responsible for climate change, but they are also getting blamed for the hardships women in poor countries have to endure.
Men drive bigger cars
The text then asks just how much is the contribution to climate change made by men and women. This is a difficult question to answer, the text says. This is why the researchers studied single-person households. The text provides some results:
On average male single households produce more CO2 than female single households. In Sweden, for example, its a plus of 30%. Namely Swedish men almost always drive the bigger car. That was the case for more or less every European country, said Alber.”
Men eat more climate-killing meat
The German children learn from the text that men’s eating habits are also posing a big problem for the climate and environment.

And how does it look with nutrition? Studies conducted by an Austrian environment institute have shown that more than 20% of global CO2 emissions come from the production and transport of foodstuffs. The biggest share here is clearly from the production of meat. Studies further show that men eat far more meat than women. The ‘beef calculation’ made by climate experts yields: The production of one kilogram of steak alone causes 36.4 kilograms of CO2. Thus also in this area men appear to be the climate violators.”
The fourth paragraph of the text serves as a fig leaf in an attempt to hide the text’s obvious attack on the male gender, adding that women are producing more CO2 in their consumption of milk products, cosmetics and clothing. But in total, men are much worse.
The text ends with:
Moreover: women think differently than men; they tend to be more open to doing something for the overall public good. Women, who are more often there for the family than men, are used to thinking of others,’ says Alber. Men on the other hand are environmentally conscious when it does not cost anything.”
Clearly the text conveys that men are less desirable than women, and that they are more to blame for the world’s ills. But this is not to say that the world would be a better place without men. The real message is: “The world would be a far better place if women ran it. Men would be better serving as their slaves. 🙂  The environmental movement is not a war on humanity – it’s a war on men.
German blog sites react to the text
Gerhard Wisnewski of Kopp online here writes:
The indoctrination in German schools is already well advanced and no longer even holds back with with-hunting propaganda. […] here kids are learning that the world would be much better without men. […] this is all about pure gender fascism. […] Our state ‘educational institutes’ don’t hold back in denouncing and defaming an entire half of the population.”
Dr. habil. Heike Diefenbach and Michael Klein here:
The blatant method in which hate is being funneled to German schoolchildren age 13-14, the perfidious manner in which distrust is being generated between the genders among the youth at German schools where they are being told: You as a male person are faulty, but you have the chance to purify yourself and to become unmanly, no longer borders on indoctrination. It goes far beyond that and reminds us more of the education camps where Nicolae Ceaușescu drilled his body guards. It reminds us of the initiation rites that Heinrich Himmler conducted in his dream palace Wewelsburg. […] This has absolutely nothing to do with the educating and upbringing the youth to be independent and critical members of their societies.”
Diefenbach and Klein add that this type of indoctrination is a “primitive form of manipulation and conditioning of the youth.”
Western education system hostile to males
Years ago it seemed that Germany’s advanced secondary education (Gymnasium) was about 50/50 male-female. Today I can’t help but notice that this has shifted markedly. In my son’s and daughter’s class it was more like two thirds girls and only one third boys. I don’t know what the situation is like in other European countries. It just seems that education system is becoming increasingly hostile to males. In the USA, if I’m not mistaken, more women are completing higher education than men.
So men, get back to the books and do your homework. Otherwise you may wake up one day soon finding yourself in shackles, in the servitude of women. Heck, I know plenty of men who today are perfectly content with that! 🙂

"Last month the Dutch government announced a bold set of climate policies designed to reduce annual carbon emissions by nearly 10 megatons, comparable to the yearly output of Latvia. Several new coal power plants are to be closed or run at minimum capacity, a €3bn spending package will subsidise renewable energy projects and home refits, and there are a slew of smaller policy tweaks, for example on livestock numbers, reforestation and lowering the national speed limit.  The middle of a public health crisis may seem like a strange time to make new climate commitments, but the Dutch government had little choice. A court case brought by environmental groups in 2014 and upheld by the supreme court last year forced the government to act to reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020 at the latest. It is climate action under extreme duress. There are more than 1,500 climate lawsuits either complete or ongoing in the world, including similar cases in Ireland and Norway, but this is by far the most successful to date. Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, says the Dutch case is the “strongest climate change decision ever issued by a court” and the only one that has forced government policy. It has big implications not only for climate law but also for governments, most of whose climate policies are years behind their ambitious pledges. Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN framework convention on climate change, called it “a test case for very rapid emission reductions” that other nations should watch closely. The Dutch government has opted for a crash programme, choosing policies that should mean it hits the target in the eight months remaining in 2020. But it didn’t have to be this way. Marjan Minnesma, the head of the Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge, says the policies are “a great victory for the rule of law” but points out that Urgenda won its initial case in a district court in The Hague in June 2015. The 2020 target was set at that time and could have been reached gradually, but the government twice tied the case up in appeals, eventually losing in the supreme court in December last year. “It took a long time to step up – five years of not embracing the judgment,” says Matt Siennot, an MP with Democrats 66. An adviser to the Dutch government says the ruling coalition at the time of the original ruling – between the centrist People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the centre-left Labour party – was split on whether to take action and afraid that accepting the decision would open the way to further legal challenges. So they let it languish. “They would say they worked on it, but little was done” he said. Their fears about the courts were ultimately correct: the Netherlands is now a proving ground for environmental lawsuits. A similar case to cap nitrogen pollution was won in 2018, and one of the lawyers from the Urgenda case has partnered with Friends of the Earth to sue Shell, which is headquartered in The Hague. After the supreme court decision, Minnesma was invited to meet government ministers to present potential carbon reduction policies, and she found their reticence had melted away. “A year ago they wouldn’t have listened to any of that, but suddenly they were all writing it down,” she says. What she presented was a green wishlist sourced from more than 800 NGOs and institutions – everything from housing associations with ambitious retrofitting strategies to animal rights groups pushing a meat tax and a national meat-free day. “We are bringing these ideas from a wide range of Dutch society. We would say: if you want a broad group to accept it, these are the right things. I got the sense they were willing to listen.” Paul van der Zanden, a spokesperson for the economics and climate ministry, says: “Finding social support was important for these 2020 climate goals. Urgenda gave a great help in the search for climate measures that citizens can take themselves.” Many of the ideas would have been sidelined for years without the push provided by the court decision. Jan Willem Erisman, a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam who works on emissions in agriculture and who contributed proposals to Urgenda, says: “The lawsuits are almost needed for the work to be considered by the government. Otherwise economic concerns get in the way, targets are set, we don’t reach them, and then new targets get set.” The Dutch climate agreement presented in the summer of 2019 was the product of cooperation between industry, the energy sector, unions, environmental groups and citizen groups. The Dutch government believes public and social support are essential for a successful climate policy, and it helps citizens to take climate measures themselves. For example, it provides financial support for lowering households’ energy consumption.  Ultimately, the government settled on the easiest option for the bulk of the emissions reductions. One coal-fired power plant will be closed outright, and two others built in 2016 will run at a minimal level. This alone will save 5-7.5mt of emissions. But several more public-facing measures from the Urgenda list were selected as well. There will be €2bn for renewable energy subsidies, much of it for rooftop solar, and buybacks of inefficient household appliances. Housing associations will receive much of a €300m pot for retrofitting. “So far there really hasn’t been much of an attempt to involve people in policies to slow climate change,” says Rebecca Willis, an environmental policy researcher at Lancaster University. “Governments often prioritise policies that don’t impact directly on people’s lives, like switching to renewable energy. But the changes now needed, from switching to electric vehicles and public transport to eating less meat, will affect people’s lives, and it’s vital to work with people to involve them.” Perhaps surprisingly, none of the Dutch measures have provoked much of a pushback yet. The Netherlands is no stranger to the climate culture war. The speed limit change from 130km/h to 100km/h – a measure that has already been brought in and is expected to save half a megaton of carbon per year – was mocked as “nonsense” by the far-right MP Geert Wilders and criticised by motoring lobbyists, but the much larger and more expensive parts of the package have passed relatively quietly. The government may have the coronavirus crisis to thank for that. Compared with the spending programmes being rolled out in response to the pandemic, a climate programme that would be huge any other year now seems slight and has not attracted much notice. Remco De Boer, an energy analyst, says: “There’s so much else happening. And they’re spending money. KLM [the Dutch airline] has just been rescued [for €4bn].” He says measures such as renewables subsidies and home upgrades also fit with the desire for economic stimulus. The crisis has also provided the government with a bit of wiggle room in delivering the policies. Emissions for 2020 will be much reduced with so much economic activity suspended. Pieter Boot, the head of climate at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, estimates that even a short lockdown could knock more than 5mt off the yearly total. But Minnesma says that even if emissions get a one-time reprieve, the measures need to be permanent. The court verdict will be just as valid next year and every year going forward. “We still have the rule of law,” she says, “and we have shown using the law as an instrument of change is possible.” • This article was amended on 4 May 2020. An earlier version misdescribed Democrats 66 as “an opposition party”."

BFD readers no doubt belong to that vast majority of happy folk, greatly to be envied, who neither know nor care who Elizabeth Farrelly is. So I must apologise for bursting your bubbles of blissful ignorance.



If there was a pictorial calendar of watermelons, Farrelly would be its cover girl. Her simpering, head-tilted smirk is the epitome of complacent leftist ignorance. From the rarified confines of inner Sydney, architecture critic (for such is the only trade she is actually qualified for) Farrelly deigns to grace the rest of us with her views on everything from inconvenient tradesmen (she abuses at them, should they dare let their work intrude on her cycling progress) to [how to manage the nation’s farms](https://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/forgiving-land-clearers-because-of-drought-is-like-comforting-a-fat-child-with-chocolate-20190808-p52f64.html).



As farmer Tom Marland (with dual degrees in environmental management and law) says:



One thing I enjoy is being lectured to by urban media on how farmers should manage their land and environment.



[Elizabeth Farrelly] is your typical modern day urban environmental weekend warrior. She was late getting her article in because she was out planting trees. She has planted 70 this year!



That’s nothing – the rumour is that she only took **one** overseas holiday this year. Take that, greenhouse gases!



The reality is that the net gain of those trees would be wiped out by one of her commutes to work and wouldn’t even cover the food miles for the imported coffee beans at her favourite coffee shop. But don’t let facts get in the way of a good hack job.



After planting a few trees, she felt qualified to stray from her specialisation as an “architecture critic” to share with us her extensive knowledge of vegetation management and the benefits of trees she found in a google search.



I hate to play one-upmanship but my family manages somewhere around 10 million trees on our freehold country plus another 10 million in our national park. We didn’t plant any of them – they just grow naturally – in the millions…I rarely get the time to “hug” my trees unless I’ve been wiped off my horse by one of them chasing cattle. But I understand that to maintain a healthy forest you have to “manage it”. Whether by fire, axe or chain it needs to be selectively cared for to ensure it’s not choked out by woody weeds, lantana and noxious weeds. You can’t just “lock it up” other wise a bushfire will eventually come along and destroy the lot.



Michael Crichton rams home the same point in his excellent _State of Fear_ : the environmentalist fantasy of nature’s “balance” is just that – a fantasy. The delusion of “environmentalists” who live as far from the natural environment as it’s possible to be. The Australian landscape has been managed for the benefit of humans for tens of thousands of years.



Like most urban environmentalists, the article starts off by painting all farmers as environmental vandals who are roaming around the bush on bulldozers chanting “Kill more trees, cut them off at the knees, kill more trees.” I’m not offended by that statement – it just demonstrates the ignorance of someone who has no idea what they are talking about…I’m not sure if she has actually read the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. I have and it is hardly a puff piece. NSW vegetation laws are overly officious, technically confusing and inconsistent with extensive enforcement powers and heavy penalties.



Ask the farmer from Garah who stick raked previously cultivated wheat paddocks and was fined $350,000 for “clearing” 500 hectares of “native vegetation” regrowth about how “soft” NSW vegetation laws are.



But an “environmentalist” from the concrete jungle of inner Sydney thinks she knows better.



Sydney…[doesn’t] have to worry about vegetation management laws – the remaining vegetation are in parks or in pot plants.



It’s easy to moralise about vegetation management when it is someone’s problem and livelihood.



It’s easy to point the finger when someone else is picking up the tab.



It’s easy to have an opinion when the cost of that opinion is nil. That accordingly is also its value…I wonder if the author actually had to pay a farmer for the vegetation on their land rather than just take it for free whether she would be so eager to pontificate about the virtues of vegetation.



I doubt it.

Ugly reality has dashed the high hopes of the “Arab Spring.” Although the dream of democratic reform lives on, only Tunisia appears on course. In Egypt, the fall of Hosni Mubarak has encouraged religious intolerance and persecution, especially against the Coptic Christian community.



Once a great civilization, Egypt long ago turned into an impoverished backwater. Only a large population and strategic location today deliver geopolitical importance. Hosni Mubarak ruled for three decades, but under him the Egyptian people enjoyed neither prosperity nor liberty. In fact, Mubarak was exhibit A for America’s foreign policy conundrum: stability or democracy? He held the Muslim Brotherhood in check, maintained a cold peace with Israel, and kept the Suez Canal open. For that he was richly rewarded with tens of billions in “foreign aid,” which he used to build an authoritarian kleptocracy — one that treated the needs of most Egyptians as an afterthought. Washington occasionally pushed for reform, but never too hard, lest stability be sacrificed.



Mubarak counted among his victims the Coptic Christians, who make up around ten percent of the population. They predate Islam, but today are a disadvantaged and increasingly threatened minority. Rather like Saddam Hussein and the Assad family, Mubarak seemingly cared little for religion. However, he left more room for Islamic extremists to act and compete for political support by victimizing religious minorities.



While the “government does not actively persecute or repress Christians, a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity,” noted Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty in Egypt “poor.” State added that Christians and Baha’is faced “personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship.”



Moreover, the regime “sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed” those “whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.” Government‐​controlled media and government‐​funded mosques encourage violence. The authorities do little to stop the kidnapping of young Coptic girls, who then are forced to marry Muslims.



Converts are at particular risk. Despite some recent progress, the government traditionally refused to provide new identity documents to converts as well as Baha’is. Worse, noted William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law, “Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment — including imprisonment and sadistic torture.”



Equally disturbing, noted the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, “violence targeting Coptic Orthodox Christians remained high.” But the Mubarak government rarely punished the attackers. Indeed, International Christian Concern noted that it was common for the government to arrest “Coptic victims alongside the perpetrators of the violence.”



Even when the Copts did not end up behind bars, they did not receive justice. State explained that the Mubarak government sponsored “informal reconciliation sessions” which “generally prevented the criminal prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against Copts, precluded their recourse to the judicial system for restitution, and contributed to a climate of impunity that encouraged further assaults.”



No surprise, failing to exact a penalty for murder and mayhem has led to more murder and mayhem — or what the Hudson Institute’s Nina Shea called “pogroms and acts of terror.” The failure to punish the perpetrators, complained the Commission, “continued to foster a climate of impunity, making further violence likely.” Even more emphatic was Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who told a recent congressional hearing that “the Egyptian regime is fully responsible for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine.”



Unfortunately, those who hoped the Egyptian revolution would better protect Christians and other religious minorities have been disappointed. To the contrary, violent attacks on Copts have been increasing.



As of last month 24 Christians had been killed, more than 200 had been injured, and three churches had been destroyed. Muslim mobs have beset Coptic churches, businesses, and homes. Well‐​armed thugs also attacked Christians who were protesting against the forgoing attacks.



No surprise, then, that few perpetrators have been arrested, let alone imprisoned. Noted Paul Marshall of the Hudson Institute: “as under Mubarak, the authorities’ refusal to punish attacks on Christians has led to more attacks.” The army even assaulted two Coptic monasteries, supposedly to enforce discriminatory zoning laws (which prohibited walls erected for protection from attacks).



Overall, the transition regime’s record is dismal. Noted the Commission: “Since February 11, military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators. Implementation of previous court rulings — related to granting official identity documents to Baha’is and changing religious affiliation on identity documents for Christian converts — continues to lag. In addition, the government has not responded adequately to combat widespread and virulent anti‐​Semitism in the government‐​controlled media.”



Islamic extremists are responsible for what increasingly looks to be a campaign of intimidation. The World Evangelical Alliance’s Religious Liberty Commission explained that the attacks were “mostly incited by conservative Salafi Muslims,” who are using violence to mobilize Islamist support. Salafis also led opposition to the choice of a Christian to be governor of the Qena Governorate, leading to a suspension of the appointment, even though his predecessor was a Christian. Traditionally, the Salafis had remained aloof from politics, but no longer. Alas, they make the Muslim Brotherhood appear moderate.



Nina Shea fears “what we’re seeing in Egypt today — namely, a reinvigorated effort by some of the country’s more radical Islamists to establish Egypt’s identity as a thoroughly Islamicized and Arabicized state.” The Copts “are the most visible bloc standing in the way of impatient jihadists and violent Salafis,” who therefore are accelerating their attacks.



The future looks increasingly bleak. Although there has been some pushback — Muslims rallied to help rebuild one of the destroyed churches — the vast majority of Egyptians express intolerance towards minority faiths. And Copts, as well as other Christians, are feeling the pressure.



The _Wall Street Journal_ entitled one article: “As Islamists Flex Muscle, Egypt’s Christians Despair.” It quoted Ayman Anwar Mitri, who was attacked by Islamists who cut off an ear and burned his apartment: “they kept saying: ‘We won’t leave any Christians in this country’.” No one was punished for the assault. One Salafi leader warned ominously: “Only those Christians who did something wrong should be fearful.” Mitri said simply: “Here, there is a war against the Copts.”



Shea worries about “a mass exodus” of Copts from Egypt if existing trends continue. In fact, the Egyptian media has reported an upsurge in Copts seeking to emigrate. Coptic human rights lawyer Naguib Gabriel said: “They are insisting on leaving Egypt because the risks of staying here are too great.” Iraq offers an ugly precedent, with the practical destruction of the large historic Christian community, which also precedes Islam. Syria has become the refuge for many Iraqi exiles, who fear that the overthrow of Bashar Assad could unleash similar violence there. The status of Christians and other religious minorities is growing ever more precarious throughout the Arab and broader Islamic world.



For the first time the USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern, which, if adopted by State, could lead to a variety of penalties. Still, Washington’s influence inevitably is limited. The Obama administration had no idea how to respond to Egypt’s upheaval, haphazardly offering support for Mubarak before exhibiting enthusiasm for the revolution — and its ever‐​changing stance had no effect on events on the street in any case.



Nevertheless, religious liberty should be part of the U.S. government’s official dialogue with existing regimes and revolutionary forces alike. Religious freedom is a bedrock form of human rights. This basic freedom of conscience acts as the proverbial canary in the mine. If peoples and governments are not willing to respect religious minorities, they are unlikely to tolerate political opponents. Religious extremism also acts as an efficient incubator for violence, including terrorism, as is increasingly evident in Pakistan. “There is no political vision to deal with these types of sectarian clashes,” admitted Emad Gad of the Cairo‐​based Al‐​Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.



While Washington cannot impose tolerance on the new Egypt, American officials can point to the danger posed by virulent Islamists to that nation’s future. If the radicals grow in influence, they are likely to sweep away more than the vulnerable Coptic population. They might take down the new political system, with dangerous consequences for Egypt and beyond. As Georgetown’s Thomas Farr testified before Congress last month: “There will be no real freedom in Egypt — period — and there will be no real stability in Egypt — period — unless there is full religious freedom in Egypt, not only for its Coptic minority but also for moderate and reformist Muslim voices.”



The Arab Spring risks turning into the Islamist Winter. The willingness to safeguard religious liberty has become a proxy for measuring the impact of the ongoing revolution. As go the Copts may ultimately go the rest of the Middle East.

"Angus Taylor says it is not Australia’s policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, despite signing up to the Paris agreement, because the Morrison government will not adopt a mid-century target in advance of a plan to achieve it. The energy minister said on Tuesday that signatories to the Paris agreement, including Australia, had agreed to hit net zero “in the second half of the century”. But scientists say in order to meet the central Paris goal of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C – a commitment Australia adopted in 2015 – signatories need to hit net zero by 2050. A new review of the government’s climate policies headed by former Business Council of Australia president Grant King notes that “like other signatories to the Paris agreement, Australia has agreed to adopt progressively more ambitious targets beyond 2030 and has endorsed the agreement’s overarching long-term goals, namely to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2C – and if possible below 1.5C – by achieving net zero emissions as soon as possible in the second half of the century”. Major business groups, including the Business Council of Australia and the Ai Group, say Australia should adopt the net zero by 2050 target. Earlier this month the Ai Group called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying it would boost growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. Every Australian state has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals. But asked on Tuesday whether net zero by 2050 was the federal government’s policy, Taylor said: “No.” “Our approach is not to have a target without a plan,” Taylor told the ABC. He said technology improvements would drive significant reductions in emissions “and we’d love to be able to achieve net zero by 2050, but ultimately that will depend on the pathways of technology to deliver that without damaging the economy”. The King review has recommended new approaches to reducing pollution including paying big emitters to keep their emissions below an agreed limit, and allowing businesses to bid for funding from the government’s climate policy – the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund – for projects that capture emissions and either use them or store them underground. The King review proposal to pay emitters to remain below their baseline looks like a voluntary carbon trading mechanism. The review says the idea “could be achieved by crediting emissions reductions below baselines and providing for the sale and purchase of … safeguard mechanism credits by the federal, state or territory governments or through voluntary transactions in carbon markets”. Despite that clear description in the review, Taylor contended initially on Tuesday the proposal was not a form of voluntary carbon trading. He said the review proposed a “carrot” to give companies an incentive to overachieve on their pollution reduction commitments. The Coalition has spent a decade opposing carbon pricing, and it abolished the emissions trading scheme legislated during the Gillard government. Rightwingers in the Liberal party also moved against Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership in part because he pursued a policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector. But after first saying the King proposal was not a form of carbon trading, the energy minister then argued that principle was “nothing new”. “You can trade Australian carbon credit units now. There is nothing new with that, that’s a pre-existing system we have through the emissions reduction fund.” It is unclear whether some of the proposals in the review would garner majority parliamentary support, but Taylor said some of the proposals might be able to be achieved without changing legislation."

 **Franklin Local Board (Pukekohe subdivision)**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



In 2016, all four positions on this subdivision were held by Team Franklin.  




[ **Karnail Badhan**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=868e41e3-e09c-42d6-bdd1-217f3bdcd5f8&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Independent **$**



I cannot over-stress the importance of running a grammar check on anything of importance that you write. Karnail didn’t do that with his profile statement. It’s hard to decipher exactly what he hopes to achieve. Were I not writing a voting guide, I’d have moved on long before reaching his swipe at Team Franklin down the bottom.



Badhan received a QSM for services to the Indian community in 2016 and has been the Head of the Ambedkar Sports & Cultural Club for 24 years. This is [Ambedkar](https://youtu.be/fz_0OHs7GjE?t=1021). It makes less sense to me than Aussie Rules but it is literally the first I’ve ever heard of it.



[ **Andy Baker**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=03d1a869-6125-4cbd-95ed-cd0dc289f173&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin **$$$$**



Andy Baker and the Baker family have a long history of involvement in local politics in Franklin, with Andy seeking a fourth term on the Franklin Local Board.



It is clear that significant growth is inevitable in Pukekohe and the Franklin region as a whole. Baker’s optimistic and constructive approach to working with Panuku is refreshing, in stark contrast to many other small-town NIMBY’s on the outer-edge of Auckland.



It means as well as embarking on a massive regeneration project for Pukekohe township, sales of Council land will also be reinvested in the region to ensure infrastructure and amenities can keep up with the coming population explosion.



Aside from some griping over a $15,000 report by AT examining what should be done with a historic train station (with a full removal and refurbishment estimated to cost $2.7 million), Andy has been a key personality driving the open-minded and optimistic response to the opportunities ahead.



[ **Alan Cole**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b7afd6c8-6b14-4e10-b9ae-436688312216&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin **$$$$**



Alan is cut from a different cloth to Baker having farmed in the area for 37 years. As part of the Pukekohe Business Association, the Rural Advisory Panel and President of Auckland Federated Farmers, he knows his industry and community inside out.



Cole has previously also been involved in a 2016 working group looking at appropriate steps to regulate nitrate levels in rivers and creeks that cross the area. An earlier process in Waikato has proven an abysmal failure with a heavily regulated top-down approach resulting in protracted legal action. That situation has been avoided in Franklin due, in part, to the work done by the Franklin Nitrate Reference Group including Cole.



[ **Ian Cummings**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a8bd82cb-d77e-4c88-a1c8-45e7bf3ae782&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Independent **$$$$$**



The more candidates I review in Franklin ward, the clearer it becomes that they’re a different breed in the far south. No “climate emergency glasses” or high school boys channelling Jacinda Ardern around here. Just straight up, practical and genuine people stepping up for their neighbourhood.  
  
Cummings is most definitely one of those people. Having him on Franklin Local Board is the best insurance policy I can think of against colleagues who may be tempted to splash your money out on nonsensical vanity projects.



He will ensure value for every ratepayer dollar the board spends, make sure the Board’s activities are as public and transparent as possible and be the best watchdog against Council incompetence you could elect.



The safest, closest and friendliest neighbourhoods are those built from the bottom up by residents, volunteers and local businesses mucking in to support one another. Ian is one of those residents and absolutely deserves your vote!



[ **Baljit Kaur**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b5a0f84b-13e3-4f30-8684-7dd07e7bc411&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Labour Party 



Baljit is a perennial Labour candidate, having been thumped in the 2017 general election by Andrew Bayly by over 17,000 votes and finished almost last in the Botany subdivision of Howick Local Board in 2016. Not a resident of the Pukekohe subdivision, Kaur looks more like a window shopper than a genuine representative.



If elected to Local Board, she will embark on completely unrelated projects such as advocating for improved health. She doesn’t mince words when expressing her passion for social issues; this is the first candidate I’ve seen in this region pitching diversity as a reason to elect her to the board.



You’re not in Botany now Ms. Kaur.



[ **Amanda Kinzett**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e95a2874-3700-4383-8082-79e449595c6a&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin 



This is an unusual campaign pitch, almost entirely about the 12 years she spent working in Onehunga as the Town Manager. She doesn’t include anything she actually accomplished unless “great wins” counts? She manages to write a full sentence mentioning achievements three times without specifying what any of them are.  
  
The one practical thing she does mention is sitting. She does that most of the day. In traffic. Kinzett is very aware that this is a complete waste of time. She’s frustrated but is yet to find a solution other than standing for election to Franklin local board. 



Considering she also thinks the local community know what is best for them, I can’t see any scenario in which Kinzett adds value by sitting on your board.



[ **Dave Pope**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=846aa134-9f84-44c5-85bd-b24fd06f61cf&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Independent **$**



Pope has a photo news website [www.franklinlifenz.com](http://www.franklinlifenz.com/) I guess he chose photography because he clearly can’t write. Having lived overseas for some time has shown him the future of Pukekohe and it would appear he is pessimistic.



It looks like your local board funds will be channelled into nocturnal security guards driving around the streets, assuming there is any money left over following an inquiry into the linking of Nelson St and Golding Rd for the Bombay traffic bypass.



The two streets are very distant from each other, one is largely in the Waikato region and, despite how confused I am, I think I can work out that it is nothing the Local Board can achieve. AT might consult them. Consult…



I’m not convinced that anyone should conclude their pitch to voters with “A vote for him, is a vote for one of your own kind. (sic)” 



[**Logan Soole**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=c37af353-c3f4-41e6-83bf-eb8f14fd32f0&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Franklin%20Local%20Board%20\(Pukekohe%20Subdivision\))– Team Franklin **$$$**



The departure of Niko Kloeten opened up a vacancy for Team Franklin token young person. Former Pukekohe High School Head Boy Logan Soole has filled that place.



His profile is very vague, with several phrases that could come from anywhere on the political spectrum. However, he is a keen community volunteer so as long as he doesn’t discover drugs are more fun than Board meetings, he should do OK.



 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** You may cast up to 4 votes in this FPP contest.

Nearly two weeks ago, I blogged about some strange procedural developments in the big global warming case coming out of the Gulf Coast, _Comer v. Murphy Oil USA_. On the eve of final briefing deadlines before the _en banc_ Fifth Circuit, an eighth judge of that court recused from the case (we don’t know the reason, but the previous seven recusals were presumably due to stock ownership) and so the court was faced with an unprecedented situation: losing an _en banc_ quorum after previously having had enough of one to vacate the panel decision and grant _en banc_ rehearing in the first place. We were all set to file our brief when the Clerk of the Fifth Circuit issued an order notifying the parties of the lost quorum and canceling the scheduled hearing — and nothing more. Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to go ahead with filing late last week.   
  
  
Again, here’s the situation: Mississippi homeowners sued 34 energy companies and utilities operating in the Gulf Coast for damage sustained to their property during Hurricane Katrina. The homeowners alleged that the defendants had emitted greenhouse gases, which increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contributed to global warming, which accelerated the melting of glaciers, which raised the global sea level, which increased the frequency and severity of hurricanes, which caused the destructive force of Hurricane Katrina. The district court concluded that it lacked the authority to resolve the public debate over global warming and dismissed the case. A Fifth Circuit panel reversed this dismissal, holding that the homeowners have standing to raise some of their claims and that those claims are appropriate for resolution by the federal courts. The Fifth Circuit then granted rehearing _en banc_.   
  
  
Cato filed an _amicus_ brief on the energy companies’ behalf, arguing that homeowners lack standing to bring their suit and that the case raises a nonjusticiable political question. Our brief asserts that the homeowners’ claim does not provide a clear causal connection between the harm suffered and any particular conduct by the energy companies, and that the money damages the homeowners requested would not remedy the environmental harm alleged. More importantly, we maintain that political questions such as those surrounding climate change must be resolved by Congress, not the federal courts. Put simply, the Constitution prohibits federal courts from resolving highly technical social and economic policy debates. Permitting plaintiffs to achieve “regulation by litigation” would not only contradict settled Supreme Court precedent, but would betray the separation of powers principles embodied in the Constitution.   
  
  
The Clerk has since directed the parties to brief the procedural issues surrounding the apparent lost quorum, which letter‐​briefs came in this week (as a mere _amicus_ , we did not file on this). I’ll spare you the technical details, but there are three possible ways in which the Fifth Circuit could now rule: 1) the court actually does have a quorum and thus oral argument is resecheduled; 2) the panel decision is reinstated (with an ensuing cert petition appealing that decision to the Supreme Court); and 3) the district court is affirmed without opinion (the same result as when an appellate court vote is tied). Stay tuned — this is a truly weird denouement to a hugely important case.

On Sallenger et al (2012) – Hotspot of Accelerated Sea Level Rise on the Atlantic Coast of North America
Guest post by Bob Tisdale
John Droz Jr. asked me to comment on the Sallenger et al (2012) paper Hotspot of Accelerated Sea Level Rise on the Atlantic Coast of North America. As you’ll recall, John Droz Jr. has reported on pending North Carolina legislation about rising sea level. Refer to the WattsUpWithThat posts here and here. Apparently, North Carolina lawmakers are concerned about the use of the word “accelerated” in Sallenger et al (2012). So I took an initial look at the sea level data for the Atlantic Coast “Hotspot”.
The shift in trends around 1990 noted in Sallenger et al (2012) appears to be a function of the natural variability of the North Atlantic.
In fact, Sallenger et al (2012) in their closing comments state that this is a possibility, but it was impossible for them to tell due to the limited availability of data (my boldface):

In regard to the role of cycles, the single ~ 60-yr pattern in Fig. 4a does not seem associated with 10–30 yr sea-level variations discussed in ref. 27. With our limited series length, the presence of cycles, for example associated with natural ocean variability and/or AMO, is indeterminate. In the Holocene geologic record of an NEH marsh, the authors of ref. 28found evidence of several rapid SLR increases separated by 900 yr or more that they associated with gyre changes. Regardless, our correlations suggest that should temperatures rise in the twenty-first century as projected, the NEH SLRD will continue to increase. If future sea-level variability is forced by aerosols and/or is part of a cycle, SLR in the NEH may also alternately fall below and rise above projections of IPCC scenarios alone.
Our analyses support a recent acceleration of SLR on ~ 1,000 km of the east coast of North America north of Cape Hatteras. This hotspot is consistent with SLR associated with a slowdown of AMOC.
In other words, Sallenger et al (2012) note there is an accelerated rate at which sea level is rising for a portion of the Atlantic coast of the United States, starting around 1990, but they don’t know the cause. In the opening sentence of the above quote, they comment about the observed 60-year cycles in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and how they do not agree with the results of their reference 27, which is Frankcombe and Dijkstra (2009) Coherent multidecadal variability in North Atlantic sea level.
The abstract of Frankcombe and Dijkstra (2009) reads:
Tide gauge records from around the North Atlantic are examined and found to show variability on 20–30 year time scales. Sea surface height variability along the western boundary of the North Atlantic shows a particularly strong and coherent signal. Similar variability is also found in an ensemble of runs using a state-of-the-art climate model (GFDL CM2.1). This sea surface height variability is linked to variability of temperatures in the upper layers of the ocean and thence to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The variability is consistent with the excited internal ocean mode mechanism of multidecadal variability derived from idealised models and the timescale is consistent with that derived from observations of sub-surface temperature variability.
The last sentence Frankcombe and Dijkstra (2009) reads:
The long tide gauge records analysed here certainly point to the importance of the 20–30 year period over the 50–70 year period more commonly associated with the AMO.
Immediately, one wants to examine a time-series graph of the “Hotspot” sea level data in the Sallenger et al (2012) paper to get an idea of what the multidecadal variability in the data looks like. If there’s a 20-30 cycle in the data, and if the last cycle started in 1990, then odds are the cycle has already peaked and has started back down again. Also, picking the last break point in a dataset with known multidecadal variability, adding before and after trends to the data, and then stating the data during the last period has accelerated has a familiar ring to it. It sounds very similar to the nonsensical tactic the IPCC tried in FAQ 3.1 Figure 1 from their 4thAssessment Report to show that global surface temperatures were warming at an accelerated rate.
Curiously, there were no time-series graphs of the “hotspot” sea level anomalies in Sallenger et al (2012). That raises the question: what didn’t they want to show?
To determine the multidecadal signal in the East Coast “Hotspot” sea level data, I downloaded Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) tidal gage-based sea level data, same dataset used in Sallenger et al (2012), from the KNMI Climate Explorer. It can be found there on their Monthly station datawebpage. As you many of you are aware, the tidal gage-based sea level data is sparse, rarely continuous, and few have more than a few decades of data. In other words, it’s troublesome to work with, which is one of the reasons I rarely look at sea level data. So I selected the stations with the longest data, 70 years or more, along the Atlantic coast that were included in the “hot-spot” group of Sallenger et al (2012), from North Carolina to Massachusetts, that were also relatively continuous; that is, they did not have a lot of missing data. They included New York (Battery), Philadelphia (Pier9N), Atlantic City, Boston, Newport, Hampton Roads, and Sandy Hook. Since John Droz was interested in North Carolina, I added Wilmington, NC to the mix. We’ll call the combination of those datasets “Hotspot+1”. The Wilmington data had the shortest term, so it set the start year of 1935. Not too surprisingly, it had the lowest trend from 1935 to 2008. Refer to Figure 1. However, since we’re going to detrend the data, its lower trend would have little influence on this preliminary look at the East Coast sea level data. Note: The PSMSL data at the KNMI climate Explorer ends in 2008. Sallenger et al (2012) ended their analyses in 2009, so we’ve only lost a year.

Figure 1
Figure 2 presents the average sea level anomalies of those “Hotspot+1” stations along with the linear trend. Assuming the average sea level anomalies of the 8 stations used in this presentation provide a curve that’s similar to the stations Sallenger et al (2012) used for their “Hotspot”, this may illustrate the reason why Sallenger et al (2012) excluded a time series graph for their average “Hotspot” sea level data. It appears sea level anomalies for the “Hotspot+1” stations have been relatively flat since about 1996.

Figure 2
Since one of the points being discussed is decadal to multidecadal variability, we’ll detrend the “Hotspot+1” average, to help show if it exists. Figure 3 presents the detrended average of the “Hotspot+1” sea level anomalies.

Figure 3
First things first: Is there a break point around 1990 when the trends shift? There is definitely a shift in trends before and after 1989/90 in the detrended “Hotspot+1” sea level data, Figure 4. There are also comparable shifts in trend around 1976/77 and about 1981/82, Figure 5 and 6. But Sallenger et al (2012) went through a detailed analysis and elected to discuss the shift around 1990.

Figure 4
HHHHHHH

Figure 5
HHHHHHH

Figure 6
I’ve filtered the detrended “Hotspot+1” average sea level anomalies with a 13-month running-average filter (centered on the 7thmonth) in Figure 7 to reduce the month-to-month variability. The spikes in 1972/73 and 1997/98 may lead one to believe that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have a major influence on it.

Figure 7
Whatever is causing the sea level anomalies to vary, there is a multidecadal signal visible in the detrended “Hotspot+1” sea level anomalies. See Figure 8. In it, I’ve smoothed the data with a 121-month running-average filter, which is commonly used when illustrating decadal and multidecadal variability like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Now we can understand why Sallenger et al (2012) were discussing a multidecadal signal. One very plainly exists.

Figure 8
Looking at the trailing decadal (120-month) trends, Figure 9, we can see very clearly that the trend of the most recent decade (through December 2008) is not as high as it has been in the past. Also note that the peaks in the decadal trends occurred about the time of the three largest El Niño events that weren’t counteracted by volcanic aerosols. They were the El Niño events of 1972/73, 1986/87/88 and 1997/98. The eruption of El Chichon occurred at the same time as the 1982/83 El Niño and likely offset the effects of that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on the sea level anomaly trends. Oddly, ENSO isn’t mentioned in Sallenger et al (2012). Volcanic aerosols are mentioned in the closing of Sallenger et al (2012), however. Are the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon in 1982 and of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 the reasons for the low, actually negative, decadal sea level trends around the same time? If so, why did sea level trends drop in the early 2000s?

Figure 9
What about the Wilmington, NC sea level anomalies?
The sea level anomalies of Wilmington have a relatively low linear trend compared to the long-term stations used by Sallenger et al (2012). Refer back to Figure 1. Looking at the detrended Wilmington sea level data when smoothed with a 121-month filter, they have a different multidecadal signal than the “Hotspot” average. See Figure 10. The latest upswing started about 1976, then peaked near 1996, and the downswing was still in progress though the end of 2008.

Figure 10
The running decadal trends for Wilmington, Figure 11, reveal they have been negative since 2002. That is, on a decadal basis, sea level anomalies in Wilmington have been falling, not rising, since 2002. Have they risen since 2008?  It makes one wonder why Sallenger et al (2012) chose to exclude the last few years of data from their analyses!

CLOSING
North Carolina is considering new legislation about the rise is sea level. It would be a shame if the incomplete analysis and data presentation by Sallenger et al (2012) and their use of the word “accelerated” influenced it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe metaphor just couldn’t be more fitting: desperate true believers of global warming/accelerating polar ice melt now find themselves trapped by thousands of square kilometers of summertime sea ice that wasn’t supposed to be there.
No picture could better symbolize and communicate the intellectual bankruptcy and disillusionment of a faithful group who refuse to believe they have been led astray. This has to be deeply embarrassing, if not outright humiliating.
It’s reported here that many of the climate science boatpeople are actually from renowned media outlets, like The Guardian, who we can safely assume were onboard hoping to capture dramatic images of vast areas of open sea water, or of calving ice sheets with hundreds of tons of ice breaking off and plunging into the sea hourly. And with a little luck, maybe even some photos of a couple of drowned penguins.
Nowadays true believers find themselves journeying to the extreme corners of the globe in a desperate search for signs of the coming climate catastrophe. Signs are getting tougher to come by.
Indeed in Antarctica what they found was a reality that was precisely the exact opposite of what they had expected or had hoped for: no open sea seas – just thousands and thousands of square kilometers of sea ice, which ironically turned on them.
“Post-hoc rationalizations of model failures”
To save face they are changing their story and concocting new rationalizations. Perhaps all the unexpected ice is in fact a sign of warming after all!  This, for example, is what senior science writer for Comedy Climate Central Andrew Freedman is now claiming at Twitter, much to the rich entertainment of skeptics:


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





You see, Freedman explains, it’s all in connection with “ozone depletion” and it all comes “with human fingerprints“.
And when pressed on why warming is causing less ice in the Arctic but more in the Antarctic, climate science boat-person Freedman tweets: “…key to remember is the geographical circumstances are totally different.”
Freedmann gets so deep into it that Bishop Hill eventually calls his claims “handwaving post-hoc rationalisations of model failures.” Another reader writes he thinks Freedman “is making it up as he goes along“. Anthony Watts tweets near the end: “Andrew Freedman is falling for the same ‘anything consistent with AGW’ silly logic fail that Laden did.”
Obviously the climate boatpeople are desperate and have nothing else left to lose.

"**Guernsey Sports teams have expressed concern the island's main sports hall used as a Covid-19 vaccination centre for at least five months.**
The Sir John Loveridge Hall at Beau Sejour Leisure centre will be converted into a central hub for vaccinating islanders until May, the States have announced.
The hall will be converted into a clinical space from December 21.
It will be used to vaccinate the vast majority of people during the roll out.
One of the sports which could be cancelled is Guernsey's eight-a-side football league.
Colin Le Prevost acknowledged the need for the vaccination programme, but argued the decision would cost the centre a lot of income from sports teams and potentially harm the health and wellbeing of islanders.
Mr Le Prevost said: ""It's not only a case of getting fit, it's also keeping fit.""
He also expressed concern over ""health and safety"" for teams with a move to an alternative venue like a school gym.
""You've got all the apparatus around the area, you don't want to be hitting that because you will be having injuries,"" Mr Le Prevost added.
The vaccine programme is separated into tiers, with care home residents, care workers and older islanders given first priority.
Highest priority groups and most at risk islanders will be vaccinated in a primary care setting, including care home residents, all care staff and people at high risk of severe coronavirus symptoms.
The States of Guernsey said the hall had been selected because it met key requirements for operating the vaccine programme, all other options had been considered before selection and it was exploring all options to support displaced sports clubs.
Director of Public Health Dr Nicola Brink said: ""The decision to use the Sir John Loveridge Hall was not taken lightly.
""I am acutely aware of the benefit sporting activities have on people's health and wellbeing and the hall will be used for the minimum possible time."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Arctic, we are told, is the canary in the climate coal mine. No place on the planet is supposed to warm faster. As global warming takes hold, we are really supposed to see it at the Earth’s poles. If that’s true, then we should really be opening up our minds to the real possibility of a cooling planet because summertimes at the North Pole are cooling.

Three of the last five Arctic summers have been the coldest on record. Graphics snipped from the dmi.dk.
Arctic summers can be examined going back to 1958 using data from the Danish Meteorological Institute here. It turns out the 3 coldest Arctic summers have all occurred in the last 5 years. Not even the summers of the 1960s were colder. 2013 still has about three weeks to go, yet the forecasts show that it’s place in the record books is pretty much secured.
So why has Arctic sea ice extent reached record lows over the past 5 years, we might ask? Sea ice melt involves a lot more than just surface atmospheric temperature. Historical records show that a major force is ocean cycles. From 1980 to 2000, both the AMO and PDO saw warm phases, and so the Arctic ice melt was likely caused by the warmer surface sea water. But now that the PDO has flipped to its cool phase and the AMO is transitioning to its cool phase, we can expect the Arctic to begin its recovery over the next 2 decades – just like it did during the 1950s and 60s. There’s likely a decade or so lag between Arctic surface temperatures and sea ice coverage.
I’d bet a good bottle of Scotch that we’ll be seeing a rising Arctic sea ice trend over the next 10 years.
Finally, not only the North Pole is chilling out, but so is the South Pole, which has been setting record highs for sea ice extent. See here.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
Coronavirus cases in England fell by almost a third in two weeks after the current lockdown was introduced. That's the conclusion of React-1, a highly-respected study by Imperial College London, which swabbed more than 100,000 people between 13 and 24 November. Some of the worst-hit areas in the North saw the biggest improvements, and the R rate fell to 0.88 - here's a reminder of why that matters so much. Overall, though, cases across the country remain high, with the East and West Midlands the current hotspots. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says we can't ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"".
Boris Johnson insists the tougher three-tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, is what's needed to keep cases falling, but dozens of his MPs remain to be convinced. To that end, he's agreed to publish the social, economic and health impact assessment of the measures, and is urging sceptics to show ""unity and resolve"". The PM hopes to limit the numbers who rebel when the measures are put to a vote tomorrow. Our political correspondent Iain Watson says it would be embarrassing for the PM to have to rely on opposition votes. Check the latest virus rules wherever you are in the UK.
The mass Covid testing of students is starting at many universities across the UK today, aimed at allowing them to go home safely for Christmas. Universities are opening temporary testing centres and students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they get a negative result, many will leave in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December. Many will continue their studies remotely - learn more about the tech allowing them to sit exams at home.
Nearly 700,000 more people have fallen into poverty due to the pandemic, according to right-leaning think tank the Legatum Institute. But it says the figure would be twice that if it wasn't for a Â£20 uplift to universal credit introduced to help those struggling to cope. It's urging the government to keep the extra payment as long as it's needed. So far ministers have confirmed the uplift will be secure until March. People who've lost their jobs are among the worst hit - see just how bad the unemployment picture could get.
It's fair to say it's been a tough year, but beavers - and their human supporters - have cause to celebrate. The rodents became extinct in the UK in the 16th Century due to hunting, but have been successfully reintroduced at a handful of sites in recent years. Today we've learned that one group has built a dam on Exmoor for the first time in more than 400 years. Read more about why 2020 has been good for beavers \- but also why not everyone is a fan.

At the beginning of 2009, the president’s economists told the public that passing an $862 billion “stimulus” package was the medicine the sick economy needed. We were told that its pas sage would keep unemployment from going above 8 percent. Instead, unemployment has remained close to 10 percent ever since.



The overall unemployment rate in Virginia has also increased but remains below the national average. However, counties that don’t border the D.C. spending epicenter have unemployment rates that often match or exceed the national average. Virginia has been awarded some $4.5 billion in stimulus funds, yet private sector employment remains flat.



Never mind all that, says the administration. The stimulus package prevented a second great depression, it says. Last month, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisors released an analysis claiming that the stimulus created or saved between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs.





Policymakers today have no choice but to drastically reduce spending if we are to head off the looming fiscal train wreck.



Sounds good, but how did the CEA arrive at this conclusion?



Fuzzy math.



The first analysis used economic modeling to estimate the number of jobs created or saved. The model the CEA used assumed that government spending will have a positive multiplier effect on the economy. Voilà — the stimulus created jobs!



In the second analysis, the CEA estimated the stimulus bill’s effects by comparing real changes in gross domestic product and employment against a baseline forecast. However, even the CEA admits that this approach is subject to “considerable margins of error,” and that “the comparison will reflect not just the impact of fiscal policy, but all other unusual influences on the economy following passage of the Act.”



Translation: “We don’t know.”



That the stimulus did create jobs isn’t in question. The real question is whether it created any net jobs after all the negative effects of the spending and debt are taken into account. How many private‐​sector jobs were lost or not created in the first place because of the resources diverted to the government for its job creation?



Don’t expect the administration’s economists to attempt an answer to that question any time soon.



Here’s another question that the administration would prefer to ignore: How many jobs are being lost or not created because of increased uncertainty in the business community over future tax increases and other detrimental government policies?



The economist Robert Higgs coined the phrase “regime uncertainty” to describe Franklin Roosevelt’s anti‐​business climate, which prolonged the Great Depression. Unfortunately, this president is repeating the same mistake.



Health care mandates, cap‐​and‐​trade legislation, new financial regulations, union protections, and the probability of higher taxes to pay for the administration’s debt spree have caused innumerable businesses to remain on the sidelines.



As one small business owner recently told me, “I want to hire but I’m afraid the administration’s policies are going to force me to turn around and let them go.”



The president is countering these objections by traversing the country handing out government checks to pet industries. Apparently in the president’s economic Field of Dreams, “if we subsidize it, they will come.” Too bad past administrations have already poured billions of taxpayer dollars down the drain on similar failed top‐​down planning schemes.



So what should the administration do?



Put simply, the opposite of what it has been doing. It has become gospel in some quarters that massive deficit spending is necessary to get the economy back on its feet.



History offers no support for this contention.



Most recently, the Japanese tried to spend their way out of their economic doldrums in the 1990s. The result was Japan’s “lost decade.”



Our own history offers evidence that reducing the government’s footprint on the private sector is the better way to get the economy going. Take for example, the “Not‐​So‐​Great Depression” of 1920–21. Cato Institute scholar Jim Powell notes that President Warren G. Harding inherited from his predecessor Woodrow Wilson “a post‐​World War I depression that was almost as severe, from peak to trough, as the Great Contraction from 1929 to 1933 that FDR would later inherit.”



Instead of resorting to deficit spending to “stimulate” the economy, taxes and government spending were cut. Hello Roaring Twenties.



Similarly, fears at the end of World War II that demobilization would result in double‐​digit unemployment when the troops returned home were unrealized. Instead, spending was dramatically reduced, economic controls were lifted, and the returning troops were successfully reintegrated into the economy.



Policymakers today have no choice but to drastically reduce spending if we are to head off the looming fiscal train wreck. Stimulus proponents generally recognize that our fiscal path is unsustainable, but they argue that the current debt binge is nonetheless critical to an economic recovery. Nonsense.



Not only has Washington’s profligacy left us worse off, our children now face the prospect of reduced living standards and crushing debt.

"Scientists have created the first large-scale map of microscopic algae on the Antarctic peninsula as they bloom across the surface of the melting snow, tinting the surface green and potentially creating a source of nutrition for other species. The British team behind the research believe these blooms will expand their range in the future because global heating is creating more of the slushy conditions they need to thrive. In some areas, the single-cell life-forms are so dense they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications. Biologists from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey spent six years detecting and measuring the green snow algae using a combination of satellite data and ground observation. The result is the first large-scale algae map of the peninsular, which will be used as a baseline to assess the speed at which the white continent is turning green due to the climate crisis and potentially offering sustenance to other species. They have already found the algae have formed close bonds with tiny fungal spores and bacteria. “It’s a community. This could potentially form new habitats. In some place, it would be the beginning of a new ecosystem,” said Matt Davey of Cambridge University, one of the scientists who led the study. He described the algae map as a missing piece of the carbon cycle jigsaw in the Antarctic. It identifies 1,679 separate blooms of green snow algae, which together covered an area of 1.9 sq km, equating to a carbon sink of about 479 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the emissions of about 875,000 car journeys in the UK, though in global terms it is too small to make much of a difference to the planet’s carbon budget. Almost two-thirds of the green algal blooms were found on small, low-lying islands around the peninsula, which has experienced some of the most intense heating in the world, with new temperature records being set this summer. The snow algae were less conspicuous in colder, southern regions. Scientists have previously observed a change in green lichen and moss, but these grow extremely slowly compared with algae. In future, they will also measure red and orange algae and calculate how the presence of such colourful forms might be affecting the heat-reflecting albedo quality of the snow. “I think we will get more large blooms in the future. Before we know whether this has a significant impact on carbon budgets or bio albedo, we need to run the numbers,” said Andrew Gray, the lead author of the paper."
"The idea that spending recreational time in natural settings is good for our health and wellbeing is hardly new. Parents have been telling their kids to “go play outside, it’s good for you” for generations. Now, colleagues and I have published a study in the journal Scientific Reports which suggests that a dose of nature of just two hours a week is associated with better health and psychological wellbeing, a figure that applies to every demographic we could think of (at least in England).  So why do we need research into this? Although our parents’ common sense observation is true in the general sense, the devil – as always – is in the detail. For instance, it’s less intuitively obvious exactly how much time in nature we need before we experience the benefits, whether we can have “too much of a good thing”, whether it’s better to have lots of smaller encounters or one big one, whether parks, beaches and mountains offer similar benefits, or whether nature exposure is more important for some people than others.  We wanted to answer these questions so we could start developing recommended guidelines about how much time people should spend in nature. Similar guidelines have been developed to advise 150 minutes of physical activity per week, or that five portions of fruit and veg a day benefits health. Our findings do not yet offer a final recommendation, but we think they are an important starting point. Our research used responses from a large, representative sample of 20,000 adults in England, collected as part of an annual government advisory survey on Engagement with the Natural Environment. The survey takes place in people’s homes and interviewers ask respondents to go through each of the previous seven days and describe any time they spent “out of doors” in natural settings such as urban parks, woods, or beaches on each day.  Once this nature “diary” has been reconstructed, interviewers randomly select a previous visit in the past week, and ask more extensive details such as how long the visit was, who they went with, how they got there, and what they got up to. This “random” selection aspect is really important scientifically because it means we get to learn about people’s visits in general, not merely the “highlight” events that most stick in the memory. Using these responses, we were able to build a profile of how much time each of our 20,000 respondents spent in nature per week. To figure out how this was linked to health and well-being, we looked at the responses given by the same people to two further questions on general health and overall “life satisfaction”. We found that people who spent at least two hours a week in nature were more likely to report “good” health or “high” levels of well-being than people who spent no time in nature. People who spent some time in nature, but less than two hours, were no more likely to report good health and well-being than those who had zero weekly exposure, suggesting that one can have too little. Further, after about five hours a week, there was some evidence of no additional benefits. Perhaps most importantly, this pattern of a “two-hour threshold” was present for nearly all groups we looked at: older and younger adults, men and women, people in cities and in rural areas, people in deprived and wealthy communities, and even among people with and without a long-term illness or disability.  This suggests our results are not merely due to “reverse causality” – the possibility that people who visit nature are already a self-selected sample of healthier people. Even those with long-term illnesses were more likely to report better health and well-being if they spent 120 minutes a week in nature.  Although encouraging, we must be careful about overplaying these results. The fact remains that the data was self-reported and “cross-sectional”. Despite our best efforts, we can’t rule out the possibility that people didn’t accurately remember the time they spent in nature last week, or are nervous about talking about their health and well-being to interviewers. We don’t think this was too much of an issue here because the questions were simple, taken from internationally recognised surveys, including the census, and have been shown to be highly reliable.  Furthermore, there is a large body of experimental work, including work using stress biomarkers, which essentially shows that time spent in nature is good for physiological and psychological health – our main advance here is taking a step towards understanding a weekly dose.  There is increasing pressure on our parks and other green spaces to be used for urgently needed housing and other infrastructure. Colleagues and I fully appreciate that these alternative land uses are important, but we feel these spaces themselves are often undervalued. By improving our understanding of how spending time in nature is related to health and well-being we hope to better inform these decisions on what to do with green space.  Access to most parks and green spaces is free, so even the poorest, and often the least healthy, members of communities have equal access for their health and well-being. We hope that evidence such as ours will help keep them that way."
"The eastern Caribbean island of Montserrat has suffered more than its fair share of natural disaster.  In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the island, causing massive destruction with more than 90% of the island’s structures damaged. In 1995, just as the island started to recover, the island’s Soufrière Hills volcano burst into life, entering a cycle of eruptive activity that continues to the present day. The eruption had an enormous impact on the island, killing 19 people, leaving two-thirds of the island nation uninhabitable, and in 1997 completely burying the capital city, Plymouth, under metres of volcanic rock, ash and mud. More than half the island’s population of around 10,000 were compelled to emigrate. Today, however, Montserrat is putting this violent geological heritage to good use. Known as the “Emerald Isle” of the Caribbean due to historical ties with the Irish, Montserrat (in fact a UK dependent territory) is poised to become one of the world’s few metaphorically “green” and sustainable islands. The same geological forces unleashed by the Soufrière Hills volcano are being harnessed to power the island’s electricity grid from a geothermal source.  Geothermal energy, the productive use of the vast quantity of thermal energy within the Earth’s crust, is one of the few renewable, low-carbon emission energy sources that can consistently generate power 24-hours a day, irrespective of the season. Its primary limitation is not weather but location, as it can only be exploited in places with specific geology, where some of the Earth’s intense inner heat reaches close enough to the surface to be of use.
Montserrat’s geology is ideal for geothermal use: hot molten magma rises to shallow depths, driven by the forces of regional plate tectonics. The heat from this magma warms the surrounding rocks, providing a heat source that can be tapped if it can be brought back to the surface. Rainwater and seawater are natural aids to this process as they penetrate through cracks and pores in the rocks to several kilometres beneath the island, absorbing heat from the magma heated rocks. Once heated, the hot fluid rises buoyantly to shallower levels where it can be tapped by drilling geothermal wells. As the ascending fluid boils it produces pressurised steam which rotates turbines to generate electricity. The high cost of drilling wells (a single well can cost several million US dollars) coupled with the potential risk of drilling an unproductive well, are the principle reasons that geothermal potential has not been fully exploited. To increase the likelihood of drilling a productive well, the project to exploit geothermal power on Montserrat used an array of technologies, such as magnetotellurics and seismic tomography to more clearly understand the rocks beneath the surface. Magnetotellurics uses naturally occurring signals from lightning storms and charged particles ejected from the sun to penetrate below ground. Seismic tomography uses the responses of pressure waves created by carefully generated explosions to generate images of the rocks. Aided by researchers at the University of Auckland these techniques were used to create the subsurface maps that have successfully guided Montserrat’s geothermal drilling programme. Between March and September of 2013 the Iceland Drilling Company drilled Montserrat’s first two geothermal wells, to depths of 2,300 and 2,900 metres, striking temperatures of over 260°C. While testing is still ongoing, the initial results suggest that the fluid flowing from the wells will be able to generate more power than needed by the island’s reduced population of around 5,000 inhabitants. Once completed, the geothermal power station will free the island from its current reliance on expensive diesel-powered generators for its electricity – currently among the most expensive electricity in the world. Montserrat is not the only nation in the region with geothermal aspirations. All of the islands of the Lesser Antilles have similar geological settings and therefore geothermal potential. The French island of Guadeloupe, with 15MW of installed capacity, is the only Caribbean island that currently uses geothermal energy for electricity, but recently private investment in St Kitts and Nevis and a European Union funded project in Dominica have also resulted in several promising exploratory wells, with discussions underway on other islands keen to harness their geothermal potential.  Geoscientists have recognised the geothermal potential of the region for many decades. But it is only in the past few years that the promise of a cheap, local energy source that can free the region from volatile oil prices has caught the imagination of regional governments and agencies."

It is a ‘climate emergency’! Poor St. Greta had to sail the Atlantic to show us how dire it had all become. Local authorities up and down the country have told us so. People are gluing themselves to roads, that is how bad the situation is, and the only thing that can possibly save us is replacing ‘dirty’ so-called fossil fuels with even dirtier ‘clean’ energy.



Once we have this ‘new’ energy, we will be able to expand the economy forever without consequence.



Yes, sunshine and wind are obviously clean but the turning either of those into electricity is anything but a clean, harmless process. The Greens, here, stomp on any suggestion of mineral extraction, but their brave new world requires massive increases in mining of metals and rare-earth minerals. This comes with ecological and social consequences. 



Based upon a 2017 World Bank report, to get to the zero-carbon nirvana would require building enough solar and wind plants to generate 14 TW of electricity by 2050. 



This requires a supply of 34 million metric tons of copper, 40 million tons of lead, 50 million tons of zinc, 162 million tons of aluminium, and 4.8 billion tons of iron.



Having dealt with the electricity for living as we now do, we then need to power all the electric vehicles. This year, a group of leading British scientists submitted a [letter](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/leading-scientists-set-out-resource-challenge-of-meeting-net-zer.html) to the UK Committee on Climate Change outlining their concerns about the ecological impact of electric cars. 



Replacing the world’s projected fleet of 2 billion vehicles will result in even more demand for mining. (Are you listening, Sage, Genter et al?)



This mining has to continue every year until 2050. And it is not going to be battery-powered excavators doing the digging!



Take silver, for instance. Mexico is home to the Peñasquito mine, one of the biggest silver mines in the world. Covering nearly 40 square miles, the operation is staggering in its scale: a sprawling open-pit complex ripped into the mountains, flanked by two waste dumps each a mile long, and a tailings dam full of toxic sludge held back by a wall that’s 7 miles around and as high as a 50-story skyscraper. This mine will produce 11,000 tons of silver in 10 years before its reserves, the biggest in the world, are gone.



To transition the global economy to renewables, **we need to commission up to 130 more mines on the scale of Peñasquito. Just for silver.**



Lithium is another ecological disaster. **It takes 500,000 gallons of water to produce a single ton of lithium.** Even at present levels of extraction this is causing problems. In the Andes, where most of the world’s lithium is located, mining companies are burning through the water tables and leaving farmers with nothing to irrigate their crops. Many have had no choice but to abandon their land altogether. Meanwhile, chemical leaks from lithium mines have poisoned rivers from Chile to Argentina, Nevada to Tibet, killing off whole freshwater ecosystems. The lithium boom has barely even started, and it’s already a crisis.



It would seem that the real ‘clean’ energy that the Greens want us all to embrace is NO energy at all.



Petroleum-based energy looks darn attractive to me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier in the week news poured out from the media about a commentary appearing in Nature by Gail Whiteman, Chris Hope, and Peter Wadhams, who claim that methane released by “thawing permafrost beneath the East Siberian Sea, off northern Russia, alone comes with an average global price tag of $60 trillion in the absence of mitigating action — a figure comparable to the size of the world economy in 2012.” Absurd.

Nature devolves to a science-fantasy tabloid.
In school we were taught when solving a science problem to ask yourself if the answer you got really made sense. For example: How big would John’s bucket need to be if he wanted to fill the bath tub with it in 15 minutes? If the answer you get is something 5000 cubic meters, then you can be sure the answer is wrong. If a student is unable to recognize that, then he/she needs to go back a few grades.
This appears to be the case with the “answers” Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams came up with. Worse, the mainstream media and Nature editors could not even recognize the absurd dimensions of their claims. This is the sad state that the media and communicators of science have devolved to. The journal Nature has degenerated to a tabloid level.
The claims made by Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams are so far out in left field that even notoriously warmist scientists such as Gavin Schmidt are embarrassed about them, and have publicly dismissed them in no uncertain terms.

The New York Times’ Andrew Revkin titled his blog commentary: “Arctic Methane Credibility Bomb“.
Judith Curry here called the claims “impossible”.
German energy think-tanker and warmist Oliver Geden tweeted: “We’ll see more of these hypes until #COP21“.
Geden reveals what this is really all about. It is not about sloppy quality control at Nature, but rather it’s about having thrown all quality standards overboard so that even highly imaginative fantasies about the future can find their way into the pages of Nature. It’s a last desperate attempt by catastrophe-obsessed ideologues to get attention for a dying narrative.
For some media, what appears in a once prestigious journal must still be good enough to pass on as news for the public without any scrutiny, just as Christoph Seidler of Spiegel demomnstrates. The flagship German news magazine gladly disseminated the outlandish apocalyptic claims as hard scientific news, even calling the result “a dizzying figure: it corresponds to the total annual world economic output.”

"The National Trust has reported that the seasonal activities of plants and animals in the UK have been exceptionally early in 2014. Spring and summer have come early – and observations from some parts of the country even suggest that typical autumn events, such as the development of beech nuts and hawthorn berries, are already in evidence. But, to understand effects on our wildlife, a longer view is needed. It’s clear from events recorded on the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar that the 2014 spring was indeed far in advance of 2013, which was one of the coldest on record. Not all the data is yet in, but for many events, such as the first flowering of bluebells or first sighting of peacock butterflies, average dates were between two and four weeks ahead of last year. Naturally, as the weather has continued to remain warm, it may follow that subsequent activity would also be ahead of schedule. However, it is unwise to make too many assumptions based on anecdotal evidence when looking ahead. As yet Nature’s Calendar has received no data on the first autumn indicators such as ripe blackberries or rowan berries. The average date for the first sighting of ripe blackberries historically tends to be well into August.  This is a great opportunity for people to keep an eye out for these first signs and help track the arrival of autumn. However there is still plenty of opportunity for the weather to change dramatically. It’s still even possible that autumn 2014 will arrive later than average. The events of 2013 and 2014 are a small part of longer-term changes in our natural environment. Colleagues and I at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology recently led a study that gathered together more than 25,000 long-term data sets on the timing of seasonal events for more than 700 species of plants and animals. The study considered a diverse array of organisms including plankton, plants, insects, amphibians, fish, birds and mammals.  Between 1976 and 2005, we found that most seasonal events had shifted their timing so that they now occur earlier in the year than they did just a few decades ago. We know from other studies that average flowering dates for a variety of plant species in Britain have been earlier in the past 20-30 years than at any other point in the last 250 years. Although it is clear that the biological seasons have been shifting in recent decades, not all species have shown the same degree of change in their seasonal activities. The CEH study showed that changes have been most rapid for many organisms at the bottom of food chains, such as plants and the animals that feed upon them. Predators, however, showed slower overall changes in the seasonal timing of their life-cycle events. This general pattern was mirrored in a recent [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12326/abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12326/abstract) comparing changes in fish spawning times and seasonal peaks in plankton food resources in England’s largest lake, Windermere. This is important because, for many animals, the seasonal timing of reproduction is often matched to the time of year when food supply increases – so that offspring receive enough food to survive. If predators cannot keep pace with changes in the seasonal pattern of prey availability then their breeding success may falter and populations may decline.  It’s important to know whether these changes pose a threat to plant and animal populations, and we are already examining the evidence for such impacts in birds. A key question to study is whether animals higher up the food chain will be able to adapt to these changes in order to ensure survival. So, while year-to-year changes are noteworthy, it is the longer-term patterns, and knock-on effects, that are key to understanding how our wildlife will ultimately respond to changes in the seasons. Indeed, 2014 has been an interesting year to date – but the jury is still out on whether we will see more, or fewer, such years in the future. This article was co-authored by Chris Hickman from The Woodland Trust."

 **Albert-Eden Local Board (Maungawhau Subdivision)**



 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some however a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Maungawhau Subdivision**



There are 8 candidates for this 4 seat subdivision of the Albert-Eden Local Board. You may cast up to 4 votes in this FPP contest



 **Linda Cassells –** City Vision **$$**



Linda likes to get things done. That’s great, depending on the things.



She has served on the Council of the Publishers Association of New Zealand. 



The book publishing sector experienced a “severe digital disruption to distribution channels in 2013-14” but has since rebounded. 



“PANZ enjoins the government to work closely with us and our partners (such as Booksellers NZ, the NZ Book Council, Copyright Licensing NZ, the NZ Society of Authors and WeCreate) to support the creative sector contribution to New Zealand’s cultural and economic wellbeing.” 



Cassells has also worked as a literary advisor to Creative New Zealand.



Her candidate profile states: “My top priorities are restoring our environment, even better parks, and building a stronger, more vibrant community through libraries, cultural and arts projects, and thriving local businesses.



I am a lifelong lover of books and reading…”



Guess we can see where she will be sending Albert-Eden Local Board’s share of funding. Guess it is up to you to decide whether that is a worthwhile project. Personally I think cultural and arts projects should stand on their own two feet (through market demand or private philanthropy) or not at all.



 **Lee Corrick – C &R – **Communities and Residents **$$$**



Corrick is an incumbent who has contributed to the Local Board’s unhealthy obsession with historical preservation. When I say unhealthy, I don’t mean historical preservation is bad, I mean Local Boards sticking their beaks into private property owners’ business is.



As an incumbent, Corrick must take some responsibility for the shambles of an upgrade in Mt Albert village which I covered during the rating of [Albert-Eden-Puketapapa’s ward race.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/494908/) When the Chair of AT says, at the opening, it was a “job not well done”, that is disastrous. 



Her priorities over the next three years focus on high standards in “community facilities and parks, improved pedestrian safety…and to strengthen community networks. I enjoy working alongside the community to navigate the often-confusing council processes.”



Everything I could want from a local board member.



 **Yeshe Dawa –** City Vision **$**



Dawa, like me, is part of Generation Rent. A Local Board member’s salary isn’t going to change that.



She wants to see more affordable housing options (which she can do nothing about aside from advocacy). Speaking of things Local Board members can do nothing about, she also wants to take action against climate change.



 **Peter Haynes –** City Vision ****



After several failed attempts to be elected to council as Cathy Casey’s running mate, she has ditched the prehistoric moaning minnie for someone who wants to increase rates but doesn’t know why.



Why is Hayne’s prehistoric? His obsession with preserving volcanic rock walls regardless of whether they’re on public or private property is dangerous.



Moaning Minnie? When a busy local supermarket refurbished and expanded, the Herald asked him for comment:



 _Peter Haynes, Albert Eden Local Board chairman, complained about the store growing so much._



 _“I know that I’m not the only person in my neighbourhood – Mt Eden/Balmoral – who preferred the supermarket as it was and who now finds that there’s a lot more walking required to do the same shop,” Haynes said._



 _But he is happy with the Valley Rd basalt rock wall which was a local victory._



 _“I doubt very much whether they would have thought of the rock wall,” he said referring to Countdown “but they were very happy to incorporate that into their plans._



 _“As it is, I think that the rock wall shows very tangibly a concern for the local, and will be perceived that way by the local people.”_



 _Demolition of two residences on the site was also initially opposed by some locals due to heritage value and the encroachment of commercial into a residential area, Haynes said, and questions were raised about a big car park expansion._



 _Auckland Council found the building had little heritage value, Haynes said._  




As the chairman of the Local Board, Haynes must take full responsibility for their investigations of private property for historic value, without the owner’s consent or knowledge.



The Albert Eden Local Board 2017 plan states:  




 _“Our iconic villas and rock walls date back to the 19th century and give our suburbs their unique character. You have told us you are concerned that heritage features such as these are not being preserved appropriately. We will work with private owners to encourage restoration and maintenance. We will continue to advocate for protection (sic) of relevant sites through heritage provisions in town planning and development activity._



 _“Challenges • Many of our heritage buildings and natural features are on privately-owned land.”_



If you are a property owner, Peter Haynes presents a clear and present danger to your property rights. Despite being elected Chairman of the Local Board, he only just scraped in during the 2016 election by 96 votes. You have an excellent chance to be rid of him in 2019.



 **Rachel Langton – C &R – **Communities & Residents **$$$$$**



Langton has served on the local board for 6 years and was the highest polling candidate in 2016. She has ten years of experience as a lawyer, in employment and local government law. That’s got to be darn useful.



She claims her successes include championing the Potters Park redevelopment (I agree, it looks great) and the sporting facility upgrades at Windmill and Nicholson Parks.  
  
Whether she had nothing to do with the Mt Albert village upgrade or is simply too embarrassed to mention it, I’m unsure. 



**Benjamin Lee – C &R – **Communities and Residents **$$$$**



Incumbent member. With an engineering degree, he should be capable of making meaningful contributions to transport and infrastructure solutions.



Lee is at least honest about the limitations of being a local board member. He will **advocate** for putting Eden Park on a financially sustainable path (I hope that means sending Helen Clark into exile on Little Barrier Island) and setting up residents parking schemes in the suburbs.



That’s a good idea.



 **Bernadette Power –** City Vision **$$**



Power backs practical, safe ways for families to travel between home and work, having seen how “community-led initiatives like the Walking School Bus create strong neighbourhood networks, while getting kids to school safely.” She must also know that these Walking School Buses are administered by Auckland Transport, not the Local Board. Guess she just ran out of room to write that in her profile (149/150 words – fair enough).



She has plenty of experience working on large scale transport projects in Sydney and Auckland which would give her a solid knowledge of best practice transport infrastructure.



That knowledge will be largely wasted on Local Board, restricted to haranguing Auckland Transport rather than, say working for them.



 **Kendyl Smith – C &R – **Communities and Residents **$$$**



Kendyl is a nooby to local politics. What she has done prior includes pioneering the ‘Attitude’ programme for The Parenting Place, which teaches life skills.



Her goals for Local Board are appropriate:



 _“I want to see good use of public space, strong and safe communities, sensible solutions for traffic congestion and thriving businesses. Our community is a great place to live but could be even better.”_



Sensible.  




 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** You have up to 4 votes in this FPP contest

"Energy-generating solar panels provide the opportunity to generate low-carbon electricity from the roof over your head, at a cost that has fallen dramatically and continues to slide. So many governments worldwide have promoted the technology through policies such as net metering, feed-in tariffs and subsidies which have helped the use of solar energy to blossom over the past five years. However, rooftop solar panels, or photovoltaics (PV), require a large, unshaded, south-facing roof to generate maximum returns in Britain and similar countries in the northern hemisphere. As these are all things associated with a premium quality property, some have argued that solar energy subsidies simply provide already wealthy homeowners with a means to reduce their bills and generate income by selling energy back to the grid, at the expense of poorer households in rented flats next door.  A solar photovoltaic system can cost upwards of £6,000 but can earn the homeowner around £750 per year for the next 20 years in savings on energy bills and payments from incentives. This is particularly pertinent in the UK where subsidy payments, known as the feed-in tariff which ensures a good economic return for PV installations and is responsible for driving the growth of Britain’s PV industry, are paid through a levy on all consumers’ bills. When feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2010, it was envisioned this would lead to the annual household energy bill rising by £8 (where the average household bill is around £1,300 per year). So is this a government regressive tax? Not necessarily.  Various ways of taking advantage of solar power have arisen in the years since. Those with money but without a roof of their own can invest in solar power companies to reap the benefits. Community energy co-operatives such as Brixton Energy pool people’s cash in order to install solar panels on community roofs such as schools or sports centres, or local charities, providing each with extra income. The Solar Schools project for example asks local communities to donate toward installing PVs on school roofs, in order to provide a steady income for the school for the next 20 years. Crowdfunding has been the latest trend in clean energy investment and a number of ventures have used this method of raising seed capital in the UK and abroad. Through firms such as Abundance Generation anyone can invest as little as £5 into a renewable energy project, taking advantage of the high rates of return that renewable projects currently offer. For those with a roof but no money, sourcing finance for renewable energy projects has become easier. Even Ikea has started offering PV systems and the finance packages to afford them. Alternatively, companies such as ISIS Solar offer the equipment for free, lowering the homeowners’ bills and taking the feed-in tariff payments in return.  This has tempted the likes of housing associations and local authorities, as they can greatly reduce their tenants’ bills while also hitting their carbon emission reduction targets – without any up-front investment on their part. But what about those who live in a private rented flat and have no roof to offer nor money to invest? This is where the real value of distributed energy comes in, because through community energy co-operatives the benefits from distributed electricity generation can be shared. Brixton Energy, for example, adds a fraction of the profits from their rooftop solar projects to a community fund to pay for energy efficiency measures, advice and workshops to tackle fuel poverty and boost the cash-saving possibilities for the entire community. A greater adoption of solar power brings other benefits beyond clean electricity. A study by the Buildings Research Establishment found that the solar power industry in the UK employed 14,000 people in 2013. You could call that the equivalent of 20 jobs per megawatt of installed rooftop solar power capacity.  Another study that examined the case in the US found that PV systems employ more than double the number of people per megawatt of electricity generated than any other source of renewable energy – and far more than any fossil fuel. Because these jobs are also distributed among communities, the workers’ earnings are ploughed back into several local economies rather than into a single town which might be, for example, the site of a large power plant.  The cash saved by lowering electricity bills and earned from the feed-in tariff is also more likely to be spent within the local economy. By comparison, the profits of large multinational energy companies may be taken out of town or indeed entirely overseas by foreign shareholders.  So a subsidy for solar power doesn’t have to be a subsidy for the rich. Rooftop solar can help grow local economies, provide local jobs and increase local spending. At the same time it can provide a bulwark against energy poverty through the work of community energy co-operatives and installations that provide power to social housing. Photovoltaics are nothing less than a democratising force on the energy supply system – but this requires people, communities and companies to act together to make the most of it."
"There are serious challenges to global food supply everywhere we look. Intensive use of fertilisers in the US Midwest is causing nutrients to run off into rivers and streams, degrading the water quality and causing a Connecticut-size dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Chocolate production will soon be challenged in West Africa – home to over half of global production. A variety of nutritional impacts are predicted due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide – including decreased protein content in food, which has a potential to exacerbate malnutrition. And this is just a very small sample of the risks to the food supply chain that are foreseen. The future of food then, may sound rather bleak. But this does not have to be the case. The food system could become part of the solution for environmental challenges, if we make some changes to it. It could also be an instrument of human health, well-being, dignity, and livelihood – rather than the opposite. But this won’t happen without a radical rethink of our food systems and consumption patterns across the globe – particularly within the context of our cities. Upwards of 75% of the global north’s population is urbanised and the global south is rapidly moving in this direction. Strategies for how these city regions can be fed using more local resources are crucial. Those living in the urban global north are very comfortable with having any foods desired available at any point across the calendar year. This comes at a high cost. Foods transported by air cause nearly four times the CO₂ released compared to truck and 38 times that of a comparable amount transported by rail. Biodiversity and ecosystem loss threatens food production – and meanwhile, agriculture is a key driver of this loss. Furthermore, excessive water use for export agriculture in water-stressed areas can negatively impact local food and livelihoods – for example to secure large quantities of avocados for global north markets.

      How urban farmers are learning to grow food without soil or natural light


 If we are to avoid some of these crises, we need to re-imagine where our food comes from and move, at least in part, towards more seasonal diets with a lower use of land and a serious reduction in global trade – especially for fruits, vegetables, and protein. We can do all of this by addressing eight factors that have exacerbated and reinforced environmental disasters in our food systems. It is especially important that meat consumption and excess calories in countries with high levels of meat consumption and obesity are reduced. Consuming far less meat provides the greatest ability to feed more people with less land  within the US, for example, where meat consumption is particularly high. Every global study of diet and greenhouse gases indicates that reduced meat consumption is the biggest driver of reducing greenhouse gas release via dietary change. Approximately 1.1m hectares of excess corn production are needed to produce the excess calories consumed by just Americans annually. Greater organic and agroecological strategies should be prioritised over highly industrialised farming practices. These forms of farming use much less fertiliser – which is not only bad for biodiversity but also produces high emissions. In 2011, agriculture in my home state of Michigan collectively purchased about 200,000 metric tons of nitrogen fertiliser at a CO₂ cost of 1.34 million metric tons (the equivalent of that produced by 291,000 US cars in a year). Meanwhile, organic bread wheat production in the UK appears to use less energy per ton than conventional production, with very little of it accrued from nitrogen fertiliser production and use. Large quantities of food are needed for any city region – an American city region of a million people will require about 900m kg of food annually. Although “food miles” are problematic as a discriminator for greenhouse gas release, shorter supply chains are probably more amenable to electric vehicle transportation than long-distance transport – and hence ultimately to renewable energy use. As such, cities should aim to source their food from the surrounding region rather than globally. Within city regions it should also be possible to use waste recycling more robustly, creating carbon cycles as well as biogeochemical cycles for plant nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Since phosphorus is essential and non-renewable while production of nitrogen fertilisers requires a great input of energy this is very useful. Although food is lost throughout the supply chain, it’s estimated the greatest losses occur at the consumer level in the global north. In addition, a large amount of produce is wasted for not meeting retail cosmetic standards. All of the energy towards production, transportation, and processing of this food is also wasted. This modern culture of waste must be addressed. Some crops are grown in an intensely concentrated manner, which leaves them vulnerable to climate changes and pests. For example, over half of US fresh produce and nuts are grown in California, and a number of these crops will be negatively impacted this century. While there is research to develop more drought and heat tolerant varieties across a range of crops, it also seems prescient to distribute production more broadly. Variations in weather patterns can make this a challenge. But structures such as poly tunnels can markedly expand the season – to 12 months for lettuce and an additional two-to-three months for tomatoes. And a number of crops, for example apples, can be stored fresh for several months with controlled atmosphere storage. Making negative effects (or costs) of production (such as soil loss) transparent so that all costs are accounted for and then rewarding farmers for things such as soil carbon sequestration, minimised external inputs, and low energy use instead of just total production would greatly help reduce these impacts. The idea of farming insects and jellyfish are just some examples of the innovative suggestions that have been made for diversifying protein sources beyond meat and, say, soya. This would allow for reduced levels of animal protein in the global north and increased levels in much of the global south.

      Bug burgers, anyone? Why we’re opening the UK’s first insect restaurant


 Very little of the global north’s enormous farm policy budgets tend to be spent on policies such as conservation, agroecological research, and organic production. Policies that stimulate new farmer development, regional market and supply chain development (such as food hubs), prioritise appropriate technology development at smaller scales and price points (including robotics), sustainable energy production and research to minimise external inputs while maintaining high productivity are needed in order to help propel their development. All in all, much more attention needs to be paid on the sustainability of the planet’s urban food systems. If the situation continues unchanged, our food supply chains will soon be in deep trouble."

Before the red blooded meat eating, beer and whiskey brigade have conniptions about my choice of website for this disclosure, let me assure you that good vegan food is very appealing and healthy despite the well-bandied-unhealthy-vegan-walking-advertisements for why you should not go there. 



And just to be clear – veganism is the new black in food – super trendy – but eating vegan just to be in vogue does not fly with me. In fact, I despise the Hollywood beautiful who condemn meat eaters for their support of “cruelty to animals”. I think they’ve been watching too many Halal killings and I suspect vegan eating is simply a healthy way to keep their weight down for the next all important movie with bonus PR for joining the politically correct climate change set.



I do not buy into forgoing meat to save the planet as PETA suggests under the heading “Fight Climate Change by Going Vegan”. 



If you’re serious about protecting the environment, the most important thing that you can do is stop eating meat, eggs, and dairy “products”.



Absolute rubbish! Climate change is by no means a proven scientific disaster. The real reason I enjoy vegan food is very simple and non-political – done well it tastes soooo good. I love staying with my vegan family and eating their vegan food because, well, the food is just so damn good, it’s varied and delicious. In fact, I’d swap it out for my humble meaty menu at home any day, but sadly I don’t have the resources, or the inclination, to go fully vegan.



And these days, the nutrition from vegan eating is, in my experience, superior to what you get from the meat and three veg. Here’s a comment from a vegan athlete about getting sufficient daily protein for his muscle repair needs.  




Make sure you include a decent protein source, even if just a little bit, in every meal or snack.



“Mainly, this just keeps you mindful and prevents you from slipping into junk-food-vegan, carbohydrate-only mode. It’s as easy as adding nuts or beans to your salad, protein powder to your smoothie, almond butter on your bagel, or beans to your pasta dish (actually not an inauthentic thing to do in italy). for snacks, eat a handful of nuts, spread some sunflower butter on your apple, make roasted chickpeas, dip a pita in some hummus…all of these add just a little bit of protein, but if you eat two or three snacks a day, it all adds up.” 



  
Vegan food done well is pretty much unbeatable in my book, in terms of attractiveness, taste and nutrition. Much of it is raw, and creativity successfully substitutes the missing meat, dairy, eggs and fish. 



But it’s not easy to produce appealing vegan food – which is why it’s got such a bad rap. That and the concept of roughly chopped raw veg artfully laid on a plate with flowers, fruit and nuts or fake meat is not where good vegan food is at all. Good vegan food has sauces and food combinations to delight the senses. Nuts are used too for vegan milks and cheeses, including Parmesan, and jackfruit and sweet potato replicates the texture of meat.



Vegan desserts are delicious and some of the richest, most decadent you will ever taste. You’d never recognise the lack of eggs and cream.



In truth, I’m a lazy cook – not clever or resourceful enough to reproduce the texture and flavour of good vegan food, so I don’t even bother to try. Plus, it’s time consuming soaking beans and all the rest, and then you’ve got to invest in a myriad of spices, sauces and condiments. 



I regard veganism as a new religion, requiring huge dedication and commitment. It’s more than just substituting fake chicken or mince, it’s using a variety of ingredients in a cunning fashion that awakens all the senses, including the palate.



To motivate yourself into the vegan mindset you could watch “Cowspiracy” or “73 Cows”, but I refuse to because, quite frankly, I like eating cows – and pigs and fish and chickens… sorry, they are not my friends – they are my food. Actually, I never met the animals before they became my food, so any moral dilemma is solved right there.



My extended family sigh when hosting the vegans, serving up their bewilderingly bland salad and boiled veg while quietly sniggering about people stupid enough to refuse the hero of their meal, which is always the meat. I don’t bother explaining that good vegan food is an art, and their tasteless offerings would never make the vegan cut in a month of Sunday roasts. There are some things best left unsaid in the interests of maintaining good family relationships.



But I cannot lie, there is nothing quite as good as sneaking out for a crisp, crunchy BLT in the middle of my vegan eating stint. In my part-time vegan world, I happily allow myself the best of both worlds – a foot in both camps. Live and let live, I say – unless you are my food, of course. Also, I’m not abandoning my commitment to our farmers, traditionally the backbone of the economy and hopefully will be for a long time to come.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
After I published my previous post, “An Observational Estimate of Climate Sensitivity“, a number of people objected that I was just looking at the average annual cycle. On a time scale of decades, they said, things are very different, and the climate sensitivity is much larger. So I decided to repeat my analysis without using the annual averages that I used in my last post. Figure 1 shows that result for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH):
Figure 1. Temperatures calculated using solely the variations in solar input (net solar energy after albedo reflections). The observations are so well matched by the calculations that you cannot see the lines showing the observations, because they are hidden by the lines showing the calculations. The two hemispheres have different time constants (tau) and climate sensitivities (lambda). For the NH, the time constant is 1.9 months, and the climate sensitivity is 0.30°C for a doubling of CO2. The corresponding figures for the SH are 2.4 months and 0.14°C for a doubling of CO2.
I did this using the same lagged model as in my previous post, but applied to the actual data rather than the averages. Please see that post and the associated spreadsheet for the calculation details. Now, there are a number of interesting things about this graph.

First, despite the nay-sayers, the climate sensitivities I used in my previous post do an excellent job of calculating the temperature changes over a decade and a half. Over the period of record the NH temperature rose by 0.4°C, and the model calculated that quite exactly. In the SH, there was almost no rise at all, and the model calculated that very accurately as well.
Second, the sun plus the albedo were all that were necessary to make these calculations. I did not use aerosols, volcanic forcing, methane, CO2, black carbon, aerosol indirect effect, land use, snow and ice albedo, or any of the other things that the modelers claim to rule the temperature. Sunlight and albedo seem to be necessary and sufficient variables to explain the temperature changes over that time period.
Third, the greenhouse gases are generally considered to be “well-mixed”, so a variety of explanations have been put forward to explain the differences in hemispherical temperature trends … when in fact, the albedo and the sun explain the different trends very well.
Fourth, there is no statistically significant trend in the residuals (calculated minus observations) for either the NH or the SH.
Fifth, I have been saying for many years now that the climate responds to disturbances and changes in the forcing by counteracting them. For example, I have held that the effect of volcanoes on the climate is wildly overestimated in the climate models, because the albedo changes to balance things back out.
We are fortunate in that this dataset encompasses one of the largest volcanic eruptions in modern times, that of Pinatubo … can you pick it out in the record shown in Figure 1? I can’t, and I say that the reason is that the clouds respond immediately to such a disturbance in a thermostatic fashion.
Sixth, if there were actually a longer time constant (tau), or a larger climate sensitivity (lambda) over decade-long periods, then it would show up in the NH residuals but not the SH residuals. This is because there is a trend in the NH and basically no trend in the SH. But the calculations using the given time constants and sensitivities were able to capture both hemispheres very accurately. The RMS error of the residuals is only a couple tenths of a degree.
OK, folks, there it is, tear it apart … but please remember that this is science, and that the game is to attack the science, not the person doing the science.
Also, note that it is meaningless to say my results are a “joke” or are “nonsense”. The results fit the observations extremely well. If you don’t like that, well, you need to find, identify, and point out the errors in my data, my logic, or my mathematics.
All the best,
w.
PS—I’ve been told many times, as though it settled the argument, that nobody has ever produced a model that explains the temperature rise without including anthropogenic contributions from CO2 and the like … well, the model above explains a 0.5°C/decade rise in the ’80s and ’90s, the very rise people are worried about, without any anthropogenic contribution at all.
[UPDATE: My thanks to Stephen Rasey who alertly noted below that my calculation of the trend was being thrown off slightly by end-point effects. I have corrected the graphic and related references to the trend. It makes no difference to the calculations or my conclusions. -w.]
[UPDATE: My thanks to Paul_K, who pointed out that my formula was slightly wrong.  I was using
∆T(k) = λ ∆F(k)/τ + ∆T(k-1) * exp(-1 / τ)
when I should have been using
∆T(k) = λ ∆F(k)(1 – exp(-1/ τ)) + ∆T(k-1) * exp(-1 / τ)
The result of the error is that I have underestimated the sensitivity slightly, while everything else remains the same. Instead of the sensitivities for the SH and the NH being 0.04°C per W/m2 and 0.08°C per W/m2 respectively, the correct sensitivities should have been 0.05°C per W/m2 and 0.10°C per W/m2.

"It will be very difficult to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enough to halt global heating at 1.5°C – the threshold at which catastrophic climate change becomes more likely – according to a new paper published in Nature.  If the Earth warms by more than 1.5°C, millions of people could be displaced by sea level rise and global crop yields could decline. Fortunately, political will to prevent this seems more widespread than ever. The UK recently became the first major economy to pass a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 into law. Sounds positive, so what’s the problem? Well, the new study has shown that if the world continues to use its existing power plants, it’s likely that the target of 1.5°C will be exceeded. If all the fossil fuel plants and other carbon-emitting infrastructure that’s currently planned are built, this target will certainly be exceeded. There is a significant number of fossil fuel plants currently operating worldwide. Their continued use would mean enough greenhouse gas emitted to overrun the carbon budget for keeping world temperature rise below 1.5°C.  Excluding all other sources of emissions, the infrastructure that’s currently operational and planned to go into use within the next decade would consume two thirds of the world’s carbon budget for limiting warming to 2°C. People have known about the dangers of climate change since at least the 1980s, but even so, the age of many fossil fuel energy plants currently operating worldwide is striking. Almost half of these power stations – running on coal, oil and gas – were commissioned after 2004. The Kyoto Protocol to limit greenhouse gas emissions came into force in 2005. The world is now committed to emissions from these plants unless they’re closed early. Even stopping the construction of new fossil fuel power stations won’t be enough to meet the target of 1.5°C. Capturing and storing the carbon dioxide (CO₂) these plants produce would also help, but this technology is needed on an industrial scale in almost every power plant to make a substantial impact. At the moment, there are only 21 in operation or in construction in the whole world. There are plans for more, and in the UK there are plans to capture carbon from a chemical plant in Cheshire and from Drax, the UK’s biggest power plant. But previous plans for carbon capture and storage at Drax were scrapped in 2015.

      Glue could be the magic ingredient for cheap and efficient CO₂ capture


 Drax currently runs 50% on biomass – organic material, such as wood or other crop plants. It’s considered a renewable fuel as the timescale to produce it is relatively short. The carbon emitted from biomass is absorbed when the plants are growing and released when they’re burnt for energy. In this way, the technology is said to be a “net-zero” carbon emitter. This could be part of the solution for reducing emissions, but the life cycle impacts of any energy solution need to be fully understood. If they aren’t, there’s a risk that more environmental problems could emerge. Closing fossil fuelled power plants might be possible in some countries, but the difference in the average age of these plants across the globe is stark. Coal-fired power stations in China and India are on average just over ten years old. In the US and the European Union, the average age is over 30 years. The paper shows that the world’s newer plants are in countries where electricity demand is growing – it’s less likely they’ll be able to close them soon. Existing electricity and industry infrastructure accounts for just under 80% of committed emissions – that is, those emissions that will come from the infrastructure that’s already in use. It might seem that the easy solution would be to just stop using it. But even as we commit to net zero emissions by 2050 in the UK, we’re supporting fossil fuel projects overseas and cutting funding for renewable technologies. The new study shows that if the UK is serious about meeting our commitments, we cannot continue like this. The study’s authors believe that the world has a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5°C of warming if governments do two things. First, prohibit all new infrastructure that emits CO₂, including those which are proposed but haven’t been built. Second, retire existing infrastructure in industry and energy as soon as possible. Without these changes, the authors say, the goals adopted in the Paris Agreement are already in jeopardy. Fossil fuel-powered plants that can’t be closed need to be coupled with carbon capture and storage technology.  As climate emergencies are declared, this paper outlines the level of commitment that’s needed by everyone to deliver radical emission reductions. Without fundamental change to the current situation, our global climate will warm beyond 1.5°C. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

NASA Discovers Unprecedented Blooms of Ocean Plant Life…
“Part of NASA’s mission is pioneering scientific discovery, and this is like finding the Amazon rainforest in the middle of the Mojave Desert,” said Paula Bontempi, NASA’s ocean biology and biogeochemistry program manager in Washington.
Or maybe it’s more like finding a lot of trees in a part of the Amazon rainforest where you never bothered to look for trees before. Sub-ice phytoplankton blooms are not exactly “unprecedented.”

Dense sub-ice bloom of dinoflagellates in the Baltic Sea, potentially limited by high pH

Abstract
The phytoplankton community, carbon assimilation, chlorophyll a (Chl a), pH, light and attenuation and inorganic nutrients were monitored under the ice in the coastal Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Maximum ice and snow thickness was 40 and 15 cm, respectively. Freshwater influence had created a halocline 1–2 m below the ice–water interface, and above this halocline, a dense bloom of dinoflagellates developed (max: >300 μg Chl a L−1). The photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide by this “red tide” increased the pH to a maximum of 9.0. The sub-ice phytoplankton community was dominated by the dinoflagellate Woloszynskia halophila (max: 3.6 × 107 cells L−1). The pH tolerance of this species was studied in a monoculture and the results indicate that pH >8.5 limits growth of this species at ambient irradiance. This study shows that primary productivity may raise the pH to growth limiting levels, even in marine, low-light environments where pH normally is not considered important.

INTRODUCTION
The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed, brackish ocean where ice is an important element of the ecosystem during winter. In the northern part of Baltic Sea and western part of Gulf of Finland, the probability of freezing is >90% and ice coverage normally lasts for 2–6 months (Mälkki and Tamsalu, 1985). There have been observations of dense, dinoflagellate dominated blooms under the ice in the Baltic Sea, but there is relatively little information about this phenomenon (Larsen et al., 1995; Haecky et al., 1998; Kremp and Heiskanen, 1999). These types of blooms are often called red tides because of the obvious discoloration of the water, but a cold-water red tide is very much in contrast to the main distribution and bloom patterns of dinoflagellates, which typically avoid winter and spring in temperate areas (Smayda and Reynolds, 2001).

"Iraq has a long and rich heritage, home for thousands of years to mighty empires – Assyria and Babylon, the Abbasid caliphate – that ruled the region once known as Mesopotamia, widely held as the cradle of western civilisation and as a major centre of classical Islam. The region is thick with history, and historical artefacts. But when in June the extremist Sunni group ISIS took over swathes of northern Iraq, within a day or two of taking Mosul the group issued edicts which included orders to destroy Shiite graves and shrines and other ancient relics – orders which appear to have been carried out, with six sites destroyed. Rumour and fears over the possible fate of the region’s even more ancient cultural heritage under this heavy-handed new regime have filled the gap since.  And there is much to lose. In the desert 100km southwest of Mosul lies Hatra, an Arab city of the Roman period rather like its more famous sisters Palmyra, Petra and Baalbeck. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site with fabulous stone temples and statues (the originals now mostly in the Iraq Museum). Mosul was heartland of the Assyrian Empire, which ruled the Middle East  in the first millennium BC. Huge ruin mounds of ancient cities such as Ashur, Nimrud, and Nineveh follow the course of the Tigris river from Qalaat Sherqat up to Mosul and beyond. Since the mid-19th century its palaces and temples have furnished museums worldwide with monumental stone carvings of winged bulls and lions, and scenes of military conquest. Tens of thousands of cuneiform clay tablets, the majority now in the British Museum in London or the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, provide unparallelled insight into the workings of empire nearly 3,000 years ago. The region is still dense with churches and monasteries from its time as a centre of Christian learning in the first millennium AD, which house important manuscript libraries as well as some of the last speakers of Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus and the disciples. Although the last remaining Jewish inhabitants left the region in the 1950s, the Jewish community had first settled there as deportees from Assyria in the 8th century BC. Mosul remained important during the Islamic period too. It was a centre of resistance against the crusaders – Saladin ruled from here – and home to eminent poets, scientists and men of letters. Many medieval buildings, both secular and sacred, survive to this day. But what do we know about these developments, what can we expect, and can and should the rest of the world do about it? It is almost impossible to get verifiable news out of Mosul at the moment. The province goes for long periods without electricity or suffers communications blackouts. It is difficult to get through to colleagues by phone or by email. ISIS itself, however, is very adept at exploiting social media. The internet is filled with claims and counterclaims which makes it almost impossible to document reliably what is really happening. However,  websites such as Conflict Antiquities and Gates of Nineveh are both keeping track as best they can. The Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology has for three years documented the looting and destruction of cultural heritage in the occupied regions Iraq’s western neighbour, including a few isolated examples of iconoclastic smashing of ancient Assyrian statuary. It has been reported that sales of looted antiquities have helped to fund ISIS in Syria although, again, hard facts are hard to come by. The understandable concern is that similar events will unfold in northern Iraq, although there is no evidence of it yet. While the experience in Syria suggests it is very likely, the historical evidence from within Iraq during the 1990s and 2000s reveals a different picture. During that time there were isolated instances of thefts from Assyrian archaeological sites for sale on the world market. Thanks to thorough archaeological documentation, however, it was possible to identify and repatriate stolen objects. Likewise, in the current situation, documented artefacts from museums and archaeological sites could all be potentially identified and recoverable if they were looted and smuggled out of the country. But objects dug from as yet unexcavated sites are much harder to provenance. The tragedy is that however many thousands of artefacts are found attractive and durable enough for sale to make the pillaging worthwhile, many many more – and all of their archaeological context – will have been irreversibly destroyed in the process. The remoteness of desert sites in southern Iraq meant it was relatively straightforward to dig for Sumerian and Babylonian antiquities in the 1990s and 2000s. However, the Assyrian sites of northern Iraq have remained relatively untouched, so far. But 2014 is not 1991 or 2003, and ultimately it is impossible to predict what will happen. International treaties such the 1970 UNESCO convention against the illicit sale of cultural property,supported by national legislation, have drastically curtailed worldwide sales of Iraqi antiquities in the past ten years. But this has also driven the market underground, from where it is even harder to track stolen artefacts.  Why should we care about the fate of a few ancient statues and buildings? Is it not a first world indulgence to worry about preserving culture while people suffer and die? On the contrary, culture and people are inseparable: it is individuals and communities who create culture, culture that brings people together in meaningful, creative and constructive ways. Culture is the glue that holds societies together. It is a fundamental part of being human, living together.  We all have a duty to protect and celebrate Iraq’s multi-faceted cultural heritage, now and for future generations. It matters deeply to many Iraqis – and to many of the rest of us – and its fate cannot be separated from the human tragedy that is currently unfolding."
"About a month ago, many people I know on the political left were brimming with the belief that the Covid-19 crisis opened the way for a watershed conversation about deep social change. Now, as the full horror of the UK’s coronavirus experience becomes clearer and we begin to understand an all-enveloping crisis whose effects will be felt for years, that mood seems to have been supplanted by a pained mixture of anxiety and fatalism. On a bad day, our national nightmare now appears so deep and complex as to feel not just depressing, but insurmountable. But from a somewhat unlikely source, there was recently a note of hope. Around the time of the recent VE Day celebrations, the journalist and historian Max Hastings – something of a freethinker, but also someone with a classic establishment background – wrote a piece for the Times. His jumping-off point was the social revolution that began in 1945, but he quickly moved his focus to 2020. “The present crisis seems destined again to change the face of Britain, unleashing demands for social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories,” said this one-time editor of the Daily Telegraph. To him, the immediate future was clear: “The polo season, figuratively speaking, is over.”  But is it? Last week brought the awful symbolism of golf and tennis clubs reopening for business and the employers of nannies being given the green light to bring them back into their homes, just as many of the people told to return to work were grimly crowding on to public transport. On Wednesday, the Telegraph published details of internal Treasury documents proposing a two-year public sector pay freeze; the next day, the Guardian highlighted the huge shortfalls now facing English councils. Boris Johnson may have recently held out the prospect of a post-crisis Britain that would be “more generous and sharing”, but these auguries are hardly promising. And so, as always, attention turns to the Labour party. Judged by the criteria of the weekly political cycle and the ritual of prime minister’s questions, Keir Starmer is so far doing very well indeed. For what such things are worth, his recent net approval rating exceeded Boris Johnson’s, which has seemingly encouraged the age-old Labour belief that the first prerequisite of serious politics is the appearance of measured statesmanship. That is true, as far as it goes. But Labour’s history suggests that a fixation on respectability often blurs into a reluctance to embrace any thinking deemed too adventurous. This instinct may have returned in the wake of a historic election defeat centred on a campaign that presented political ambition as an incoherent splurge, and the kind of radicalism that blurred into the obnoxious fringes of the ultra-left. It is still too early to tell, but the result may yet be a leadership clinging to safety, when the moment will sooner or later demand something much more thoroughgoing. The basics hardly involve a huge leap of imagination: to some extent, they mix what might be salvaged from recent Labour politics with ideas that have long been in circulation way beyond the traditional left. The lives of people at the bottom of most socio-economic hierarchies will soon need to be lastingly improved, perhaps via an initial minimum income guarantee of the kind embraced by the coalition government in Spain. Given that we are unlikely to be able to revive a featherweight labour market based around retail and services, the time ought to be ripe for the economy to be pushed at last towards a green new deal, and the revival of manufacturing. The dysfunctional centralisation of power in England, a blind spot for both the left and right, needs to be reversed; austerity needs to be conclusively nailed as the dogma of self-harm it always is; and we need to deal, at last, with the deep structural racism towards the people most severely affected by the virus. As crucial as all those issues focused on hospitals and care homes remain, the fundamentals of public health are always about much more: the way that institutions often reflect deep-seated prejudice, and basic matters of what some people call political economy. There is rising noise about many of these things. In the last week or so, I have read promising thinking about the politics of the crisis from Medact, which gives a voice to health professionals focused on deep social and economic questions; and from Every Doctor, a campaign focused on the needs of the NHS. The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank is doing strong work about how bailouts for companies should necessitate action on their social responsibilities, and thereby trying to open a conversation about a more moral economy. Green New Deal UK is now pouring its energy into a campaign titled Build Back Better, aimed at a new political settlement that “prioritises people, invests in our NHS and creates a robust, shockproof economy that is capable of tackling the climate crisis”. From 25 May, players including the left pressure group Compass and the New Economics Foundation will launch a new initiative aimed at maintaining the pluralism and spontaneity of all this activity, but somehow channelling its energy into a clear policy platform. Of course, there is still a yawning gap between these efforts and the places where this crisis is most vividly playing out. But in an age in which new political developments can ignite at speed, they ought to give us at least qualified hope. The ideal, perhaps, would be for a new agenda to acquire such momentum that it has to be taken seriously, even by the most cautious politicians, as a question that hangs over us finally demands an answer: if any return to the “normal” that has so horrifically failed us is unthinkable, where does the future begin? • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"
"Some years ago New Yorker magazine printed a cartoon showing a group of high society ladies enjoying an afternoon cup of tea. One lady turns to her neighbour and says, “I don’t know why I don’t care about the bottom of the ocean, but I don’t.” It’s often argued that we know more about the surface of the moon than we do about the bottom of the ocean, and the New York society ladies perfectly reflect the issue – what’s out of sight is out of mind. Does it matter that we know so little about the largest areas on our planet? Does the deep sea do anything for society? Is it important? An eclectic group of scientists, fishing representatives and government policy makers is meeting today in Edinburgh to discuss the future of Scotland’s deep seas. Here in the UK the vast majority of deep-sea territory is to the west of Scotland beneath the Atlantic waters that stretch out to Rockall. From the surface, the grey expanse of the Atlantic hides a seabed that is far from a featureless expanse of sand and mud. The edge of the continental shelf is strewn with rocks dropped from icebergs at the end of the last glaciation.  These rocks provide a perch for corals and sponges to settle and feed, growing into elaborate colonies that can live for hundreds of years. In some places these corals and sponges cover the seabed, forming deep-water coral reefs and sponge fields.  Although these deep-sea habitats have been known since the 19th century oceanographic expeditions led by Edinburgh’s Charles Wyville Thomson, it is only in the past two decades that researchers have begun to uncover their true extent and diversity. Using acoustic technologies borrowed from the military and oil industry, marine scientists can now map the seabed in glorious three-dimensional detail. These surveys are revealing not only the diversity of habitats in Scotland’s deep seas, but they also tell us that many have been damaged.  From linear scars cutting across sonar surveys to photographs of smashed coral colonies, evidence has accumulated not only from Scotland but also Ireland, Norway and beyond that deep-water trawl fishing has damaged and in some cases destroyed deep-sea habitats that have developed since the last ice age 10,000 years ago. But if the fish caught are an essential part of our food security and the populations of deep-sea fish are in good shape, perhaps this is a price worth paying.  The deep seas west of Scotland have been fished for more than 30 years. Populations of deep-water fish have declined. Some deep-sea sharks are now on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List as “endangered” (Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper shark) and “critically endangered” (gulper shark).  Deep-sea fish catches follow characteristic cycles of boom in the early days and bust as the populations are fished down. Why is this? The pace of life in the deep sea is slow. Food rains down from the surface waters and the animals of the deep sea are adapted with slow growth, long lifespans and low rates of reproduction.  For these reasons, the scientific consensus is that for the vast majority of deep-sea fisheries to be sustainable, the harvest rates must be very, very low. Because deep-sea fish live in mixed populations, it is also hard to target any one species of fish without catching others. Neither are deep-sea fish a significant part of food security. The combined catch of fish from the water column and seabed from the seas around Rockall, Bailey and the Faroe-Shetland channel, which are mostly relatively shallow stocks of haddock and monkfish, add up to just 8% of the value of the catch landed in Scotland.  In March 2013 the European Union’s environment committee voted in favour of a proposal to phase out deep-sea bottom trawling and gill net fishing below 200m, but this measure was subsequently rejected by the fisheries committee. In December when put to a vote, the European Parliament was split but narrowly rejected this proposal.  There are a number of reasons for the close nature of the vote. Not all the fish populations taken at 200m depth are in decline. Some are well managed and are important to vulnerable local communities in areas such as the western Highlands. There was also the question that if Europe had completely banned deep-water fishing, would some of the vessels have moved further afield to waters off west Africa, or to international waters where there is little or no regulation? In life there are no simple answers, but we can look for guiding principles and examples of good practice. Good work has been done to create marine protected areas (MPAs) in the deep waters west of Scotland. But these MPAs have been put in place without understanding how the areas are connected ecologically.  The challenges of deep-sea sampling mean that we know very little about how deep-sea animal populations are structured. Larger-scale projects integrating genetics with new models of ocean circulation are needed to fill these major gaps. But perhaps the most important issue is to celebrate the diversity of deep-sea life and share the information beyond the confines of academic journals and dry policy documents.  People don’t care about things they have never seen and know nothing about. But I expect the New York ladies would object noisily if someone suggested bulldozing the pyramids or felling the last few stands of giant redwoods.  The issues of deep-sea fishing and its sustainability are a global concern, and the debate in Europe has reached a critical point. It now remains to be seen if a scientifically credible and politically feasible agreement can be reached that will allow the European Union to show global leadership in managing its share of the largest ecosystem on Earth.  A Sustainable Future for Scotland’s Deep Seas will take place in Edinburgh at Our Dynamic Earth at 6pm on Monday April 28. To register email deepsea@mcsuk.org"
"The plan to use baited traps to catch and kill sharks off the coast of Western Australia caused considerable controversy when it was announced last year, with critics calling the shark cull ineffective, inhumane, and irresponsible.  Now the Western Australian state government has published a review of the trial cull between January and April of this year, and has recommended that it continue until 2017. While the review seeks to address concerns and to allay any misconceptions, it fundamentally supports the continual culling of sharks with no scientific justification. The report states: there is conjecture about the reasons for recent increases in shark attacks in Western Australian water [and] there is currently insufficient evidence to clearly establish a cause. Where then without scientific evidence is the justification to continue culling several shark species, including bull, tiger and great white sharks? The increased spate of shark attacks in the past ten years is cause for concern for the tourism industry. The report argues that the programme aims to enhance public safety by capturing potentially dangerous sharks that come close to popular beaches and surfing spots during summer.  The cull still fails to address the matter of shark species, in particular the great white, which is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  The justification for continuing the culling using drum lines – baited hooks attached to floating, anchored barrels – is questionable. The report provides information on a “comprehensive risk assessment” which concluded that the programme posed “negligible risk to the target species, non-target species of marine fauna and the broader ecosystem.”  Sharks are essential apex predators, ultimately helping to regulate and maintain the balance of marine ecosystems. While they have been mislabelled as ferocious killers, of the 172 sharks caught none were great whites. This seems to be an expensive and unscientific failure, as the report discloses that in the 20 attacks in Western Australia of the past 100 years, great whites have been responsible for 11 It was also thought that the government was aware that numbers of great whites at the time of the project were lower than at other times of the year. The report quotes evidence showing that bull sharks and tiger sharks are responsible for most shark attacks around the world and that the number of unprovoked attacks is rising. Where is the evidence directly related to the Western Australian coasts to back up these statements?  Alarmingly, the report shows consultation meetings were held without including environment groups, due to their position being “already known”. One wonders how there could ever have been a fair and balanced debate if some viewpoints were ignored. The report recommends that trapping and culling recommence in mid-November each year over the period of 2014-2017, in an attempt to capturing large great whites – even though it states that “perhaps the most prevalent criticism of the programme is that it is not based on science”.  Indeed, most of the scientific references used to support the report’s conclusions regarding catching sharks with drum lines and impact on by-catch are too outdated to support any conclusions. More quality research data is required for this, yet the trial has produced little if any. The drum lines have also resulted in casualties beyond just sharks, ensnaring seven rays and one northwest blowfish, but fortunately no turtles, dolphins or whales. The inadequacies in many areas of the report display an inability to recognise the threat we are creating for these vulnerable species at the expense of humans having a “good, shark free holiday” on the beaches of Western Australia. There was a positive note in the review that provides a comprehensive suite of shark hazard mitigation strategies for the future. These include commitments for more research into shark behaviour, shark deterrents and detection, acoustic tagging, aerial patrols, equipment for Surf Life Saving WA, a beach enclosure, beach watchtowers and community awareness initiatives.  Shark hazard mitigation is a complex issue. No clear cause has been established for the increase in attacks – seven deaths in three years between 2010 and 2013. The simplest would be to leave the sharks alone. Humans, if they don’t want to take the risk, shouldn’t go in the water."

Today, in a 62-36 vote, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. The House passed a similar measure a few weeks ago. These actions come more than 6 years after TransCanada Corp originally submitted its application to the State Department to build a pipeline linking the Alberta oil sands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.   
  
Did I say State Department?   
  
Yep, in matters involving the crossing of an international border (in this case the one with Canada) the State Department must make a determination as to whether or not the project is in the “national interest.” Two-thousand, three hundred and twenty-three days later, the ultimate head of the State Department still hasn’t made up his mind.   
  
So Congress has attempted to make the decision for him.   
  
But it probably won’t work.   
  
President Obama has already advertised that he plans on vetoing the measure, because, well, because the State Department already has a procedure in place to handle cross border pipeline projects like this one.   
  
In fact, this procedure has worked flawlessly up until the Keystone XL pipeline. The previous cross-border pipeline that was proposed—the Alberta Clipper in 2007—was approved in just over two years. At the time, the State Department wrote in glowing terms about the project praising it for advancing “strategic interests,” being a “positive economic signal” and adding that “reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are best addressed through each country’s robust domestic policies.”   




In the intervening years, Obama has come to view climate change as a matter of utmost urgency and as a defining issue of his legacy as president. And leading environmentalists have planted it in his head that the Keystone XL pipeline is make or break when it comes to climate change.   
  
It is not.   
  
Keystone XL will have virtually no impact on the global climate now or in the future.   
  
But that doesn’t matter any longer. Instead, the pipeline has become a symbol of climate action, a line in the sand that can’t be crossed if you are truly concerned about climate change and the fate of humanity.   
  
I have repeatedly pointed out that it is in President Obama’s best interest to keep the pipeline in limbo. This way, climate change stays front page news. And with a left-leaning press, this means more coverage playing up the pipeline protests and playing down needless government meddling in private economics.   
  
President Obama has asked interested federal agencies to comment on the Keystone XL pipeline proposal. These comments are due February 2nd. The State Department will then sift through them and consider them and ponder what to do next.   
  
This is what the President will say when he vetos the bill.   
  
The stalling will continue.   
  
And so will the conversation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s version of Britain’s UKIP party is the new AfD Alternative_for_Germany party. The AfD party is the result of Germany’s established parties having stopped listening to its citizens. It takes a position against the euro-currency, the hysterical transition to renewable energies, and has cast considerable doubt over climate science itself.
Now it is being violently assaulted at campaign rallies by green, leftist thugs. Hat-tip: Bernd Felsche at FB.
In the latest incident, the AfD held a campaign rally yesterday in the northern port city of Bremen in order to express ideas and to debate the issues of our time. However, in today’s environmentally radical Germany, expressing alternative ideas and dissent are not welcome. And as yesterday’s event shows, you’re putting your health and life at risk if you do so. Here’s a press release from the Bremen Police Department.
Location: Bremen, 24 August 2013, 15.30. Today, this afternoon, a campaign event by the party ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ took place at the Bremer Bürgerpark. This event was stormed hit-and-run-style by attackers. Multiple persons were injured. At 3 p.m. the campaign event started on an open air stage. During a speech by the chairperson of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland”, the event was suddenly stormed by 20 – 25 partially masked persons. Eight persons succeeded to get onto the stage. The attackers used pepper spray in the stage area. This led to 16 people being injured. When the police intervened the attackers fled the park. During the pursuit one helper of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ was attacked with a knife. He was lightly injured to the hand as he defended himself. All persons who were injured by the pepper spray suffered irritated eyes and respiration. Among the injured were two children aged 7 and 11 and one police officer.  All the injured were treated on site by an ambulance. The injured police officer continued his duty. Three persons (22, 25 and 27 years old) were arrested. They probably can be assigned to the left-wing spectrum. The police investigation is ongoing. The police are investigating for massive disruption of the peace. The event by the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ resumed and ended as planned at 6:30 p.m. Further witnesses are being asked to report to the criminal authorities at (0421) 362-3888.”
Here’s a video of the AfD incident from one angle. Green activists keep writing that the AfD is a party of “racists, right-wing populists and Nazis.” All the middle-aged, honest hardworking folks you see in attendance are viewed by the greens and like-thinkers as “threats“.

Green violence on-stage for the whole world to see. Seven and 11-year old children injured in the planned attack.
So who just were these “left-wing” thug attackers? All the evidence points to one colour: Greens.
Intolerant and aggressive announcements by a number green sites against the AfD party have been mounting in the internet lately. For example, two weeks ago, the website “Gruene Jugend Goettingen” (Green Youths Göttingen) agitated its base by posting: “GRÜNE JUGEND Göttingen calling for protests against the AfD”. One of its members even called on “fighting against the right-wing populists and Nazis as a reason to protest the campaign events of the Alternative for Germany“. This is a new level of intolerance. If one disagrees with the Green movement, then you get defamed as right-wing extremists and Nazis.

Even Germany’s Green Party, which is polling at a formidable 15% in German surveys, is calling on Greens: “Don’t allow the campaign of the AfD any room!“.
Bremen was hardly the first time the AfD has been the target of physical violence by such radicals. The Green Party page continuously portrays the AfD as a “right-wing, extremist, democracy-hostile party” in a propagandist attempt to demonize the AfD, just as Al Gore does so by comparing climate skeptics and Tea Party activists to homophobes, Holocaust deniers, and alcoholics.
Green attacks nationwide
Two weeks ago at a campaign event in Gottingen, the AfD was also attacked by intolerant, violent radicals who “physically assaulted campaign helpers“.  The Hannover Zeitung here reports:
Time and again all over Germany there’s the destruction of Alternative für Deutschland campaign posters and attacks on campaign helpers. For example in Lübeck one quarter of all posters that had been put up were destroyed. […] In Berlin stones were thrown at a truck loaded with AfD posters. Similar attacks also occurred in Giessen and Nuremberg. …”
Green leader Marie Kollenrott denies that the Greens have anything to do with the violence, and blames fringe radicals: “The GREENS reject violence as a means for political debate.” Unfortunately her base doesn’t appear to be listening, and they are becoming increasingly violent and dangerous to Germany’s open society. The constant hate-filled stream of propaganda the German greens put out against the AfD and dissenters incites weak-minded activists to commit acts of violence.  It’s sad that Green leaders are too spiteful to see this.
AfD deputy spokeswoman Frauke Petry says: “The events in Gottingen remind us of the worst time of the Weimar Republic.” Deputy AfD spokesman Konrad Adam adds: “These kinds of incidents should be a concern to everyone. These attacks are on democracy itself.”

"The UK Labour Party recently announced it has created a new shadow minister for climate justice. Danielle Rowley has been appointed to the role and her job, according to press reports, will involve liaising with activist movements. As someone who has studied these groups for 30 years, this raises several intriguing questions for me about the relationship between the government and grassroots environmental movements. The unfolding climate emergency – so dramatically brought to the public’s attention by activist group Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes – provides the immediate context for such an announcement. However, UK society is also suffering from austerity policies that have resulted in more homelessness, child poverty, environmental degradation and so on – all of which are exacerbated by climate change. Any meaningful response to these problems will have to address the climate crisis while also being mindful of social justice. The appointment of a shadow minister for climate justice should be understood in this light. The idea of “climate justice” emerged from grassroots struggles for land and the environment in the developing world. Its advocates combine principles of democratic accountability and participation, ecological sustainability and social justice. In particular, climate justice rejects many current capitalist approaches to climate change such as carbon markets, and argues for keeping remaining fossil fuels in the ground. It poses creative solutions such as renewable energies, localised organic food production and “green” jobs. Any government that wishes to meaningfully address the challenges posed by climate change will need to take seriously a climate justice agenda and be committed to it. The appointment of a shadow minister for climate justice is a belated beginning. However, as fossil fuel extraction continues and the climate crisis deepens, so environmental protests have increased. Some, such as Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes, demand more urgent climate action. Others, such as the anti-fracking campaigns in Lancashire and Yorkshire, highlight the problems that arise when trying to balance ecological and community concerns, business interests and government policy. So what would a climate justice agenda look like? In the UK, it would mean a rapid transition to low or zero-carbon economies and lifestyles. Government policy and investment would focus on renewable energy, more sustainable transport, industry and land-use, as well as an ambitious “green new deal” on employment. It is likely that all this would bring government policy into confrontation with corporate interests and the leverage applied by corporate lobbying, trade unions and political party donations.  It is here that the relationship between the government and environmental movements will be critical. Environmental protest is never only oppositional. The key is always to attempt to transform society, not least by influencing government policy – for example through the promotion of workable alternatives.  Any relationship between grassroots mobilisations and the government – friendly or hostile – will create new arenas of social action. Sometimes that works to promote climate justice alternatives “on the ground”. A good example of this comes from Germany, where grassroots anti-nuclear activism in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the emergence of a renewable energy sector largely controlled by local cooperatives. Sometimes it works to constrain climate justice alternatives – although anti-roads activism in the UK during the 1990s slowed down road building for a while, green transport remains in its infancy. Environmental movements that do collaborate with the state always run the risk that their demands may get appropriated by the existing system in a way that neutralises their transformative potential. Therefore an engagement with the state only makes sense in a situation where a progressive social transformation might actually take place. Otherwise it is pointless. Even if the Labour Party does come to power in the near future, and there is suddenly a serious chance of that progressive social transformation, environmental movements will remain crucial. Pledges made in opposition do not always turn into government policies, and ongoing mobilisations would be required to make sure a Labour government sticks to its promises. In any case, climate justice cannot and should not wait upon the government to act. Grassroots struggles from below will remain a critical force that both create alternatives and, through protest, encourage the state to engage and negotiate. Such a relationship – in essence keeping the government honest – has the potential to enable a serious agenda of climate justice. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel has issued a press release.
In truth it says that the strong warming of 1978 to 1998 is in large part due to Pacific ocean cycles. We can now close the books on the silly CO2 science.
Here is the press release in English (my emphasis):
August 22, 2013/Kiel. Will there be rather warm or cold winters in Germany in the coming years? We may have a long way to go before reliable forecasts of this kind can be achieved. However, marine scientists, under the auspices of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, recently managed to successfully hindcast climate shifts in the Pacific. These shifts also have a profound effect on the average global surface air temperature of the Earth. The most recent shift in the 1990s is one of the reasons that the Earth’s temperature has not risen further since 1998. The study, published in the online edition of Journal of Climate, shows the potential for long-term climate predictions.
What happened in the years 1976/77 and 1998/99 in the Pacific was so unusual that scientists spoke of abrupt climate changes. They referred to a sudden warming of the tropical Pacific in the mid-1970s and rapid cooling in the late 1990s. Both events turned the world’s climate topsy-turvy and are clearly reflected in the average temperature of the Earth. Today we know that the cause is the interaction between ocean and atmosphere. Is it possible to successfully predict such climate shifts? This is the question that scientists, under the auspices of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, pursued. Using a coupled model of the ocean and the atmosphere, they were able to successfully replicate these events.
“The ocean plays a crucial role in our climate system, especially when it comes to fluctuations over several years or decades,” explains Prof. Mojib Latif, co-author of the study. “The chances of correctly predicting such variations are much better than the weather for the next few weeks, because the climate is far less chaotic than the rapidly changing weather conditions,” said Latif. This is due to the slow changes in ocean currents which affect climate parameters such as air temperature and precipitation. “The fluctuations of the currents bring order to the weather chaos”.
The researchers used a climate model, a so-called coupled ocean-atmosphere model, which they forced with the observed wind data of the last decades. For the abrupt changes during the 1970s and 1990s they calculated predictions which began a few months prior to the beginning of the observed climate shifts. The average of all predictions for both abrupt changes shows good agreement with the observed climate development in the Pacific. “The winds change the ocean currents which in turn affect the climate. In our study, we were able to identify and realistically reproduce the key processes for the two abrupt climate shifts,” says Prof. Latif. “We have taken a major step forward in terms of short-term climate forecasting, especially with regard to the development of global warming. However, we are still miles away from any reliable answers to the question whether the coming winter in Germany will be rather warm or cold”. Prof. Latif cautions against too much optimism regarding short-term regional climate predictions: “Since the reliability of those predictions is still at about 50%, you might as well flip a coin”.

"Fringe climate science deniers who spread online disinformation are now downplaying the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new analysis.  DeSmog, a blog and organization that tracks the culprits behind false information about the climate crisis, identified about 70 individuals and groups questioning the deadliness of the coronavirus and pushing for an end to social distancing, along with protesters who have been encouraged by Donald Trump. From the conservative conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to the US-based Heartland Institute and UK-based James Delingpole, the review concludes that the same influencers trying to make the public question the severity of global heating are also discounting the science surrounding Covid-19. “The climate war has largely been about confusing the public and making people trust in science and government less,” said DeSmog’s executive director, Brendan DeMelle. “And here we are in a pandemic where science and global cooperation are critical, and that’s a threat to the ideology of a lot of these … organizations. “You end up with this conspiracy theory about big government taking over our lives, taking away our freedoms, subjecting us to stay-at-home orders that we have to liberate ourselves from,” DeMelle said. DeSmog also identified fossil fuel and chemical industry aligned interests touting single-use plastics in personal protective gear, food packaging and grocery bags. John Cook, who studies climate denial at the center for climate change communication at George Mason University, said he expected the overlap but was surprised by the extent of the parallels. “People who are politically conservative and who value individual rights over collective responsibility are less supporting of social distancing policies and also just have a lower understanding of the dangers of Covid-19,” Cook said, citing emerging polling data. Cook outlines five techniques of science denial that people should watch for, including the cherry-picking of data. “The latest argument that we should relax social distancing because the curve [of cases] is flattening is very much an example of cherry-picking,” Cook said. In the US, some of the same groups that have petitioned the Trump administration to debate human-caused climate disruption and to roll back climate standards are sowing distrust of epidemiological research. Jay Lehr, the former science director of the Heartland Institute who now works for the Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition, on 30 March said people have been “barraged on the 24/7 news cycle for years” about climate change and now “face a more realistic fear of the most contagious virus any of us have ever experienced” but “both, however, suffer from questionable statistics and predictions that make us wonder what is real and what is someone’s best guess”. Heartland’s communications director, Jim Lakely, in a podcast about the “Wuhan virus” on 15 March compared the virus to a bad flu season and said that while “the panic is definitely more dangerous than the flu – this has to be put in perspective. “We have to think about the economic damage this is doing to the country. This is incalculable,” Lakely said. The Heartland Institute also posted a piece by economics professor Daniel Sutter arguing that alternative strategies to social distancing – like sheltering vulnerable populations – “could have mitigated the human toll at a significantly lower economic and social cost”. The Manhattan Institute, which calls itself a free-market thinktank, ran an article from Heather MacDonald in which she wrote: “Even if my odds of dying from coronavirus should suddenly jump ten-thousand-fold, from the current rate of 0.000012 percent across the U.S. population all the way up to 0.12 percent, I’d happily take those odds over the destruction being wrought on the U.S. and global economy from this unbridled panic.” The Media Research Center in a video said: “This is exactly how they incite mass panic: through lies and deception and exploiting ignorance. It’s how they convince people that we’re all going to die because Trump doesn’t believe in science or something.” Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who founded Infowars, has called the virus a “hoax” and appeared at a “You Can’t Close America” rally in Austin on Saturday, where he shook hands with unmasked supporters. Fossil fuel supporters have also capitalized on the pandemic to warn of the costs of climate action. Alex Epstein, the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress which DeSmog cites as associated with various groups connected to the rightwing billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, called the current recession a “mild preview of the Green New Deal”, and said that “our biggest ally in the fight against coronavirus is the fossil fuel industry.” The links between climate science denial and Covid-19 downplaying reach outside the US. In the UK, Delingpole, a rightwing commentator, has reposted calls to rapidly return to regular life. In a recent podcast, he called doubters of quarantining measures “lockdown skeptics”, and referred to those who support social distancing as “hysterical bedwetters”. He accused the media of promoting panic in “hysterical tabloids”."
"Some dogs have two different coloured eyes. Do other animals (besides people) and, if so, why? – George, aged ten, Hethersett, UK. Some dogs are born with one brown eye and one blue eye, which can look very strange, since we’re used to seeing dogs with two brown eyes. This is sometimes called “wall eye”, and it’s caused by certain genes that are passed down from parents to offspring.  If you look closely, you’ll also see that dogs with two different coloured eyes have unusually coloured coats, too. Their coats might be dappled or streaked with white. This is because the genes for eye colour and coat colour are closely connected.  The parents themselves may not show any sign of these unusual coat or eye colours. But usually there’s at least one dog on both sides of the family tree that has the unusual colouring. That’s how the mother and father can both pass on the genes that give some of their puppies the unusual colouring.  Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. All questions are welcome: serious, strange or funny – send them in, along with your name, age and town or city, to curiouskids@theconversation.com. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our very best. By now, you might be wondering – what are genes? Let me explain: every living thing is made up of cells. Each cell contains all the information needed to tell the body what to look like and how to work. Every little bit of information is called a “gene”, and there are lots and lots of genes which decide nearly every aspect of how we are.  For example, there are around 25,000 genes in human cells, which can decide everything from our height, to our hair colour or how likely we are to get certain diseases. The genes are made up of DNA, and held together on stringy structures called “chromosomes” in the centre of the cell.  Because every mammal comes from two parents, it has two copies of every gene – one from the mother and one from the father. Each copy may be telling the body to do something different. For example, the mother’s gene might be saying “dark hair” while the father’s says “fair hair”.  In that case, the mother’s gene will win and their baby will have dark hair, because the dark hair gene is dominant over the fair hair gene. The baby will only have fair hair if both parents pass on the gene for fair hair. The genes for wall eye and streaky coat are similar to the fair haired gene, in this way. An animal will only have those features if that specific gene is passed down from both parents. When the mother and father carry the gene, but don’t have wall eye themselves, then some of their offspring will have it, though not all of them.  Wall eye is also sometimes seen in rabbits, cats, cattle, sheep and horses. Horses that have one blue eye usually have black and white patches on their coat – they are called “piebald” or “pinto” or “paint”. Some of these horses even have two blue eyes (one of mine does!), which makes them look even more unusual. Humans can also have one blue eye and another of a different colour, like brown or green. This often goes with a white streak in the front of their hair.  Sometimes, having wall eye can cause problems. For dogs, the eye that is blue often has problems that can affect its sight. For this reason, breeders don’t let two dogs with wall eye and streaky coat have puppies together. If they do, then the puppies will often be blind and sometimes deaf as well.  In horses, wall eye does not seem to cause problems with vision, though having two blue eyes can be associated with deafness. Some cats and humans who have it can also have trouble hearing, and humans whose parents both have wall eye may be unable to speak or hear.

"**The testing of people without Covid symptoms is starting in Scotland in a bid to trace the virus more effectively.**
Residents in five coronavirus hotspots where cases are ""stubbornly high"" are being targeted as part of a trial.
Tests are now available for students planning to return home from university, and there are plans to expand testing within healthcare settings.
Testing of people without symptoms began on Thursday in **Alloa** , Clackmannanshire, after a mobile testing unit was set up in the car park of the town hall.
It will be operational until Wednesday following evidence of spread in the community and local care homes. The virus has also affected local schools.
In Glasgow, residents in **Dalmarnock** and parts of **Pollokshields** are also being encouraged to book a test if they do not have Covid symptoms.
Two sites will be operational on week days from Monday until 9 December between 09:00 and 18:00 and each will be able to test up to 800 people a day.
Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""If we could make sure that we tell people that they've got it, even when they have no symptoms then that would be another step in the fight against staying in level four.""
In East Ayrshire, people who live in **Stewarton** , **Dalmellington** and **Bellsbank** are being invited to take a test next week.
A mobile testing unit will be set up at the Rose Reilly Sports Centre in Stewarton from Monday until Friday 4 December.
It will then relocate to the Dalmellington Area Centre from Saturday until Monday 7 December.
The units, which will be operated by the Scottish Ambulance Service, aim to deliver results within 24 to 48 hours.
In South Ayrshire, tests will be available at the **Girvan** Quay Zone from Monday until Friday, from 10:00 to 16:00.
And from Saturday to 7 December appointments will also be available at the John Pollock Centre in **Ayr.**
The asymptomatic tests in all of the locations can be booked online by local residents.
Meanwhile, a drop-in testing service will be available at **Johnstone** town hall, Renfrewshire, from Wednesday for seven days.
Local residents will be offered lateral flow tests, which can be processed on site and give a result within an hour.
It will have the capacity to test up to 12,000 people a week.
Experts say mass testing could cut the chain of transmission by identifying asymptomatic cases of coronavirus, and could be expanded to more communities if it is successful.
Scotland's clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, has previously ruled out a city-wide mass testing programme like that in Liverpool, saying he wanted to target smaller areas where communication with the public would be easier.
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman announced a significant expansion of asymptomatic testing, using rapid turnaround lateral flow tests, last week.
Lateral flow devices have allowed the introduction of mass testing but they are not as accurate as the PCR tests which are carried out at NHS test centres and identify about seven in 10 positive cases of Covid.
Testing for Covid is being extended to everyone admitted to hospital emergency departments, acute assessment centres, maternity units and emergency mental health units.
By mid-December that will be extended to all medical and surgical elective admissions.
The Scottish government wants to extend routine testing to all healthcare workers.
Over the month of December, it will phase in twice-weekly testing for everyone working in ""patient-facing"" roles in hospitals as well as in the Scottish Ambulance Service, Covid Assessment Centres and NHS workers who visit care homes
There are up to 42,000 care home residents across Scotland and they are currently allowed one designated visitor.
The aim is to give the visitor a lateral flow test on the day of the visit so that if it is positive they can isolate and avoid harming the resident.
An initial rollout will begin with 12 care homes across four local authority areas from 7 December.
The full roll out across all homes will completed take until early February.
To facilitate Christmas visiting in all care homes, PCR testing will be provided for those that do not have access to lateral flow testing by that time.
From mid-January, care home workers will be included in the testing programme, including permanent and visiting staff.
It also includes staff who are personal assistants to a person's home and covers residential settings, sheltered housing and day care.
The Scottish government said the logistics of this were not straightforward and it would start in the local authority areas with the highest virus prevalence and hope to cover the whole sector by March.
Tens of thousands of students are being encouraged to get tested before they travel back to their family homes.
They are being offered two lateral flow tests, three days apart, from Monday. St Andrews University began its mass testing on Saturday.
The Scottish government said details would be set out shortly for the staggered return of university students in the new year and how testing would be put in place again.
All school staff can currently access testing if they are concerned they have been at risk from infection.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he was committed to exploring how he could extend testing for teachers further.
Pilot programmes will begin in the new year."
"It is never pleasant to see wild animals caged and abused. A new report by the NGO World Animal Protection suggests that captive-breeding operations for lions and tigers have expanded to meet an increasing demand for big cat products used in traditional Asian medicine. While this is clearly bad news for the captive cats themselves, confined in often horrible conditions, we are not convinced by the report’s findings on what this means for wild populations. Animal welfare organisations often suggest that farming wild species will lead to an increased loss of animals from their natural habitats. Either this is because animals are taken from the wild to stock the farms, or because the sale of farmed products increases demand for the wild version, leading to more illegal killing (also known as “poaching”).  For instance, the new report found anecdotal evidence that wild lionesses were sometimes killed in order to capture their cubs and smuggle them into captive facilities to diversify the gene pool and reduce inbreeding problems. World Animal Protection suggests that by “sustaining demand for [big cat] products” these farming operations are “exacerbating the decline” of big cats in the wild. However, we argue there is insufficient data to prove that overall poaching of lions or tigers has increased specifically because of these farming operations. Even if poaching has increased since farming operations have expanded, there’s not yet been a cause-effect mechanism found to prove that farming has contributed to an increase in poaching. To understand this conundrum, we would need to look at the counterfactual: with all other things being equal, what happens to overall poaching numbers when there is or is not farming? One study that looked at the impact of South Africa’s lion farms found that the trade had negligible effects on wild lion populations. Another report found that seizures of illegal tiger parts were increasing, but attributed it to expanding tiger farm operations (so more supply flowing in the illegal trade) rather than increased poaching of wild tigers. It is also not clear if an increase in enforcement effort could partly explain this increase in seizures reported. Again, to really understand a cause-effect relationship, we need more (and better) data. In some instances, farming of wild animals has helped to reduce poaching. Crocodiles for instance were once regularly hunted for their hide and meat. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation then provided assistance to set up crocodile farming operations, which took the pressure off wild populations. There is, however, one large difference between the crocodile trade and the big cat trade: many consumers of big cat parts say they prefer wild-caught individuals, whereas purchasers of crocodile leather products prefer farmed, as you generally get better quality hides. But people who say that they prefer wild animal products may not always then go on to buy them in real life, especially if it’s easier, cheaper or more legal to buy from farms. To suggest that farming big cats increases poaching potentially is misleading without providing firm evidence that poaching of wild animals will decline without the farms. Though some may argue for the precautionary principle (that is, ban everything then work out what the best approach is), until we know more, closing these farming operations may have the unintended consequence of actually increasing the poaching of wild animals. In examples like the lion and tiger trade where farming already exists, we must first understand and tackle demand for these products before bans are put in place, to ensure we do not accidentally increase pressure on wild animals. It is tempting to act swiftly due to the widespread and alarming decline of biodiversity. However, we caution against rushed actions that, while well meaning, may not be based on firm evidence and could end up creating worse problems. What we really need first is better data on how captive-bred farming affects wild animal populations. The conditions for individual animals on many of these farms may be abhorrent, but if the main goal is to conserve wild species, we must act on science rather than emotion."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Spiegel here has a new clip on the ongoing rescue attempts of the “Akademik Shokalskiy” research vessel. Both a French and Chinese icebreaker have given up trying to reach the trapped 74 persons on board the vessel.
Spiegel writes “The polar ice is too thick.”
Currently Antarctic sea ice is defying all the claims of global warming and is way over 1 million square kilometers above average. (Lots of sea ice charts here)

Sea ice around Antarctica ignores global warming claims. Chart: NSIDC
“No guarantee it will get through the thick ice”
Meanwhile Swiss news site TribunedeGeneve reports that an Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis is on its way and is expected to arrive Sunday evening.
Tribune de Genève adds: “The Australian icebreaker that will attempt the rescue comes with no guarantee it will get through the thick ice” and that it “can break through ice that is 1.6 meters thick but the Akademik Shokalskiy is imprisoned in ice that is 3 meters thick.”

Rescue by helicopter
Should the ice breaker fail to reach the vessel, then they “will try to use the helicopter that is on board the Chinese icebreaker Snow Dragon.”
Ironically the purpose of the expedition was to replicate the route of Antarctic scientist Douglas Mawson of 100 years earlier and to record the changes occurring in the Antarctica due to global warming.
Normally ships are able travel there
Mawson’s base set up 100 years ago is located in a zone were able to travel at this time of the year, Tribune Genève writes.
While Mawson’s crude ship managed to navigate to the continent, Turney’s modern ship has become trapped inside dense sea ice and now threatens to be crushed.
Big cracks are appearing
But there is hope. Australian ABC news reports that “the pack ice seems to be opening up a little bit” and that there “are big cracks appearing way towards the horizon“.

"**Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world with more than 60 million confirmed cases in 190 countries and about 1.5 million deaths.**
The virus is surging in many regions and countries that had apparent success in suppressing initial outbreaks are also seeing infections rise again.
In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 5,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.
_Note: The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands._
Coronavirus cases have surged over the past few months in several regions of the world and large numbers of new infections are being reported daily.
The most recent figures show more than 500,000 new cases reported in 24 hours.
World Health Organization Director General Tedrosâ¯ Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said positive news from vaccine trials means the ""light at the end of this long, dark tunnel is growing brighter"".
But he warned against allowing the poorest and most vulnerable to be ""trampled in the stampede"" to get inoculated.
As populations await vaccine roll-out, cases remain high across a number of regions of the world.
The US has recorded more than 13.5 million cases and nearly 270,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world.
Daily cases have been at record levels since early November and there are now more than 90,000 people in hospital, more than in either of the two previous peaks of the pandemic.
One US disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said the country could face another surge of cases as Americans return home after the Thanksgiving holiday.
The outbreak has had a devastating impact on the US economy, although there are now some signs it is recovering.
Nearly eight million Americans, many of them children and minorities, have fallen into poverty since May, according to researchers.
Daily cases have risen in many European countries since July.
France has recorded more than two million cases; Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK have all recorded more than one million cases. but all their numbers have either stabilised or started to fall in recent days.
Lockdowns and other restrictions were reintroduced in some of the worst-affected regions to help bring numbers down.
Japan is on ""maximum alert"" after seeing a record number of daily cases in a third wave of infections. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged people to do all they could to prevent new infections.
The number of new deaths in Japan, however, has remained relatively low. Other countries that have seen a resurgence of the virus include Turkey, Canada and Russia.
Several countries around the world are currently seeing cases spike.
In the Middle East, both Iran and Jordan have seen the number of daily infections rise sharply in recent weeks. Numbers have also been rising Ukraine.
In Latin America, Brazil has more than six million confirmed cases and the world's second highest death toll. There are concerns the country is now facing a second wave of infections.
Argentina, Colombia and Mexico have also recorded more than one million cases. Peru is also approaching that milestone, although daily cases are falling.
India has driven the increase in numbers in Asia, with over nine million confirmed infections, the second-highest official total in the world after the US.
Africa has recorded more than two million cases, although the true extent of the pandemic there is not known as testing rates are low.
South Africa, with about 800,000 cases and more than 21,000 deaths, is still the worst affected country on the continent. Morocco, Egypt and Ethiopia are the only other African countries to officially record more than 100,000 cases.
The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
The outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020 and declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March.
A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.
Governments across the world have been forced to limit public movement and close businesses and venues in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. This has had a devastating impact on the global economy.
Damage to the world's major economies is four times worse than the 2009 global financial crisis, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Meanwhile, the United Nations has said that up to 265 million people could face starvation by the end of the year because of the impact of Covid-19.
The pandemic could also wipe out 25 years of increasing gender equality, data from UN Women suggests.
The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations.
When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.
Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic."

The full text of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement was released last Thursday. At over 6,000 pages (by most estimates — I haven’t counted them myself!), it’s quite a challenge to digest. It’s easy to pick out obscure technical issues and discuss them with trade experts; it’s harder to talk about the big picture significance for a mass audience.   
  
  
Economist Jeffrey Sachs tried to do this in an op‐​ed in the _Boston Globe_ , and I think he offered a good starting point:   




The agreement, with its 30 chapters, is really four complex deals in one. The first is a free‐​trade deal among the signatories. That part could be signed today. Tariff rates would come down to zero; quotas would drop; trade would expand; and protectionism would be held at bay.   
  
  
The second is a set of regulatory standards for trade. Most of these are useful, requiring that regulations that limit trade should be based on evidence, not on political whims or hidden protectionism.   
  
  
The third is a set of regulations governing investor rights, intellectual property, and regulations in key service sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, e‐​commerce, and pharmaceuticals. These chapters are a mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly. Their common denominator is that they enshrine the power of corporate capital above all other parts of society, including labor and even governments.   
  
  
The fourth is a set of standards on labor and environment that purport to advance the cause of social fairness and environmental sustainability. But the agreements are thin, unenforceable, and generally unimaginative. For example, climate change is not even mentioned, much less addressed boldly and creatively.



I would say he gets this about half right. Some clarifications are in order.   
  
  
He’s right about the free trade part. We should do the tariff/​quota reduction part today (or better yet, years ago!).   
  
  
He’s also right about his third category of regulations, on investor rights, intellectual property, and services. As with most regulations, some are good, some are useless, and some are downright harmful. The TPP regulations are no different.   
  
  
As for the second category, however, when you talk about international rules that require evidence‐​based regulation, or prohibit hidden protectionism, that’s already taken care of at the WTO. The WTO has a great track record of handling these cases. It’s not clear how the TPP would add much here.   
  
  
Finally, he wants stronger labor and environmental rules in the TPP, but it’s not clear to me why those subjects are suited for trade agreements. Whatever you think about climate change, for example, if you are going to address that in a treaty, it seems appropriate to do so in a climate change treaty, not a trade treaty. Regardless, these regulations are really just part of the general category of regulations, along with investor rights, intellectual property, and services.   
  
  
Summing this up, and narrowing his four categories to two, the TPP has two major aspects to think about: the trade liberalizing part, which is good; and the regulatory part, which is pretty mixed. The best way to evaluate the TPP over the next year — which many people are saying is how long we have until a Congressional vote — is to figure out how much liberalization is in there, and just how good/​bad/​ugly the regulatory aspects are, and weigh and balance the two.

Last week I was on John Stossel’s (most excellent) new show on Fox Business News to discuss energy policy -- in particular, popular myths that Republicans have about energy markets. One of the topics I touched upon was nuclear power. My argument was the same that I have offered in print: Nuclear power is a swell technology but, given the high construction costs associated with building nuclear reactors, it’s a technology that cannot compete in free markets without a massive amount of government support. If one believes in free markets, then one should look askance at such policies.   
  
As expected, the atomic cult has taken offense.   
  
Now, it is reasonable to argue that excessive regulatory oversight has driven up the cost of nuclear power and that a “better” regulatory regime would reduce costs. Perhaps. But I have yet to see any concrete accounting of exactly which regulations are “bad” along with associated price tags for the same. If anyone out there in Internet-land has access to a good, credible accounting like that, please, send it my way. But until I see something tangible, what we have here is assertion masquerading as fact.   
  
Most of those who consider themselves “pro-nuke” are unaware of the fact that the current federal regulatory regime was thoroughly reformed in the late 1990s to comport with the industry’s model of what a “good” federal regulatory regime would look like. As Oliver Kingsley Jr., the President of Exelon Nuclear, put it in Senate testimony back in 2001: 



The current regulatory environment has become more stable, timely, and predictable, and is an important contributor to improved performance of nuclear plants in the United States. This means that operators can focus more on achieving operational efficiencies and regulators can focus more on issues of safety significance. It is important to note that safety is being maintained and, in fact enhanced, as these benefits of regulatory reform are being realized. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- and this Subcommittee -- can claim a number of successes in their efforts to improve the nuclear regulatory environment. These include successful implementation of the NRC Reactor Oversight Process, the timely extension of operating licenses at Calvert Cliffs and Oconee, the establishment of a one-step licensing process for advanced reactors, the streamlining of the license transfer process, and the increased efficiency in processing licensing actions.



It’s certainly possible that the industry left some desirable reforms undone, but it seems relevant to me that the Nuclear Energy Institute -- the trade association for the nuclear energy industry and a fervent supporter of all these government assistance programs -- does not complain that they’re being unfairly hammered by costly red-tape.   
  
For the most part, however, the push-back against the arguments I offered last week has little to do with this. It has to do with bias. According to a post by Rod Adams over at “Atomic Insights Blog,” I am guilty of ignoring subsidies doled-out to nuclear’s biggest competitor -- natural gas -- and because Cato gets money from Koch Industries, it’s clear that my convenient neglect of that matter is part of a corporate-funded attack on nuclear power. Indeed, Mr. Adams claims that he has unearthed a “smoking gun” with this observation.   
  
Normally, I would ignore attacks like this. This particular post, however, offers the proverbial “teachable moment” that should not be allowed to go to waste.   




First, let’s look at the substance of the argument. Did I “give natural gas a pass” as Mr. Adams contends? Well, yes and no; the show was about the cost of nuclear power, not the cost of natural gas. I did note that natural gas-fired electricity was more attractive in this economic environment than nuclear power, something that happens to be true. Had John Stossel asked me about whether gas’ economic advantage was due to subsidy, I would have told him that I am against natural gas subsidies as well -- a position I have staked-out time and time again in other venues (while there are plenty of examples, this piece I co-authored with Daniel Becker -- then of the Sierra Club -- for _The Los Angeles Times_ represents my thinking on energy subsidies across the board. A blog post a while back about the Democratic assault on oil and gas subsidies found me arguing that the D’s should actually go further! Dozens of other similar arguments against fossil fuel subsidies can be found on my publications page). So let’s dispose of Mr. Adams’ implicit suggestion that I am some sort of tool for the oil and gas industry, arguing against subsidies _here_ but not against subsidies _there_.   
  
Second, let’s consider the implicit assertion that Mr. Adams makes -- that natural gas-fired electricity is more attractive than nuclear power primarily because of subsidy. The most recent and thorough assessment of this matter comes from Prof. Gilbert Metcalf, an economist at Tufts University. Prof. Metcalf agrees with a 2004 report from the Energy Information Administration which contended that preferences for natural gas production in the tax code do little to increase natural gas production and thus do little to make natural gas less expensive than it might otherwise be. They are wealth transfers for sure, but they do not do much to change natural gas supply or demand curves and thus do not affect consumer prices. Prof. Metcalf argues that if we had truly level regulatory playing field without any tax distortions, natural gas-fired electricity would actually go down, not up! Government intervention in energy markets does indeed distort gas-fired electricity prices. It makes those prices _higher_ than they otherwise would be!   
  
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) identified five natural gas subsidies in 2007 that were relevant to the electricity sector (table 5). Only two are of particular consequence. They are: 





Even if we put aside the fact that these subsidies don’t impact final consumer prices in any significant manner, it’s useful to keep in mind the fact that the subsidy per unit of gas-fired electricity production -- as calculated by EIA -- works out to 25 cents per megawatt hour (table 35). Subsidy per unit of nuclear-fired electricity production works out to $1.59 per megawatt hour. Hence, the argument that nuclear subsidies are relatively small in comparison with natural gas subsidies is simply incorrect.   
  
Some would argue that the Foreign Tax Credit -- a generally applicable credit available to corporations doing business overseas that allows firms to treat royalty payments to foreign governments as a tax that can be deducted from domestic corporate income taxes -- should likewise be on the subsidy list. The Environmental Law Institute calculates that this credit saves the fossil fuel industry an additional $15.3 billion. There is room for debate about the wisdom of that credit, but regardless, it doesn’t appear as if the Foreign Tax Credit affects domestic U.S. prices for gas-fired electricity.   
  
The bigger point is that without government help, few doubt that the natural gas industry would still be humming and electricity would still be produced in large quantities from gas-fired generators. But without government production subsidies, without loan guarantees, and without liability protection via the Price-Anderson Act, even the nuclear power industry concedes that they would disappear.   
  
Now, to be fair, Prof. Metcalf reports that nuclear power is cheaper than gas-fired power under both current law and under a no-subsidy, no-tax regime. His calculations, however, were made at a time when natural gas prices were at near historic highs that were thought to be the new norm in energy markets and were governed by fairly optimistic assumptions about nuclear power plant construction costs. Those assumptions have not held-up well with time. For a more recent assessment, see my review of this issue in _Reason_along with this study from MIT, which warns that if more government help isn’t forthcoming, “nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation.”   
  
Third, Mr. Adams argues that federal nuclear loan guarantee program is a self-evidently good deal and implies that only an anti-industry agitprop specialist (like me) could possibly refuse to see that. “That program, with its carefully designed and implemented due diligence requirements for project viability, should actually produce revenue for the government.” Funny, but when private investors perform those due diligence exercises, they come to a very different conclusion … which is why we have a federal loan guarantee program in the first place.   
  
Who do you trust to watch over your money -- investment bankers or Uncle Sam? The former don’t have the best track record in the world these days, but note that the popular indictment of that crowd is that investment banks weren’t tight fisted _enough_ when it came to lending. If even these guys were saying no to nuclear power -- and at a time when money was flowing free and easy -- what makes Mr. Adams think that a bunch of politicians are right about the glorious promise of nuclear power, particularly given the “too cheap to meter” rhetoric we’ve heard from the political world now for the better part of five decades?   
  
Anyway, for what it’s worth, the Congressional Budget Office has taken a close look at this alleged bonanza for the taxpayer and judged the risk of default on these loan guarantees to be around 50 percent. They may be wrong of course, but the risks are there, something Moody’s acknowledged last year in a published analysis warning that they were likely to downgrade the credit-worthiness of nuclear power plant construction loans.   
  
Fourth and finally, Mr. Adams cites Cato’s skepticism about “end-is-near” climate alarmism as yet more evidence that we are on the take from the fossil fuels industry. I don’t know if Mr. Adams has been following current events lately, but I would think that we’re looking pretty good right now on that front. _Der Spiegel_ \-- no hot-bed of “Big Oil” agitprop -- sums up the state of the debate rather nicely in the wake of the ongoing collapse of IPCC credibility. Matt Ridley -- another former devotee of climate alarmism -- likewise sifts through the rubble that is now the infamous Michael Mann “hockey stick” analysis (which allegedly demonstrated an unprecedented degree of warming in the 20th Century) and finds thorough and total rot at the heart of the alarmist argument. Mr. Adams is perhaps unaware that our own Pat Michaels has been making these arguments for years and Cato has no apologies to make on that score.   
  
Regardless, ad hominem is the sign of a man running out of arguments. There aren’t many here to rebut, but the form of the complaints offered by Mr. Adams speaks volumes about how little the pro-nuclear camp has to offer right now in defense of nuclear power subsidies.   
  
I have no animus towards nuclear power per se. If nuclear power could compete without government help, I would be as happy as Mr. Adams or the next MIT nuclear engineer. But I am no more “pro” nuclear power than I am “pro” any power. It is not for me to pick winners in the market place. That’s the invisible hand’s job. If there is bad regulation out there harming the industry, then by all means, let’s see a list of said bad regulations and amend them accordingly. But once those regulations are amended (if there are indeed any that need amending), nuclear power should still be subject to an unbiased market test. Unlike Mr. Adams, I don’t want to see that test rigged.

"Forest elephant extinction would exacerbate climate change. That’s according to a new study in Nature Geoscience which links feeding by elephants with an increase in the amount of carbon that forests are able to store. The bad news is that African forest elephants – smaller and more vulnerable relatives of the better known African bush elephant – are fast going extinct. If we allow their ongoing extermination to continue, we will be also worsening climate change. The good news is that if we protect and conserve these elephants, we will simultaneously fight climate change. Elephants are fascinating animals, and I have studied them for more than 15 years. They are intelligent, sentient, and highly social. But their single most remarkable feature is their size. Evolutionarily, elephants gambled on becoming massive enough to deter predators like lions and tigers.  In exchange, they became slaves to their appetite. Elephants need huge amounts of food everyday, something like 5-10% of their body mass. A typical three-tonne female could eat 200 kg of plant material in one day. Her family may need to consume more than a tonne of food per day.  It is not easy to find so much food, especially in tropical rain forests, where plants have high concentrations of chemical defences (toxins) to avoid being eaten. Elephants spend most of their life eating and looking for food. We can think of them as “eating machines”. African forest elephants are particularly fond of saplings, young trees, and the plants that first grow into newly opened gaps in the forest. These “early succession” plants are specialised in growing fast following a disturbance and they invest less in chemical defences. Early succession trees also have lower wood density than slow-growing late-succession tree species. Elephant eating manners are also remarkable. They feed by breaking stems and branches, pulling down lianas, uprooting whole plants, stripping leaves off twigs, and so on. It is easy to notice their presence because of the mess they leave behind.  The key novelty of the new study, by the ecologist Fabio Berzaghi and colleagues, is they include, for the first time, the effect of elephant feeding disturbances in a computer model that simulates  demographic processes in forest ecosystems. They found that “elephant disturbance” – all that messy eating – results in forests having fewer, larger trees. Elephants filter out small early-succession (i.e. low wood density) trees, promoting the dominance of late-succession (high wood density) trees, which ultimately leads to long-term increases in the total biomass. Berzaghi and colleagues were able to validate their model predictions with data from real forest plots in the Congo Basin. By promoting these larger, woodier trees, elephant feeding disturbances therefore mean the forest stores more carbon. These results have important and far reaching implications for elephant conservation and carbon policy. The authors estimate that the disappearance of African forest elephants would result in a loss of as much as 7% of the carbon stocks in Central African forests, which they valued at around US$43 billion, based on a conservative carbon stock price. In short, forest elephants are our allies in the fight against climate change and their existence saves us tens of billions of dollars in climate responses. The situation of African forest elephants is particularly dramatic. Once numbered in the millions, their population is now less than 10% of its potential size and, in the decade from 2002 to 2011, as many as 62% of forest elephants might have been killed. This decline is mostly due to poaching to feed Asian demand for ivory as well as increasing human encroaching of their habitats. What a sad reason for a massacre and an ecological disaster.  Scientists largely recognise African bush (Loxodonta africana) and forest (L. cyclotis) elephants as different species. However because of practical challenges (such as dealing with abundant hybrid populations), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which officially tracks endangered species, has kept the two together. The problem is that the more populous bush elephants have masked a drastic reduction in their forest cousins.  Berzaghi and colleagues emphasise the need for forest elephants to be finally acknowledged as their own species. This would give them a separate IUCN Red List status – probably marked as “endangered” – and trigger important policies and actions. Berzaghi and colleagues show that forest elephants produce ecosystem services in the form of climate stability from which we all benefit, including people like you and me who might never visit the forests of Central Africa. If we are all beneficiaries of elephant conservation, we should be also responsible for it. It is very important that more affluent societies assume a bigger share of the responsibility to conserve the elephants and other tropical biodiversity from which we benefit. In the past decade we have learned a lot about how important elephants and other large animals are for functioning ecosystems. It is time to apply this knowledge. Berzaghi and colleagues produced evidence linking the behaviour of a single species – feeding disturbances by African forest elephants – to global-scale climatic impacts. As mentioned earlier, the bad news is that we humans are killing elephants and ruining our planet. The good news is that we could synergise efforts and fight climate change by effectively protecting and restoring forest elephant populations and their habitats. The choice seems obvious to me."
"**The UK economy will be among the hardest hit by the pandemic, a leading international agency has suggested.**
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that by the end of 2021 it will be more than 6% smaller than before the Covid health crisis.
Among the world's major economies only Argentina is predicted to do worse.
By contrast, the OECD predicts the global economy overall will be back to pre-pandemic levels by then.
There is some cautious optimism for next year and beyond in this report, but that is struggling against the immediate fact that there have been new virus outbreaks and containment measures.
That is likely to lead to further declines in economic activity in the short term in some countries, especially in Europe.
Nonetheless, the report says that for the first time since the pandemic began there is now hope for a brighter future.
Recent vaccine developments are the reason.
""Progress with vaccines and treatment have lifted expectations and uncertainty has receded.""
But the uncertainty hasn't gone away, and even if the vaccine hopes are fulfilled, there will be further economic strains, the report says, during the wait for them to be widely distributed.
For Britain, the OECD predicts the economy will shrink in 2020 by 11.2%, followed by growth of 4.2% and 4.1% in the next two years.
Unemployment will rise to an average of 7.4% in 2021, though as it is an average the peak would likely be somewhat higher. Before the crisis, the figure was below 4% so that's a large increase, though many other countries are likely to see higher levels.
The report says it's important for the UK to conclude a trade deal with the European Union by the end of the year. Failure to do so would, it says, ""entail serious additional economic disturbances in the short term and have a strongly negative effect on trade, productivity and jobs in the longer term"".
The OECD says the government and the Bank of England should maintain policies to support the economy until a recovery is well underway.
For the world economy, the recovery predicted next year is uneven. A third of the global growth is down to China, which by the end of next year is forecast to be almost 10% ahead of where it was at the end of 2019.
The rich countries will rebound in 2021 but it will be only a partial recovery from this year's recession.
Among the major developed economies, only the US is forecast to be ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the final quarter of next year and even that is by a small margin.
Most, including the UK will be significantly behind. So too will several important developing economies in addition to Argentina, including India and South Africa."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCFACT has a video of a speech made by physicist/astronaut Walter Cunningham while at COP 19 in Warsaw.

He starts by saying that climate used to be a very respected science, but that it began to deteriorate about 20 years ago and has long become politicized and is being misused for more government control. He believes that it has morphed into something that no longer resembles science and that skeptics are now being asked to disprove hypotheses.
Just after the 6-minute mark, Cunningham calls the hockey stick chart “phony” and that he hesitates calling those behind man-made global warming “scientists” because they have abandoned the principles of science.
He reminds the audience that new hypotheses must be supported by data, and that the global warming hypothesis fails the test.
At the 12-minute mark he comes right out and says “Their climate models have never successfully predicted anything” and that they are “based on assumptions, which are opinions.”
“Models are not data.”
At the 13:25 mark he adds, after searching for 15 years:

I have not found one piece of empirical evidence that man-made CO2 has a significant impact on global climate.”
Cunningham thinks that skeptics are winning the debate on the scientific front, but that the alarmists have the clear upper hand on the media front. “AGW is a matter of faith.”
He pleads with the audience to look at the data themselves and to make up their own minds. He says, “The IPCC is not a good place to look for objective data.”
He finishes with 4 conclusions:
1. There’s no reason to be concerned about today’s temperature or temperature trend.
2. Human produced CO2 is a miniscule factor in global temperature levels.
3. There’s no justification for believing CO2 and temperature are the ideal ones.
4. Humans cannot have any significant influence on the Earth’s temperature. Believing they can is a fantasy.

"The Church of England’s investment arm has urged shareholders in ExxonMobil to vote against re-electing the oil company’s entire board for failing to take action on the climate crisis. The Church Commissioners and New York State Common Retirement Fund have written to fellow ExxonMobil investors ahead of an annual shareholder meeting on 27 May, hoping to support for the protest votes, which include forcing ExxonMobil to disclose its lobbying activities and their cost . “Our voting intentions are, again, a measure of our profound dissatisfaction with ExxonMobil’s approach to climate change risks and the governance failures that underpin it,” the letter said. “As the world, ExxonMobil’s peers and investors confront the climate emergency, ExxonMobil is carrying on as if nothing has changed. It is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil’s inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a specific failure of independent directors to oversee management,” the letter added. A report released last year found that ExxonMobil would need to slash its oil production by 55% by 2040 to meet global climate targets and avoid driving temperatures 1.5C higher than pre-industrialised levels. The C of E holds a small stake in Exxon, worth about £7m compared with the oil company’s market value of more than $183bn (£146bn). However, the Church Commissioners have proven to be influential shareholders regardless of their size. Last year, ExxonMobil appealed to US regulators and successfully blocked a C of E-led resolution that would have forced the oil firm to disclose its emissions reduction targets. In protest, the C of E called for ExxonMobil to install an independent chairman, and it gained 40% backing. The Church Commissioners have again filed a resolution calling for the chief executive and chairman roles – held by Darren Woods – to be separated. But Exxon is again at odds with the Church Commissioners voting plans. The oil giant is recommending that investors vote in favour of re-electing all of its board members, but is recommending they reject the shareholder resolutions, including the lobbying report. A Guardian investigation last year found that Exxon had spent €37.2m (£32.4m) lobbying the EU since 2010, according to data released though the EU’s transparency register. That is more than other major oil companies including shell and BP, which spent €36.5m and €18.1m respectively on lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy. It also recently emerged that ExxonMobil met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to a climate lobbying watchdog. ExxonMobil was not immediately available for comment, but in a document released ahead of its AGM it said that its position on key issues and lobbying were publicly available on its website and that it followed all applicable disclosure laws. The company also defended the board’s approach to the climate crisis, saying it “routinely reviews environmental stewardship and discusses issues related to the company’s business, including the risks related to climate change”. ExxonMobil has rejected calls for an independent chairman, saying that the rest of the board was already made up of independent directors and that the change would not improve oversight or be in shareholders’ best interest."
"Since the end of World War II, 97% of the UK’s wildflower meadows have been dug up or destroyed. Many won’t remember a time when the countryside was filled with grassland that rippled with rainbows of flowers, but they are likely to recognise the intense yellow glare of pesticide-soaked oilseed rape fields that dominate rural landscapes today.  The joy of being immersed in a meadow – surrounded by the fluttering of butterflies, the chirping of crickets and the buzz of bees – is increasingly rare. Without urgent action to tackle dwindling biodiversity, these memories will disappear. Just like the flowers that they feed on, insect pollinators are in trouble, with one third of the UK’s wild bee and hoverfly species showing declines in their numbers since the 1980s. Clearing grassland for farms and using harmful chemicals such as pesticides on crops has driven many pollinator species to this state, but these insects are essential for growing many of our favourite crops.  By transferring pollen between flowers, they ensure that crop plants are successfully fertilised and can go on to develop the fruits and seeds that we like to eat. Without them, future generations may no longer be able to enjoy summer strawberries or autumn’s apples and pears.  How we grow food will need to change to ensure wildlife has room to live and isn’t exposed to toxic chemicals. In the meantime, there are solutions sitting right on our doorsteps. Simple changes to how our gardens, parks and public spaces are managed could give pollinators a brighter future. One way to protect our pollinators is to change the way that our roadsides are managed. Some country lanes are bursting with blooms, but the majority of road verges in the UK are cut to within an inch of their lives. Regular mowing is needed to ensure drivers can see clearly on sharp bends and junctions, but neat and tidy roadsides leave nothing for pollinators to eat.

      Four steps to make your lawn a wildlife haven – from green desert to miniature rainforest


 Sowing wildflower seed mixes and reducing how often verges are mowed can transform barren stretches of motorway into colourful meadows filled with the pollen and nectar that bees and butterflies currently struggle to find. Bees don’t seem to be put off by the traffic noise and their numbers have been shown to increase dramatically on verges that are cut no more than twice a year. Plantlife, a British conservation charity, has called on councils to turn their road verges into wildflower meadows by cutting just once in late summer, between mid-July and September. Pictorial Meadows is another campaign group that has researched how meadows can be encouraged in urban environments. It recommends cutting late to give flowers time to be pollinated, produce fruit and then set their seeds in the soil, so that the meadow can grow back year after year. Cutting earlier prevents flowers from fruiting and setting seed. Over 65,000 people have now signed a petition encouraging councils across the UK to allow wildflower meadows to grow on roadside verges. Councils seem to be listening. Rotherham Borough Council has established eight miles of meadows alongside a motorway, saving £23,000 per year on mowing costs. The UK road network spans over 246,000 miles – and reducing mowing on the grass verges that surround them to just once a year could save money and create thriving habitats for pollinating insects that return on their own each spring. Next time you are out in your local area, have a look at the roadsides and public spaces from the perspective of a hungry bee. Can you find any flowers? Is there enough variety for you to maintain a balanced diet? Will there still be flowers for you to feed on next week? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then you might be inspired to take action. If you have a garden, consider creating miniature meadows in underused patches of lawn, or focus on filling the flower beds with bee-friendly flowers. Small changes do add up. By signing the petition and engaging with your local council in the campaign, we could see rapid and widespread transformation of road networks and a blossoming future for butterflies and bees."
"**Advances in cancer research could be delayed by nearly 18 months due to the coronavirus pandemic, scientists fear.**
A survey of more than 200 scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research suggested research could be delayed by six months, due to factors including the first lockdown and capacity limits.
Other issues like charity funding, and research being shifted to Covid-19, mean major advances delayed by an average of 17 months, they said.
Researchers called for more funding.
They said that any long-lasting damage to cancer advances could be avoided if there is more government support or charity donations.
There have also been concerns about the effect the pandemic could have had on cancer more widely. The NHS's former cancer director Prof Sir Mike Richards has said England could see its first decrease in survival rates for decades. In England, 60% fewer patients with suspected cancer were seen in April, compared to the previous year.
The ICR surveyed 239 of its researchers to gauge the impact of its research.
Those who took part in the survey said they had lost an average of 10 weeks of research time due to the first lockdown - this was mostly due to not being able to access laboratories.
Researchers who took part in the survey on average spent 53% of their working time in a laboratory before lockdown - this decreased to 5% during lockdown, and is now at 34%.
Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said: ""Our researchers are passionate about making advances to benefit patients, so it has been hugely frustrating that their work has been so disrupted, although also inspiring to see how well they have adapted to the restrictions the pandemic has imposed on our lives.""
He said the results were ""sobering"" but added: ""Our survey though does provide solutions to mitigate the impact - in the form of investment in staffing, new technologies and computing power.""
ICR labs have stayed open during England's second lockdown, with measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The institute's deputy director of clinical trials and statistics, Prof Emma Hall, said ""non-Covid clinical research pretty much shut down within the NHS"" during the first lockdown, which started in March.
She said: ""Our work relies on new clinical trials starting up and existing ones continuing to happen - and Covid-19 has made that incredibly challenging. The pandemic has meant that it will take longer to answer the questions asked in our trials, and that will delay new treatments getting to patients.""
But she said the pandemic also brought about some positive changes.
Prof Hall added: ""We can capture and manage data remotely rather than relying on paper. The Covid-19 trials have also shown how research can benefit from easier access to routine medical data - hopefully this will be translated to other clinical research and mean more streamlined, simpler to run trials.
""I hope we can use this experience to benefit cancer patients in the long term, but that will only be possible with more support or future advances will be delayed."""

Sure, global warming policy seems off of the political radar, but it is still in the air, homing fast and true on your pocketbook via the stealth technology of the courts and the EPA. It will never be shot down.



Many would like to believe that cap‐​and‐​trade, carbon dioxide taxes, or simple command‐​and‐​control regulation went into a coma when the Senate failed to pass any companion legislation to the House’s American Clean Energy and Security (ACES) Act, which squeaked through 219–215 on June 26, 2009. And then, the myth goes, it died in the House blowout last November.



The reasoning in support of this is pretty straightforward. Almost every close House race in 2010 was won by a Republican. In the Senate, the dogfights all went Democrat. The difference between the two? The House passed ACES while the Senate twiddled down the clock.



This would all be correct if we were true to our Constitution, which established a federal government of profoundly limited power, granted great authority to the states, and, perhaps most important, limited the executive branch to mainly to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” (Article II). But, as my Cato Institute colleague Roger Pilon so eloquently points out, we live in a modern “Executive State” where a massive amount of power has been delegated from Congress to myriad agencies (such as EPA) where unelected, lifelong careerists, with the approval and support of the Executive Branch regulate our lives where legislators fear to tread, or, more accurately, are too chicken‐​bleep to tread.



And, thanks to the judicial tradition of deference to the expertise of these agencies, the courts have actually encouraged the growth of this constitutional miscarriage.



And so it goes with global warming. When ACES was under consideration, two inconvenient truths became apparent: it was the most draconian, intrusive piece of non‐​wartime legislation ever passed, and, even if dozens of nations that had commitments under the U.N.‘s Kyoto Protocol on global warming adopted and fulfilled it, the amount of global warming that would be prevented would be, within any reasonable time horizon, too small to even measure.



Draconian? How about, a mere 38 years from today, ACES would grant the average american the per capita carbon dioxide emissions of 1867? Futile? How about reducing global warming by about 0.07°C per 50 years, even with the participation of all those Kyoto nations?



And so, as carbon dioxide regulation died in the Senate, it was reborn via the Supreme Court and the EPA.



In its 2007 decision, _Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency_ the Court reversed its policy of deference to agencies and instead inserted itself smack in the middle of the political debate on global warming. The majority (5–4) opinion, authored by Justice Stevens, did so in its first words: “A well‐​documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related.” 



From that statement, which is devoid of any policy implications, the Court went on to command the EPA to move forward. The court could have also stated that there are plenty of “respected scientists” who believe that the future warming trend, while likely, has been grossly overestimated in magnitude and impact.



Specifically it directed the EPA to determine whether or not carbon dioxide was a “pollutant,” endangering human health and welfare, and, if it found that to be the case, then it must regulate it under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Forget that the authors of that law, such as Michigan’s John Dingell, have stated that the Act was never intended to regulate greenhouse gases.



And so, not surprisingly, on Dec. 7, 2009, the EPA found indeed that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, endangering our health and welfare, and soon after began to propose regulations, beginning with fuel economy standards, but certainly not ending until it is no longer “endangering.” They based this largely on two reports on climate change, one from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the other by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. Both claim to be authoritative and comprehensive.



Ah, but can’t Congress simply tell the EPA that it cannot regulate greenhouse gases? Sure, but the Senate fell 10 votes short on this last week. And even if it did pass, the president would surely veto it. It will be a hot day at the South Pole when there are 67 votes to override.



Of course, we could change presidents, right? In that eventuality, the EPA will have to somehow undermine the authority of our own Climate Change Science Program in order to reverse its endangerment finding.



Fat chance of that not winding up in court — the same courts that got us into this mess in the first place. Regulations will stand until scientists stand up, which will be never, as long as there is such funding gold in them thar hills of global warming.



Do not kid yourself. Draconian regulation of energy — which touches almost every aspect of our daily lives — is not dead. It is, in fact, immortal.

"**Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said a Wrexham laboratory could provide ""salvation for humanity"" when it starts producing coronavirus vaccines.**
Mr Johnson visited Wockhardt UK Ltd on Monday, which he said would be making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine if it is approved.
The PM said ""if we're lucky"" the vaccine could be available within weeks.
It was a very exciting and ""moving moment"", he added.
The Wrexham plant has the capability to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine a year and preparations to produce 150,000 vials a day of the vaccine have been under way for weeks.
As the drugs were being developed, preparations for transferring large vats of the vaccine into single-dose vials have been ramped up.
Ravi Limaye, managing director, said the company expected to start delivering the first doses of the vaccine soon.
""We are immensely proud to have been selected to partner with the UK government on this project,"" he said.
""We have a sophisticated sterile manufacturing facility and a highly skilled workforce.""
Unite union official Dave Griffiths said the Wrexham site had taken on 40 staff to deal with the demand and planned to produce 150,000 vials a day, five days a week."
"**A primary school has been temporarily closed after further confirmed cases of Covid 19 among its staff members.**
When several senior staff had to self-isolate at Norton Fitzwarren Primary School in Somerset, a risk assessment concluded that it should close for the rest of the week.
The school will be deep cleaned and the affected staff will continue to self-isolate.
The school has 289 pupils and is about three miles (about 5km) from Taunton.
A spokesperson for the school and Somerset County Council said: ""The safety and wellbeing of all children and staff is of paramount importance.
""We are working hard to get the school back up and running as soon as possible but do not want to compromise the operation of the school.""

Share this...FacebookTwitterGISS surface temperature data is overall in very close agreement with the RSS satellite data. But for some reason, the GISS winter temperature trend for the Arctic profoundly diverges from RSS satellite data.
===================================
GISS Ground Based Versus Satellite Temperatures
By Ed Caryl
In my article Cowtan and Way – Which bias was it again?, Figure 1 showed that the GISS temperature measurement for the Arctic north of 60° latitude was trending upward much faster than the satellite (RSS) data:

Figure 1: Annual temperature anomaly plots for land and ocean north of 60°.
The anomaly maps from GISS always show large warming areas in the Arctic areas warming faster than the global average. In my article titled A Light In Siberia, several surface stations seemed to be affected by Urban Heat Island warming phenomenon, even if they are small research outposts. This article will focus on winter warming of the northern latitudes.
First, GISS and RSS nearly agree on the warming of the entire globe in all seasons:

Figure 2: GISS and RSS annual global temperatures for the period 1980 to the present. Data from Woodfortrees.
The global trend for both plots is much less than in the trend depicted in Figure 1. Moreover, the GISS and RSS global trends are almost identical in slope. The offset simply reflects the baseline year difference used by the two data bases.
Next, Figure 3 shows the winter temperature trends for over 60° latitude in the northern hemisphere.

Figure 3: GISS and RSS northern hemisphere land and ocean winter temperatures. 
Here, the winter trend for the satellite data is less than the annual trend for RSS data in Figure 1, but the GISS trend is much greater than in Figure 1.
If heat-island problems are increasing the GISS trend, this shouldn’t show up in the summer when the outside temperature is much closer to the inside temperature at the measuring stations.

Figure 4: Summer trends in the Arctic.
In the summer, the GISS data and the RSS satellite data are nearly identical. In fact the satellite data shows an insignificant slightly higher trend.
Notice that the summer temperature trend is not continual, but took place in a step at 1997, the year of the super El Niño.  That step accounted for most of the 33-year rise. In that year the summer temperature trend changed, going from one flat level to a higher flat level, the present “pause”.
What happens when we exclude the ocean data in the winter? If heat-island is the problem, then it will appear as a marked increase in the GISS trend. And indeed it does:

Figure 5: GISS and RSS land data only for the Arctic. Note the major deviation that appears.
Here, at more than six tenths of a degree per decade, the GISS trend is highest of all. The RSS trend is only slightly more than the global annual trend. Arctic amplification is supposed to take place in a warming world. The poles are assumed to warm faster than the rest of the globe. This certainly isn’t taking place in the Antarctic. In the Arctic, only the summer is warming faster than the global average. This is seen in both data sets in Figure 4. In Figure 5, the RSS satellite data show no amplification, no warming greater than the global average. The GISS land station data warming trend increase must be all from winter heat-island effects.
What do we see in the southern hemisphere? Does it look anything like the Arctic?

Figure 6: GISS and RSS data (for as far south as the RSS data goes) for the southern hemisphere summer (January through February).
Above we see why the Antarctic ice is increasing. There has been summer cooling for over 30 years! Next let’s look at the Antarctic winter:

Figure 7 is a plot of GISS and RSS Antarctic winter temperature anomalies.
Both data sets largely agree on trends for summer and winter in the southern hemisphere. The winter temperatures show no long term trend, but a cooling since 1995 is apparent in the GISS data.
I have compared all the latitude bands available for both GISS and RSS data (not shown here). Only in the Arctic does the temperature trend between GISS and RSS differ by a large amount. For those that were impressed by the large red and orange Arctic areas due to map projection in the previous post, I offer the polar map plots for the same 1995 to the present temperature trend:

Figure 8 from GISS. A trend map from 1995 to the present of winter temperatures.
The above projection enlarges the polar regions slightly relative to the temperate regions, but it does show how much of the Arctic and Antarctic are missed. Dark red to yellow is warming, purple to light green is cooling. Now drop the color coding by 1.5 degrees for latitudes above 60° north to account for the extra heat-island warming. The satellite data says the average winter Arctic warming is only 0.5°C, not 1 to 7°C as the map above, or 2 to 2.5°C as the GISS data in Figure 5 suggests. 
For those that think the south pole is warming, I offer this web cam photo of the Amundson-Scott Station taken yesterday.

Figure 9 is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Webcam here.
Note the water vapor plume from the power plant and the size and color of the living and lab quarters. This infrastructure has been built and expanded since 1995. The previous building was buried in the ice. Now think about the heat island influence on local temperature at an average year-around temperature of minus 49° C.
Yes, there is man-made global warming! But it is largely by one heating system and power plant at a time. The warming is not at all due to CO2, it is due strictly to the Btu’s produced by burning fossil fuels for warmth and light in the winter. In the Arctic and Antarctic, these are primarily diesel and JP-8 jet fuel. The alternative is freezing to death in the dark.

"Amid the misery and chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there are some short-term consolations. The precipitous drop in road and air traffic has left the air cleaner and the skies clearer. For advocates of a Green New Deal (GND) – a vast, state-funded green infrastructure project, including a total transition to renewable energy and the construction of mass transit systems – there are reasons to be optimistic. As the severity of the unfolding global recession becomes clear – the IMF predicts a 3% global contraction – the GND looks like the best route to recovery.  The GND had been growing in popularity before the outbreak – including among establishment politicians, with all the leading Democratic presidential candidates expressing support for some form of it. But with 26 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks alone, and given that green industries are more efficient job creators than fossil-fuel ones, there is a powerful, immediate economic rationale for some kind of “green stimulus”. That is without even taking into account the longer-term economic case for decarbonizing: a 2018 US climate report calculated that the devastating effects of unchecked global warming will shrink the US economy by as much as 10% by the end of this century. But the economic fallout of Covid-19 has cast a harsher light on another strand of the climate movement, commonly termed “degrowth”. Influential among Extinction Rebellion activists, but often regarded as unrealistic by mainstream policymakers, degrowthers, as their name suggests, argue that uncontrolled economic growth is ecologically unsustainable and that to avert climate catastrophe we need to not only shut down the fossil-fuel industries but to reduce consumption overall. Degrowthers insist that we must find ways of living and working that do not require our economies to endlessly expand. Degrowthers have been particularly susceptible to caricature in recent weeks. “The coronavirus crisis reveals the misery of degrowth,” the Spectator predictably argued. But current living conditions – sudden mass joblessness, confinement and isolation, widespread food and income insecurity – are not a meaningful foretaste of greener things to come. The nightmare we are currently enduring is not degrowth’s secret dream come true; it is at most a grotesque parody of it, and one which is now liable to be weaponized by opponents of the movement. Reading the current moment as a repudiation of degrowth is premature and unjustified. It overlooks the distinction between what we are experiencing now – an unplanned, abrupt cessation of vast swaths of economic and social activity – and what advocates of degrowth envisage: a thoughtful, democratic, managed and equitable downsizing of the economy. Most degrowth advocates do not champion economic contraction as such, but argue for the necessity of adapting to the continuing, long-term global stagnation sometimes called “secular stagnation”. The fact that we can only think of slowing down our economies in terms of recession and austerity – with the associated cuts to public spending, growth in inequality and decline in real earnings – says much more about our political landscape than the economic facts. Yet there is one important criticism of degrowth that has been decisively bolstered by the sharp reversal in global economic fortunes resulting from the coronavirus lockdowns: the consequences for jobs. GDP is a notoriously crude and partial measure of a society’s wellbeing, failing to account for a whole host of indicative factors including equality, access to energy, the quality of healthcare, education and social support systems. But when GDP falls or slows because workers cannot produce goods or offer services, unemployment surges. Coronavirus has brought that reality dramatically home. As the economist and energy adviser Robert Pollin has written: “the immediate effect of any global GDP contraction would be huge job losses and declining living standards for working people and the poor. During the Great Recession, global unemployment rose by over 30 million. I have not seen a convincing argument from a degrowth advocate as to how we could avoid a severe rise in mass unemployment if GDP were to fall by twice as much.” The twin crises besetting us – the public health emergency and the unfolding economic trauma triggered by the measures to contain it – have laid bare much about the configuration of our world that we already knew but rarely fully apprehend: its interconnectedness, its fragility, its stark inequalities. But these crises have also brought into visceral relief the fact that employment is the heart and soul of the economy. As the British economist James Meadway has argued, the economic depression now upon us threatens “the most fundamental institution of all in capitalism: the labor market itself”. Since we have so little time left in which to stabilize the climate, we must be ruthlessly pragmatic in assessing the limitations of green strategies. Degrowth is no exception. The scale and speed of investment required to completely renovate the energy and transportation sectors does not seem conceivable without growth continuing, at least for the time being. Politically, as long as a steadily rising GDP remains an electoral necessity, it is difficult to imagine a recovery that doesn’t involve desperate efforts to restore growth – and not necessarily through greener means – by politicians anxious to revive flagging ratings. Yet to fixate on the question of growth risks exaggerating the differences between the Green New Dealers and degrowthers – elevating the former as practical-minded technocratic capitalists who want a return to normal economic activity, just motored by a different energy source, and dismissing the latter as abstemious, back-to-the-land utopians who want to deprive us of most of the luxuries of modern capitalist life. This in turn could lead to our learning only some of the lessons of the current predicament, and taking only some of the opportunities it offers. What both strands of climate thinking ask us to consider – and what the current crisis poses with special, brutal force, as phrases like “key workers” and “essential services” enter common parlance – is the question of what kinds of jobs we need, and what kinds our planet needs of us. Which goods and services are indispensable, and which would we be better off without? Degrowth and the GND offer different answers to this question – from green infrastructure construction to the care economy – but they both pose it, as well as raising important broader questions about how, how much and why we work. Once it is safe to emerge from economic survival mode, I hope we will have the wisdom to follow the lead of both movements by systematically reflecting on which kinds of productive activity actually enrich our lives – and which among these our planet can sustain.

"**A further 51 people in Wales have died with coronavirus, taking the total to 2,614.**
Public Health Wales data also showed 1,480 more people had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total to 82,489 since the beginning of the pandemic.
Of the newly reported deaths, there were 12 each in the Swansea Bay and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board areas.
A total of 11,047 new tests were carried out on Tuesday.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 11 new deaths, Aneurin Bevan reported eight, whilst Cardiff and Vale had four and Hywel Dda had three.
Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""It is now clear from the data that the Coronavirus cases are rising in most parts of Wales, reversing the downward trend we had observed as a result of the fire break.""
Blaenau Gwent currently has the highest rate of cases with 453.8 per 100,000 people.
Seven of Wales' 22 counties - Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Neath Port Talbot, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea, Newport and Rhondda Cynon Taf - currently have a case rate of more than 300.
Five counties have a case rate below 100, with Conwy and Gwynedd the lowest.
Neath Port Talbot has the highest positivity rate, with 20.1% of tests returning a positive result.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions.
More than 1.5 million tests have been taken in Wales since the start of the pandemic.
Acute patients from Powys are usually treated across the border at hospitals in England, so deaths of Powys residents usually only appear in registrations reported later by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Those ONS figures - which are higher - also count both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid, as well as deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's own homes. The most recent weekly figures are the highest since May.
PHW reports new deaths daily, but these are usually from previous days.

"**Holiday firm Lastminute.com has agreed to repay more than Â£7m owed to customers whose package holidays were cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.**
More than 9,000 customers are waiting for refunds, and the move follows pressure from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
The watchdog is currently chasing more than 100 package holiday firms to get refund commitments.
The travel sector has been deeply affected by the coronavirus crisis.
Lastminute.com was told to repay customers after hundreds of complaints that it was dragging its heels over refunds.
The firm has agreed to repay at least half of customers by 16 December and the rest by no later than 31 January 2021.
Anyone entitled to a refund for cancellations on or after Thursday 3 December will be paid within 14 days, the CMA added.
""Online travel agents have a legal responsibility to provide prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus - irrespective of whether the agent received refunds from airlines and accommodation providers,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA.
""Our action today means that customers whose holidays were cancelled by Lastminute.com will receive their money back without undue delay.""
Lastminute.com has been approached for comment.
In October, the CMA received a commitment from Virgin Holidays to refund all customers ""without undue delay"" after hundreds of complaints were made over delayed payments.
The watchdog also wrote to more than 100 package holiday firms in July to remind them of their refund obligations, and got commitments from Tui, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals to repay customers.
Package holiday customers are legally entitled to refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips.
But many people have been left waiting months for a pay-out during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis.
The travel and aviation industries have been hit by the coronavirus crisis in most parts of the world, with the International Air Transport Association warning in September that hundreds of thousands of jobs were at risk without more state aid.
The industry body said in November that London, which was previously the world's most connected city, had seen a 67% fall in connectivity in air travel.
London was overtaken by Shanghai, with the world's four most connected cities now all in China, where the coronavirus was first detected.
Air travel within China has broadly recovered and during its Golden Week holiday season 425 million people travelled around the country, according to the Chinese tourism ministry."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Saturday Summary (12/28 here) veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi comments on how humiliated global warming alarmist scientists are trying to save face by claiming that all the new polar sea ice proves global warming.
Antarctic sea ice has been approaching record highs and embarrassed alarmist scientists are scrambling to explain why.
After presenting his weather information, at the 7:10 mark Joe gets to the nitty-gritty on climate.

Global sea ice 1 million square kilometers above normal. Cropped from Saturday Summary.
Now, I’ve got to do this because the global warming agenda is just really despicable in trying to claim the increase in Antarctic sea ice, opposite of what they said several years ago, and now they are trying to deny they said that, is a sign of global warming.”
Makes you wonder if climate scientists put water in the oven at home to try to make ice cubes.

Arctic sea ice has leveled off
Joe also shows Arctic sea ice has actually leveled off over the last few years, attributing the earlier reduction to oceanic cycles.
Later at the 8:15 mark Joe again sharply criticizes the shenanigans of climate alarmists, accusing scientists of lying with respect to Antarctic sea ice increase:
I’ll tell you what, now I cannot say how despicable it is to see the lying that is going on as you watch the Antarctic ice shelf continue to increase […] It’s just amazing listening to all this going on.”
Joe later says that what’s going on in Antaractica is just a classic example of cyclical climate.
One thing is clear: climate science shows that scruples are in short supply within the field.

"One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it’s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament. The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution. She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone – maybe a constituent or the local paper – would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. “I thought I might get a bit of pushback,” she told me. “I’ve had absolutely zero.” This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to strengthen these targets, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition – in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we’re all in favour of climate action, but we haven’t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions. I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we’re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It’s easier to look away. In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything will be different. If, as I’ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away? Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts – and a political strategy that will allow this to happen – has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed. I’ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair’s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law. Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. “I don’t remember it being one of the big issues,” she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, “I remember it going on in the background, but it wasn’t something that had high temperature”. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change – and then carried on as normal. That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn’t understand what it was all about? With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs’ questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians – ministers or frontbenchers – to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party. Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a “penny-drop moment”, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more – and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don’t act. And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives. We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own renewable energy projects. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren’t they doing more? I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs – 23 in all – to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, number of known “climate sceptic” MPs, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change. I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence. All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate “terrified” him. “Where we’re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn’t fancy our chances.” I asked why, if it’s so significant, it wasn’t discussed much in parliament. But he didn’t answer. He couldn’t, or didn’t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him. Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn’t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn’t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate. It’s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: “You might not get into double figures.” She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as tax breaks for oil and gas exploration. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: “I think they’d just think you were a bit ‘niche’, is the way I’d put it – I say ‘niche’ in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.” One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: “I was known as being a freak.” Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a “zealot”. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. “I don’t use climate change as the word because I think it’s just toxic,” he told me. “As is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won’t take people with you politically.” This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine – and politicians are no exception. Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn’t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, having to resort to artificial snow – something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives. Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: “How could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible – simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?” She labelled this phenomenon “socially organised denial”. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn’t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and “with nature”. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged. Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels. As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry “cannot be shut down overnight”. She’s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere – not overnight, but urgently. The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I’ve come to think of as the “feelgood fallacy”. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won’t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas – yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this. If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it’s burned, not where it’s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions. Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, “I’ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters … and I just don’t have conversations about climate change.” Many of these conversations took place before the school climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests began in 2018 – these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK’s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as “almost like being a parent. It’s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.” Exactly how a politician “represents” the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying”: “I am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.” This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate – a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end – it’s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate. They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: “I’m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.” Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, “there would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: ‘Oh, here he goes again.’” Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option. There’s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don’t speak out, people don’t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don’t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move. But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like? In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional environmental benefits of lockdown. It’s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is in no way a model for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls. What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why. Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite – handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy. If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a Green New Deal. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward a plan aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare. Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour’s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate. A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens’ assemblies. Early this year, Climate Assembly UK got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament. Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there’s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats – not least, those arising from climate change. Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can’t govern in a vacuum. We can’t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician’s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn’t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful. Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

I’m sure many WUWT readers on both sides of the AGW debate watched Mitt Romney’s acceptance speech last night. The most memorable line that got a standing ovation was a poke back at Obama’s famous line – “I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children … this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” given at his acceptance speech in 2008.
Marc Morano of Climate Depot has the story about how some folks are upset about that. Mike Mann, since he doesn’t have anything else to do since being put on “sabbatical” is of course given the opportunity to refute. He’s the ‘go to guy’ now that Gore has imploded.

Politico: Romney’s climate change remark makes waves
By Alex Guillen
8/30/12 11:29 PM EDT
Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s climate change position during his acceptance speech Thursday.
“President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet,” Romney said after accepting the GOP’s presidential nomination in Tampa, drawing laughter from the crowd. “My promise is to help you and your family.”
The line received a standing ovation.
Romney was referring to now-famous remarks Obama made in 2008 after securing the Democratic nomination. “I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children … this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”
A needless slam on science? That’s how it appeared to Penn State climate researcher Michael Mann.
“How sad it is to witness such fallacious logic from a major party candidate for president,” Mann, one of the nation’s best-known climate researchers, told POLITICO. “If we do not take the necessary actions to combat climate change now, we will of course be leaving our children and grandchildren the legacy of a degraded planet.”
[…]
Marc Morano, publisher of the climate skeptic blog Climate Depot, predicted that Romney’s line from Thursday’s speech will be memorable.
“Kudos to Romney for an accurate framing of the global warming debate,” he said. “Romney’s quip will serve to remind voters just how lofty Obama’s rhetoric once was. Romney’s reminder of Obama’s promise to command the oceans will be one of the most memorable lines of the speech.”
Romney’s speech also included a reiteration of his promise to achieve North American energy independence by 2020 “by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables.”

I agree with Dr. Michael Mann, candidate Obama’s statement about healing the planet was indeed “fallacious logic”, especially in lieu of his track record on climate now. – Anthony

"Prince Charles is among those repeating their calls for an organised cull of grey squirrels in Britain as a way of helping the declining native red squirrel.  Despite being larger and stronger than their red cousins, living in denser numbers and out-competing red squirrels for the same food, it is predominantly the virulent squirrelpox disease that greys carry that has driven red squirrel populations from all but a few areas in northern England and Scotland. A recent paper on conservation management by Andy White at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and colleagues uses red and grey squirrels as a case study, arguing for better control in cases of invasive species whose effects are disease-driven. Another useful study by Pia Schuchert at the University of Newcastle and colleagues examines grey squirrel control over 13 years between 1998 and 2010, and finds that typically they were effective in bringing down grey squirrel numbers, and also lowering the numbers that carried squirrelpox. With Prince Charles keen on organic food and support for local butchers growing, no doubt he’d approve of putting this squirrel bounty to some culinary use. As we did, at the sixth annual squirrel cook-off in the Six Bells pub, near Cambridge, with 23 dishes of grey squirrel snacks. The dishes reflected the very different directions of the cooks: curried Bollywood squirrel, squirrel in filo pastry, squirrel pie, squirrel eggs in a nest, and the winning dish of squirrel sausages. Using legally trapped or shot grey squirrels as food has been in vogue for a few years now, a trend picked up back in 2008 when the Guardian newspaper proposed squirrel as “the ultimate ethical meal”. Being a food science and nutrition lecturer who is involved in and teaches food culture, I am not averse to eating a whole range of different animals for food, if humanely killed. Grey squirrels have the advantage of being low in fat, low in food miles – an estimated five million in Britain and counting, available almost everywhere – and obviously entirely free range. As a culinary experiment last year a friend presented me with two squirrels which I skinned and gutted and cooked in two different ways. The first was as a red wine, juniper berry and mushroom casserole, which friends pronounced to be too strong and gamey. This was perhaps due to using the male squirrel – the female used for the favoured dish of squirrel flamed with brandy and then lightly cooked with cream and hazelnuts, was milder, like a slightly gamey chicken.  So being presented with two skinned and cleaned squirrels in a plastic bag to prepare and cook was not too daunting. To remove any taint a light brine was used and then a marinade of ginger flavoured cider, casseroling with garlic, more cider and thyme. The meat was then removed and added to a roux sauce with mushrooms, cream and hazelnuts, chilled and then used to fill 40 small croustades. It may not have won, but only three were left at the end of the judging and tasting. But are squirrels any healthier than, say, chicken? The US Department of Agriculture’s National Nutrient Database provides the nutritional content of a very wide range of foods, including various game meats. According to the records, per 100g the squirrel has more protein (31g) and less fat (5g) than roasted chicken (29g and 9g), stewed chicken (27g and 7g), or venison (26g and 8g). In fact only rabbit, at 33g and 3.5g, provides a more protein-rich and low-fat meal.  However, low-fat and high-protein comes with its own drawbacks – the syndrome known as “rabbit starvation” experienced by hunter-gatherers and subsistence dwellers of northern latitudes, and recorded by Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Steffanson, stems from a diet with insufficient fat; rabbit meat alone is simply too lean. So with all the greys living on the estates at Prince Charles’ disposal and the professional chefs employed by his Duchy Original brand, I’m keen to see the day that royalty-approved squirrel snacks make their first appearance. Certainly, judging by the varied approaches taken by those in the Six Bells there’s plenty of options out there."

UPDATE: Forecast humor on steroids, here
You can’t make up FAIL like this. First this story in the BBC Today:

Now let’s have a look at the official Met Office forecast for April, issued on March 23rd, 2012: 
Met Office 3-month Outlook
Period: April – June 2012 Issue date: 23.03.12
SUMMARY – PRECIPITATION:
The forecast for average UK rainfall slightly favours drier than average conditions for April-May-June as a whole, and also slightly favours April being the driest of the 3 months. With this forecast, the water resources situation in southern, eastern and central England is likely to deteriorate further during the April-May-June period. The probability that UK precipitation for April-May-June will fall into the driest of our five categories is 20-25% whilst the probability that it will fall into the wettest of our five categories is 10-15% (the 197-2000 climatological probability for each of these categories is 20%).
CONTEXT:
As a legacy of dry weather over many months water resources in much
of southern, eastern and central England remain at very low levels.
Winter rainfall in these areas has typically been about 70% of average,
whilst observations and current forecasts suggest that the final totals for
March will be below average here too. The Environment Agency advises
that, given the current state of soils and groundwater levels in these
areas, drought impacts in the coming months are virtually inevitable.
Read the entire forecast here: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/p/i/A3-layout-precip-AMJ.pdf
Saved copy here: Met_Office_A3-layout-precip-AMJ
Obviously, the power sucking supercomputer they recently put online needs to be bigger.
It is capable of 1,000 billion calculations every second to feed data to 400 scientists and uses 1.2 megawatts of energy to run – enough to power more than 1,000 homes.

GIGO me thinks. This isn’t the first time this has happened:
Red Faces At The Met Office
Met Office admits they botched snow warning
And then there’s the BBQ summer fiasco, which prompted replacement of the seasonal forecasts with the shorter term one you see above:
Met Office ends season forecasts – no more “BBQ summers”
Maybe they should stick to DART (Digital Advanced Reckoning Technology) which  can do the job of making forecasts equally well, using less power, less space, and less money:

"Global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to slump this year after countries and industries shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but Australia’s electricity grid appears immune. An analysis found the reduced economic activity over a five-week period was likely to have cut emissions from the country’s coal-dominated power generation by only about 1% compared with previous years. Total electricity consumption between 16 March and 21 April was 2.4% lower than last year, but more than half of that drop was likely attributable to it being warmer in 2019 in that period, leading to people running power-hungry air-conditioners more often. The report by Hugh Saddler, an energy analyst who writes a monthly national emissions audit for thinktank The Australia Institute, also underscores the pace at which renewable energy generation has increased. It provided more than 50% of power for nearly two hours in the middle of the day on Easter Saturday, the first time this happened for more than a few minutes. From December to March, distributed rooftop solar power provided 16.3% of electricity in South Australia and 7.7% in Queensland, up from 10.1% and 5.3% respectively two years ago. Within the grid, renewable energy was 24.9% of generation. Saddler, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said while Australia expected to see a significant fall in emissions from both road transport and aviation due to the virus shutdown when data became available, electricity and gas use had held up. “Given the disruptive nature of the pandemic and its effects on sectors like transport, it might surprise some that the fall in carbon emissions from electricity, the most polluting sector in Australia, has been so small,” he said. Saddler said Australia differed from some of the worst affected countries in that major energy users in Australia, such as mining, mineral processing and manufacturing operations, had mostly stayed open. Air-conditioning and lighting had continued to run in many shopping centres, offices, hotels and education centres though fewer people were using them, and household electricity use rose as people stayed home. While total national emissions had remained mostly flat under the Coalition prior to the pandemic, electricity emissions have been reducing as a wave of clean energy has come online, driven by the rapidly falling cost of wind and solar technology and the 2020 renewable energy target. Investment in large-scale clean generation slowed last year after the target was filled and not replaced, and delays in building transmission infrastructure. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said the pandemic risked slowing the power grid’s move towards a higher proportion of clean power if governments heeded a call from the Australian Energy Council, representing generators, retailers and networks, to use it to delay electricity market reforms. “Electricity emissions have been slightly dented but there has been no real change, and things could get worse if the federal government upgrades and extends coal clunkers as part of the pandemic recovery package,” he said. The report also examined the emissions contained in Australia’s east-coast liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. It found the embodied emissions being shipped from Gladstone to Asia as LNG had a much larger carbon footprint than the emissions from gas-fired power plants in the national grid."

The government of China finally confirmed that it has detained the artist Ai Weiwei. Meanwhile, Evan Osnos writes from Beijing for the _New Yorker_ about China's ""Big Chill"": 



Step by step—so quietly, in fact, that the full facts of it can be startling—China has embarked on the most intense crackdown on free expression in years. Overshadowed by news elsewhere in recent weeks, China has been rounding up writers, lawyers, and activists since mid-February, when calls began to circulate for protests inspired by those in the Middle East and North Africa. By now the contours are clear: according to a count by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, the government has “criminally detained 26 individuals, disappeared more than 30, and put more than 200 under soft detention.”



Indeed, everywhere I turn today, there's news about Chinese censorship and fear of dissent, of ideas, of art, of words like ""luxury."" The _Washington Post_ has a major article on Bob Dylan's concert Wednesday night in Beijing. Dylan, the troubadour of the peace movement and the Sixties and civil rights, in the capital of the world's largest Communist party-state. How'd that go? Ask Keith Richburg, whose _Post_ article is titled ""The times they are a-censored"": 



Rock music icon Bob Dylan avoided controversy Wednesday in his first-ever appearance in Communist-led China, eschewing the 1960s protest anthems that defined a generation and sticking to a song list that government censors say they preapproved, before a crowd of about 5,000 people in a Soviet-era stadium.   
  
Keeping with his custom, Dylan never spoke to the crowd other than to introduce his five-member band in his raspy voice. And his set list – which mixed some of his newer songs alongside classics made unrecognizable by altered tempos — was devoid of any numbers that might carry even the whiff of anti-government overtones.   
  
In Taiwan on Sunday, opening this spring Asian tour, Dylan played “Desolation Row” as the eighth song in his set and ended with an encore performance of “Blowin’ in the Wind,” whose lyrics became synonymous with the antiwar and civil rights protest movements.   
  
But in China, where the censors from the government’s Culture Ministry carefully vet every line of a song before determining whether a foreign act can play here, those two songs disappeared from the repertoire. In Beijing, Dylan sang “Love Sick” in the place of “Desolation Row,” and he ended his nearly two-hour set with the innocent-sounding “Forever Young.”   
  
There was no “Times They Are a-Changin’ ” in China. And definitely no “Chimes of Freedom.”



Meanwhile, NPR reports that Beijing has banned words such as ""luxury,"" ""supreme,"" ""regal,"" and ""high-class"" on billboards: 



The city's new rules state that ads must not glorify ""hedonism, feudal emperors, heavenly imperial nobility"" or anything vulgar, according to the _Global Times_ newspaper. They also should not violate ""spiritual construction"" standards or worship foreign products — leading some to believe the campaign could be targeting foreign luxury goods.   
  
""The truth is that the party has very clearly started what is very clearly a campaign against ostentation in China,"" says David Wolf of Wolf Group Asia, a communications advisory agency. ""There is a pushback against things Western. And there is the desire to see those Western things take a lesser role in the development of Chinese culture.""...   
  
_China Daily_ reports that the campaign is aimed at protecting social harmony, quoting a sociologist who says advertisements that promote the belief that ""wealth is dignity"" could upset low-income residents.



Now there's some good old-fashioned communist thinking! Of course, communists with the courage of their convictions would ban the products, not just the ad copy. But it's nice to see the old values survive.   
  
In some ways the government's confirmation that it has detained Ai Weiwei is the most chilling indication of the new climate. It came in an editorial in _Global Times_ , a vigorous presenter of the government line. Just listen to the combative language: 



Ai Weiwei likes to do something ""others dare not do."" He has been close to the red line of Chinese law....   
  
The West ignored the complexity of China's running judicial environment and the characteristics of Ai Weiwei's individual behavior. They simply described it as China's ""human rights suppression.""   
  
""Human rights"" have really become the paint of Western politicians and the media, with which they are wiping off the fact in this world.   
  
""Human rights"" are seen as incompatible things with China's great economic and social progress by the West. It is really a big joke. Chinese livelihood is developing, the public opinion no longer follows the same pattern all the time and ""social justice"" has been widely discussed. Can these be denied? The experience of Ai Weiwei and other mavericks cannot be placed on the same scale as China's human rights development and progress.



As I've written before, China faces a dilemma. They have opened up their economy and reaped huge benefits, perhaps the largest advance in human well-being in the history of the world -- as the editors of _Global Times_ defiantly argue. But if China wants to become known as a center of innovation and progress, not just a military superpower or a manufacturer, it will need to open further. Investors want to put money into a country with the rule of law. Creative people want to live in a country that allows them to read, write, think, and act freely.   
  
Way back in 1979, David Ramsay Steele, author of _From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation,_ wrote about the changes beginning in China. He quoted authors in the official _Beijing Review_ who were explaining that China would adopt the good aspects of the West--technology, innovation, entrepreneurship--without adopting its liberal values. ""We should do better than the Japanese,"" the authors wrote. ""They have learnt from the United States not only computer science but also strip-tease. For us it is a matter of acquiring the best of the developed capitalist countries while rejecting their philosophy."" But, Steele replied, countries like China have a choice. ""You play the game of catallaxy, or you do not play it. If you do not play it, you remain wretched. But if you play it, _you must play it_. You want computer science? Then you have to put up with strip-tease.""   
  
How much freedom can China's rulers tolerate? How much repression will its citizens tolerate? How many ambitious, creative Chinese will leave the world's largest market to find more creative freedom elsewhere? These may be the most important questions in the world over the next generation.

"The sudden sharp fall in greenhouse gas emissions recorded in the early part of this year may seem like an environmental blessing, a breathing space as the world fights climate breakdown. Skies clear of aeroplanes and streets free of cars have encouraged the return of nature and brought visions of a cleaner world. Carbon dioxide emissions had fallen by 17% on average by early April, according to a definitive study published in Nature Climate Change on Tuesday, as a result of the lockdown measures put in place around the world to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.  In fact, the unprecedented decline is “nothing to celebrate”, according to leading experts. It will be temporary and will make little difference to the world’s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and stave off catastrophic levels of global heating. The causes of the steep fall, the economic convulsions and the possibility of lasting economic damage also mean urgent work must be done to repair the economy. “This decline in emissions, the biggest in history, is the result of economic trauma,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, whose own analysis backs up the Nature paper in showing this is the biggest drop in carbon in history. “It is nothing to celebrate. It is not the result of policy. This decline will be easily erased if the right policy measures are not put in place.” Dave Reay, a professor of carbon management at Edinburgh University, called the paper “sobering stuff” as it revealed the massive changes made to cope with the pandemic would have only a minor effect on emissions, and the climate. “All those billions of lockdown sacrifices and privations have made just a small and likely transient dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. Covid-19 is no help on climate change – it is a devastating scourge.” “None of this is good news for anyone,” added Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer in climate change at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. “It is the symptom of a massive economic disruption caused by the pandemic and the measures to contain it. For the climate, this month-long wake in otherwise record-high emissions is entirely insignificant.” What is to come might be worse still, he warned, if governments around the world seek to kickstart the global economy out of its pandemic recession by pouring public money into projects that prop up existing industries and increase our dependence on fossil fuels. For instance, sectors including aviation, car manufacturing and fossil fuel production have been hard hit by the lockdowns, and many companies are hoping for bailouts using public money. “Massive economic stimulus measures are now being announced and there is a high risk that short-sightedness will lead governments to lose track of the bigger picture by putting their money towards highly polluting sectors that have no place in a zero-pollution and zero-carbon society,” said Rogelj. Campaigners said the world must make the right choices on how to rebuild after the pandemic. They have called, along with leading economists, for a green recovery that would concentrate any stimulus cash on projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution, as well as generating jobs and increasing prosperity. “When we move forward from this terrible situation, we have to make sure we hold on to the gains we’ve made in better air quality, lower carbon emissions and simple things like hearing birdsong,” said Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Councils should start by permanently changing how road space is used, allocating more to encourage walking and cycling, and making public transport work for everyone. Now is the time to scrap plans to expand airports and introduce a levy on the most frequent flyers.” Governments facing such choices have a clear blueprint on how to ensure the recovery is green and sustainable, said Paul Morozzo, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “We know how to do it. We have to rebuild our cities around walking, cycling and public transport. We’ve got to create hundreds of thousands of jobs upscaling renewable energy and insulating people’s homes. Let’s learn from this tragedy, build back better and not make the mistake of ignoring the next crisis [of climate breakdown] heading our way.”"
"

The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has recently reached a “milestone” of 400 parts per million (ppm). In some circles, this announcement has been met with consternation and gnashing of teeth. The proper reaction is celebration.   
  
  
The growth in the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past several centuries is primarily the result of mankind’s thirst for energy—largely in the form of fossil fuels. According to the World Bank, fossil fuel energy supplies about 80% of the world’s energy production—a value which has been pretty much constant for the past 40 years. During that time, the global population increased by 75%, and global energy use doubled. Global per capita energy use increased, while global energy use per $1000 GDP declined. We are using more energy, but we are using it more efficiently. In the developed world, life expectancy has doubled since the dawn of the fossil fuel era.   
  
  
Of course, burning fossil fuels to produce energy results in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, tipping the natural balance of annual CO2 flux and leading to a gradual build‐​up.   
  
  
There are two primary externalities that result from our emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere—1) an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, which results in an alteration of the energy flow in the earth’s climate and a general tendency to warm the global average surface temperature, and 2) an enhancement of the rate of photosynthesis in plants and a general tendency to result in more efficient growth and an overall healthier condition of vegetation (including crops). There’s incontrovertible evidence that the planet is both warmer and greener than it was 100 years ago.   
  
  
As we continually document (see here for our latest post), more and more science is suggesting that the rate (and thus magnitude at any point in time) of CO2‐​induced climate change is not as great as commonly portrayed. The lower the rate of change, the lower the resulting impact. If the rate is low enough, carbon dioxide emissions confer a net benefit. We’d like to remind readers that “it’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity,” when it comes to carbon dioxide, and the sensitivity appears to have been overestimated.   
  
  
As new science erodes the foundation of climate worry, new technologies are expanding recoverable fossil fuel resources. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have opened up vast expanses of fossil fuel resources—mainly natural gas—that were untouchable just a few years ago. The discovery that the world is awash in hundreds of years of recoverable fuels is a game‐​changer, given the strong correlation between energy use per capita and life expectancy.   
  
  
400ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should remind us of our continuing success at expanding the global supply of energy to meet a growing demand. That success which ultimately leads to an improvement of the global standard of living and a reduction in vulnerability to the vagaries of weather and climate.   
  
  
400pm is cause for celebration. “A world lit only by fire” is not.

"London’s Victorian sewerage system is creaking and in dire need of renewal. The proposed solution: a 25km “super-sewer”, the Thames Tideway Tunnel, running from west to east across the capital at an estimated cost of £4.2 billion.  Thames Water wants to build the tunnel, but its owner, an international consortium of investors led by the Australian bank, Macquarie Group, has encountered a slight hitch: there’s not enough money to fund the upgrade. It seems there is too little equity left in the business and too much debt – the company has been leveraged up to the hilt, to the extent that it wants someone else to pay for the tunnel.  In common with other investment consortia that own much of the water industry in England, Thames Water has been loaded up with debt since privatisation. The debt is now some £8 billion, amounting to around four-fifths of the business, a gearing of just under 80%. In itself, such high leverage is not necessarily a problem, unless,  that is, you want to borrow more money. Then you run the risk of damaging your credit rating. But the investors have a plan.  They’ve set up a separate business, a special-purpose vehicle, to deliver the tunnel, neatly sidestepping any credit rating concerns. But the cost of the tunnel renewal is to be effectively funded from household water bills, meaning an 11% increase for Thames Water’s 14m customers, up to 2020. So, because it doesn’t have the money, Thames Water wants its customers to help pay for the super-sewer.  This is odd, perhaps, when you come to think about it. The privatisation of household water was sold to us in the 1980s as part of the wider Thatcherite drive to address the inefficiency of the public-sector providers by opening utilities to private-sector finance and management. The private sector was not slow in accepting the invitation. So what happened to all the finance and management? In some ways, the water industry in England and Wales today looks much like it did at the time of privatisation in 1989. But after 25 years, only the trading names remain the same as before, with the public as a shareholder increasingly displaced by global consortia, pension and other specialist infrastructure funds.  Behind the familiar company logos, the companies that run Thames, Anglian, Southern and Yorkshire Water have led the way in engineering water bills for financial gain. The asset that interests them, however, is not actually water, but people: households with the ability to pay water bills on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.  In the hands of a Macquarie-led consortium, such a guaranteed revenue stream presents a securitisation opportunity, that is, a means to package up a debt with the prospects of future revenue. Leveraging debt through securitisation allows revenue streams from underlying assets, in this case, Thames Water’s bill-paying customers, to be packaged together, bonds issued against them, and then sold on to investors. Crucially, securitisation represents a claim against the cash that flows from household water bills in the future – a guarantee of money which customers have yet to be billed. It is a form of refinancing that leaves Thames Water’s balance sheet short of equity, but with a mound of leveraged debt. Of course, this debt could be used to lower household water bills or finance infrastructure development. But it may also be used to pay higher shareholder dividends.  Companies such as Thames Water, it turns out, have been paying out in dividends far more than they actually earn from their cash flows and using the borrowed money to fund substantial dividends for the best part of a decade – money that could have been used to finance the Thames Tideway Tunnel.  The structuring and crafting of such deals like this are a relatively new development, one which arrived after the onset of privatisation and which left the water regulator Ofwat in a position of having to adjust to the new financial reality.  Ofwat operates a regulatory ring-fence. So long as the water companies don’t allow their debt liabilities to interfere with their core water business, it’s pretty much left to them as to how much debt they take on. But the ring-fence, in the case of Thames Water, is looking as leaky as its decaying sewers. The mound of debt taken on by Thames Water now means that it can’t raise the money to renew its infrastructure. Someone else – probably its bill-paying customers – will have to take on that burden.  If the political spotlight focused a little more brightly on the new financial reality of privatised water, you might get a reaction of the kind that has taken place in Berlin or in Copenhagen. The former has seen a re-municipalisation of water utilities, the latter protests against the machinations of Goldman Sachs in the Danish energy market. We could do worse than take a look at Welsh Water’s not-for-profit model. With no shareholders, the money from household water bills goes towards financing new infrastructure development and, if there’s a surplus, towards the payment of an annual customer dividend. Thatcher, we suspect, might even have approved."

Recently I wrote an article on the subject of [reverse racism](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/reverse-racism-benefits-no-one/) in New Zealand. A further perusal of A Weekend Newspaper only reinforced my view.



I reached page 10 and was told by one of the greatest purveyors of left-wing drivel, **Simon Wilson** , that the clamour for change is rising and Ihumatao is Jacinda Ardern’s historic moment. Will she take it? On page 16 Lizzie Marvelly informs me Ihumatao is **a complex case of Maori oppression.**



Dealing with Simon, though it pains me to do so, he also talks about Oranga Tamariki and how both conflicts involve Maori against Pakeha and Maori against Maori. They have overtones of tradition v modernity and youth v age. Also of women v men, moderates v radicals. Simon points out in both disputes Maori on both sides have said enough to **colonial injustice.** It only took to paragraph three for that constant refrain to raise its ugly head.



Let’s, for a moment, look at those differences he points out. He has just painted a picture of everything that’s gone wrong with the politics of the Left today. Globally. Pelosi v The Squad. They are in a total and utter shambles. 



Simon asks did Ardern notice, with Ihumatao as with climate change, how the world of protest has filled up with young people. As that’s the age group she spends most of her time with the answer is probably yes. We certainly have noticed Simon and are none too impressed. We have kids wandering out of school, no doubt on the basis of scaremongering by some idiot leftie teacher who’s told them that the world is about to end. If you want to spend the rest of your life living in fear Simon, go ahead but keep the nonsense to yourself. Next minute the kids will be having lessons on how to build an ark.



Simon asks if anyone told Ardern about the 29-year-old Pania Newton and says what a courageous, determined and remarkably gifted leader she is. Isn’t it enough to make you want to curl up into a ball and weep! Donald Trump is putting up with similar, the Cortez woman for one. 



Simon says the days of deliberately taking what we can from Maori, just because we can, and hiding behind self-serving laws to defend the action, are over. Excuse my French but where the bloody hell has he been for the last forty or fifty years as we the taxpayers have, **quite rightly, shelled out billions in compensation** for land confiscations. It is disturbing to say the least that, having paid an over-inflated price for ‘A Newspaper’, (no doubt due to falling sales), we are faced with having to read this sort of claptrap. 



Simon bemoans the fact that the law has enabled the creation of private wealth for Fletchers at the expense of the cultural and historical wealth of the people of the land and of the citizens of the city. So what is Fletcher’s supposed to do on land they legally own? Build affordable homes for free? Simon, of course, fails to mention that **Fletchers has agreed to return some of the land.** Typical Left-wing reporting. Don’t let the facts get in the way of the story. 



Simon would do well to talk to iwi advocate Pita Turei who says that the land being used for urban development is **not ancient burial grounds** as SOUL would suggest but was in fact wheat fields. Pita says the big myth here is that the stone fields are under threat, they are not.



So, in essence, this week I have spent money buying ‘A Newspaper’ to read two articles, one by a mature gentleman and another by a young lady, both using a myth to further their personal crusades. Having skewered Simon, Lizzie’s next for a roasting.



As for Jacinda’s historic moment, that will be when she leaves office and that moment can’t come soon enough!



PS. Anyone game to bet that Simon’s next article will be on the lack of affordable housing for Maori?

"**A tier one hotel which could reopen when lockdown ends will stay closed due to the loss of potential guests from higher tier areas.**
The owners of Best Western Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall said a combination of cancellations and a lack of new bookings made opening unviable.
They said it was best to close the hotel to ""reduce costs and protect the jobs of our loyal staff"".
England's regions will be placed in one of three tiers from 2 December.
Cornwall has been placed in tier one which has the most relaxed restrictions.
But those living in a tier two area must continue to follow tier two rules when travelling to a tier one area and those living in tier three should avoid travelling outside of their area altogether.
The hotel's owners said these restrictions ""prevent us from hosting our usual Christmas parties and winter functions that keep this business viable"".
They added: ""We do not consider that we will be able to attract sufficient overnight guests at an adequate average room rate to make opening worthwhile.
""At this time, we propose to remain closed until at least the end of January 2021.""
Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight are the only areas of England in the lowest level of curbs - tier one.
The tier system will be regularly reviewed, with the first scheduled for 16 December, so an area's tier level may change before Christmas, Downing Street said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German print weekly FOCUS has a short article on the inside workings of climate research funding (see below, right). It appears there’s a good ol’ boys network between the German Environment Ministry and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research – one that apparently violates the laws for awarding research contracts.
The title of the FOCUS piece: Umweltbundesfilz. In English: Federal environmental sleaze.
FOCUS writes that the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) – an arm of the Federal Environment Ministry –  awarded the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) about a dozen research contracts worth some 2 million euros since 2007. According to the law, government institutes and agencies are required to publicly call for tenders Europe-wide. This was not done.
FOCUS writes:
Explosive: The responsible department director of the UBA, Harry Lehmann, is a member of the ‘Verein der Freunde und Förderer des Potsdam-lnstituts’. And according to its charter, the association is to support the Potsdam Institute ‘foremost with the procurement of resources’.”
For non-German readers the quoted association’s name translates in English to “Society of Friends and Promoters of the Potsdam Institute“.
So it looks like we have a director in a federal institute busy funneling research contracts to an institute he is actively supporting in private, and thus skirting the legal requirements on the bidding process for public research contracts.
But this type of favoritism from the UBA should not surprise us at all, as blatant favoritism is nothing new for the activist agency. Just two months ago the UBA tried to tell the public which scientists and journalists to believe on the subject of climate science.

FOCUS adds:
Lehmann is the author of the controversial climate change brochure where scientists and journalists were disqualified for being unserious because they were critical of the Potsdam Institute. The chief editor of research and technology at FOCUS was among those who were defamed.”
That FOCUS chief editor happens to be veteran journalist Michael Miersch.
The UBA and the PIK of course deny the allegations, claiming a legal exception clause applies in the awarding of the contracts. But legal experts are most doubtful about that assertion.
The awarding practices of the UBA are ‘a massive and obviously frequent violation of the contract awarding law,’ assesses contract award law expert Heiko Höfler. The UBA defends the controversial awards and claims they fall the under the ‘award legal exemption clause’. Höfler is not convinced: ‘This is absolutely not what is intended, according to the contract conditions of the Agency. There’s a lot indicating that this is all about a lie to cover oneself.'”
In summary, the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) is not only informing the public that the PIK is the keeper of climate science truth, but it looks like its director is illegally circumventing public contract bidding laws and funneling contracts to the PIK, to which he is member of its support society.
Nice to see journalists digging into this. Who knows what else will be uncovered in the science swamp that surrounds the PIK. With a definite pattern of inappropriate behavior becoming increasingly clear, there’s likely lots more to uncover.

"**Officers in England handed out 1,977 fines for breaches of Covid lockdown rules in the first two weeks of November, according to new police data.**
The largest number of fines were issued in north-west England which, along with Leicester, has now been under the longest period of restrictions.
Greater Manchester Police has handed out the most tickets (309) since the lockdown began on 5 November.
Merseyside Police issued 277 fines and there were another 178 in Lancashire.
The figures, published by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on Monday, show that officers in Leicestershire have issued 30 fines under the November lockdown laws.
Police chiefs believe the significant difference between the areas may be down to the willingness of people to comply with requests from officers to break up a gathering, along with the amount of police time that has been allocated to investigations, according to the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani.
Overall, 24,993 fines were handed out by officers in England and Wales for breaches of coronavirus rules between 27 March and 16 November.
On face coverings, the NPCC figures showed 641 tickets were issued between 15 June and 16 November, including 169 on public transport, an average of eight per week.
The remaining 472 were handed out in relevant places such as shops. The weekly number rose sharply to 78 between 2 October and 8 October, and has ranged between 43 and 91 since then.
The NPCC said up to the 24 November, there were 416 occasions where officers found an individual in breach of quarantine rules after travel abroad. No further action was taken after the person was successfully encouraged to self-isolate.
The figures show that in 7,040 cases travel quarantine rules were being followed, while on the 586 occasions officers visited the address of someone who was supposed to be self-isolating, they found nobody with the relevant name lived there.
Another 862 investigations were abandoned after officers found nobody was home.
The figures show that up to 16 November, police in England issued 223 tickets to people failing to self-isolate after arriving from a country on the government's quarantine list.
Meanwhile, preliminary crime figures also published by the NPCC on Monday showed that police recorded crime in England and Wales was down 9% in October this year compared to 2019, including a drop of 18% in serious violent crime.
There was a 2% rise in recorded domestic abuse incidents, the NPCC added."
"**India's first female comic superhero Priya, a gang-rape survivor who earlier campaigned against rape, acid attack and sex trafficking, is back to fight disinformation around the Covid-19 pandemic.**
In Priya's Mask, due to be launched on 2 December, the comic crusader joins hands with Jiya, the ""Burka Avenger"", a popular character from a Pakistani cartoon show, as the two go about trying to tackle the pandemic - and also the ""infodemic"", a major proliferation in fake news surrounding the coronavirus.
With more than 9.4 million infections and 137,000 deaths, India has the second highest caseload globally. A strict nationwide lockdown that was imposed on 21 March delayed the spread for a while, but infections grew rapidly - and continue to do so - since restrictions were relaxed.
A major challenge in India's fight against Covid-19 has been the false and misleading information around the pandemic, which is often shared at lightning speed.
Since the first infections were reported earlier this year, millions of people with smartphones have received hundreds of messages each about supposed cures, lockdown rumours and conspiracy theories on Covid's origins. Claims that frequently sipping warm water, shunning meat and poultry, or taking homoeopathic medicine could prevent infection have regularly landed in people's inboxes.
Fear and carelessness have seen people flouting orders to wear masks in public places or maintain social distancing. In some places, frontline workers, including doctors and nurses were attacked, even barred from their own homes by neighbours fearful of catching the virus.
""Through this campaign, we wanted to challenge misinformation, dispel fear, and support the health workers and others at the forefront of the fight against the virus,"" Ram Devineni, the Indian-American creator of the Priya comic series, told the BBC.
He launched the ""modern-day feminist superhero"" in December 2014, two years after the brutal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in Delhi, to focus attention on the problem of gender and sexual violence in India. The series has subsequently been named a ""gender equality champion"" by UN Women.
In Priya's Mask, she arrives riding the flying tigress Sahas (Hindi for courage), to battle ""an invisible monster - a deadly virus unlike any we've seen before"".
As she flies into the city, she sees masses fleeing on foot - a reminder of the early days of the lockdown in India when tens of thousands of poor migrant workers walked for days to return home while factories, offices and transport shut down.
""There's a quiet sense of fear. Everyone is hiding in their homes. It seems as though time has stopped,"" she observes.
Delhi-based writer and theatre actress Shubhra Prakash, who wrote the script of Priya's Mask, says she incorporated her personal experiences into the story.
""During the early weeks of the lockdown, we were not allowed to leave home at all. So I spent a lot of time in my balcony. My access to the world was quite restricted. We were all isolated and it was difficult for everyone. So when you see Meena, a little girl who's one of the main characters in the story, standing alone in her balcony, daydreaming, that was also me.
""And when the lockdown began to ease and we could step out, a 'new normal' emerged. We had to wear masks and maintain social distancing,"" she says.
In Priya's mask, Meena is invited to hop on to Sahas' back for a tour of the becalmed city.
They see deserted roads; Meena spots her favourite ice-cream parlour where no one is queuing up any more; she sees her friend who's as isolated as she is; and hears voices - at times irrational and fearful. At the hospital, she watches her mother, a nurse, heroically tending to Covid-19 patients.
""We wanted people to understand that these are extraordinary times. And we wanted to highlight the role of Covid heroes since we felt they were not being talked about much,"" Ms Prakash says.
""There was a lot of stigma surrounding the illness and we were trying to say that people need to be open-minded. What is keeping the world moving during the pandemic? The sacrifices made by the frontline workers, who go to work to keep us safe.""
In the comic, Priya also partners with Jiya, the Burka Avenger, who's fighting to protect her city Chutneyville against a villainous assault by Baba Kaboom, who plans to take it over by not wearing a mask and spreading the virus.
But, in the process, he himself catches Covid and needs help from Priya and Jiya.
""The most important message it conveys is we have to look at the world with compassion and not give up on humanity. We can only conquer the virus if we work together,"" Ms Prakash says.
Indrani Ray, co-producer of a two-minute animation film based on Priya's Mask (seen at the top of this story), says the pandemic has impacted everyone's life and although ""our lockdowns are different, our experiences are the same"".
Ms Ray, who lives in Mumbai, says her parents live in Kolkata and she has not been able to see them the entire year. ""I'm afraid to visit, just in case I carry the infection and pass it on to them.""
Her colleague Tanvi Gandhi says her involvement in the project was in part due to personal loss.
""I lost someone in my family to the virus, and it all happened so quickly. In a matter of four weeks, it was all over.
""That's when you realise it's not just a statistic, not a social media forward, it's something very tangible that is impacting all of us. It is as real as it can get.""
The animation is voiced by feminist icons in Bollywood and Hollywood, including Rosanna Arquette, Vidya Balan and Mrunal Thakur and 12-year-old Sairah Kabir.
The comic, which targets young people and has augmented reality features, can be downloaded for free anywhere in the world.
Mr Devineni, who lives in the US, says Priya's Mask would have relevance not just in India, but globally since the pandemic has impacted people across the world.
""New York, where I live, looked post-apocalyptic. And if you see images from European cities, many of them did too. Every time I stepped out, I could only see homeless people, it was surreal, the eeriest site I've ever seen.""
His father, a paediatrician who has practiced in South Jersey since 1975, had to stop working for the first time since he was in the vulnerable group for Covid-19.
""He's 80 and has health complications and we knew if he got it, he would have just died. In fact, two of his very close doctor friends - I had grown up calling them uncles - died from Covid. We watched their funerals on Zoom.""
Mr Devineni says when the US embassy in Delhi got in touch with him in April, asking if he'd be interested in creating a new Priya comic to launch in December for the United Nation's 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence, ""I wondered if we would be outdated by then"".
""I knew the virus would still be there and the campaign would have some resonance. Also, 10 years from now, this artwork, created during the pandemic would be a historical document, a documentation of how people dealt with it at the emotional and visceral level,"" he says, adding, ""but I think it's going to be much more than that.""
For, almost a year since the pandemic began spreading, large parts of the world are still in the grip of the virus. In Delhi, and the US, numbers continue to explode as the global infections cross 62 million, with 1.5 million dead.
And the World Health Organisation and governments in many parts of the words are still finding it a challenge to get people to wear masks or maintain social distancing. Last month, Delhi government raised the fine for not wearing masks in public from 500 rupees ($7.50; Â£5.00) to 2,000 rupees after repeated warnings fell on deaf ears.
And that, Mr Devineni says, means that Priya's Mask has more relevance than ever.

"Restoring the world’s forests on an unprecedented scale is “the best climate change solution available”, according to a new study. The researchers claim that covering 900m hectares of land – roughly the size of the continental US – with trees could store up to 205 billion tonnes of carbon, about two thirds of the carbon that humans have already put into the atmosphere. While the best solution to climate change remains leaving fossil fuels in the ground, we will still need to suck carbon dioxide (CO₂) out of the atmosphere this century if we are to keep global warming below 1.5˚C. So the idea of reforesting much of the world isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds.  Since the dawn of agriculture, humans have cut down three trillion trees – about half the trees on Earth. Already 43 countries have pledged to restore 292m hectares of degraded land to forest worldwide. That’s an area ten times the size of the UK. But what the new study advocates is reforesting something like ten times that amount. Rewilding habitats and reforesting may be easier in the future as the world is already becoming a wilder place in many areas. This may seem a strange prediction, given that the global population will grow from 7.7 billion to 10 billion by 2050, but by then nearly 70% of us will live in cities and have abandoned rural areas, making them ripe for restoration. In Europe already, 2.2m hectares of forest regrew per year between 2000-2015, and forest cover in Spain has increased from 8% of the country’s territory in 1900 to 25% today.

      Rewilding: as farmland and villages are abandoned, forests, wolves and bears are returning to Europe


 Massive reforestation isn’t a pipe dream and it can have real benefits for people. In the late 1990s, environmental deterioration in China became critical, with vast areas resembling the Dust Bowl of the American Midwest in the 1930s. Six bold programmes were introduced, targeting over 100m hectares of land for reforestation.  Grain for Green is the largest and best known of these. It reduced soil erosion and stabilised local rainfall patterns. The ongoing programme has also helped to alleviate poverty by making payments directly to farmers who set aside their land for reforestation. Better yet, the new study suggests that bringing back 900m hectares of forest wouldn’t impact on our capacity to reserve land for growing food. This is certainly possible, and in line with other estimates. Reforestation may even result in production from farmland increasing, as was found in China when more stable rainfall and fertile soil followed the return of forests. There should be more scepticism about how much CO₂ 900m hectares of new forest could store though. The paper insists on 205 billion tonnes of carbon, but this seems too high when compared to previous studies or climate models. The authors have forgotten the carbon that’s already stored in the vegetation and soil of degraded land that their new forests would replace. The amount of carbon that reforestation could lock up is the difference between the two. Mature forests can store a lot of carbon, but this capacity is only reached after hundreds of years, not a couple of decades of new forest growth as assumed in this study. The most recent estimate from the IPCC suggests that new forests could store on average an extra 57 billion tonnes of carbon by the end of the century. This is still a huge number and could absorb about one sixth of the carbon that’s already in the atmosphere, but reforestation should be thought of as one solution to climate change among many. Even if warming is stabilised at 1.5˚C, the study indicates that one fifth of the land proposed for reforestation could be rendered too hot for growing new forests by 2050. But this concern ignores the role of carbon dioxide fertilisation – when there are higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, photosynthesis is more efficient, meaning plants need less water and can still be productive at higher temperatures. Today, the most immediate threat to tropical forests is deforestation by people and the fires they light which get out of control, not the more subtle impacts of higher temperatures. Reforesting an area the size of the US will have massive benefits on local environments and will store a huge amount of man-made carbon emissions. It is not, however, a substitute for reducing those carbon emissions.  Even if the world reduces its carbon emissions to zero by 2050, there will still need to be negative global carbon emissions for the rest of the century – drawing CO₂ out of the atmosphere to stabilise global warming at 1.5˚C. Reforestation is essential for creating negative emissions – not reducing the amount of carbon that humans are still emitting. There is another sting in the tail. Massive reforestation only works if the world’s current forest cover is maintained and increasing. Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest – the world’s largest – has increased since Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, came to power. Current estimates suggest areas of rainforest the size of a football pitch are being cleared every single minute. It won’t be easy, but society needs to protect the forests we’ve got, and protect new forests in perpetuity to permanently keep carbon sequestered in trees and out of the atmosphere."

Despite what one hears from the media, the two German scientists describe recent tornado activity as being in “great doldrums”.
==========================
The Great Tornado Doldrums: No Relationship Between Climate Change and Tornadoes
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt (translated by P Gosselin)
In May 2013, there was a series of severe tornadoes that caused horrible damage. The media reported profusely on these events (see our blog article “Violent Tornado Double Strike in May 2013 in Oklahoma: The History of Tornado Alley Since 1950“). How should we perceive these storms? Has tornado activity perhaps increased over the recent years, as some commentators have assumed from their gut feeling? If yes, could climate change perhaps have something to do with it?
Rather than relying on the suspicions and interpretations from third parties, it is worthwhile to have a closer look at real data so that a scientific basis can be established for the purpose of discussion.
We therefore first take a look at the tornado frequency of the last 8 years (Fig. 1). The steepest increase in each of the curves takes place in April and May, which is the main tornado season. Surprisingly, despite the prominent storms, the year 2013 (black curve) is in last place, and is comparable only with the year 2005 (green curve), which also saw relatively few tornadoes. The years 2008 and 2011 saw the most tornadoes.

And how does this compare to the long-term? Figure 2 depicts the statistically evaluated tornado frequencies since 1954. Also here the year 2013 ranks near the bottom. More than three quarters of all years saw more tornado activity than 2013.

 Figure 2: Long-term tornado frequencies in the USA since 1954. Besides the strongest and weakest tornado years, also the limit range for the upper and lower 25%, as well as the mean value (50%) are shown. Source: NOAA Storm Prediction Center.
And how was last year? Also in 2012 tornadoes were relatively rare, as no year saw fewer tornadoes than 2012 since tornado recording began in 1954. 2012 was the absolute low-point of the officially recorded tornado development of the past 60 years. The lilac-colored curve in Figure 2 represents the year 2012, which is not that far off from the current 2013 year (black).

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Next let’s take a look at a bar chart of the last 40 years (Figure 3). Also here we can observe that tornado frequency has a downward tendency rather than an upward one.


Figure 3: Tornado frequency development since 1970 for the more powerful EF2 and higher category tornadoes (upper chart) as well as EF3 to EF5 (lower diagram). Source: WUWT.
Even though the average global temperature has risen half of a degree Celsius over the last 40 years, tornadoes have not become more frequent. Rather the contrary has occurred; they have decreased somewhat. Thus it is no wonder that the NOAA takes a clear position at its information website, and excludes climate warming as the trigger for tornadoes:
Does ‘global warming’ cause tornadoes? No. […] ‘Will climate change influence tornado occurrence?’ The best answer is: We don’t know.”
Also the Extreme Weather Report of the IPCC from 2011 is unable to find a trend in tornado development over the last decades. In the meantime this knowledge has become known to the activist groups close to the IPCC and are now no longer able to escape this reality. One of these groups is the Union of Concerned Scientists, who still claim that the main reason for climate warming is man. In a blog article dated 22 May 2013 titled “Evidence to Date Does Not Show Clear Link Between Tornadoes and Climate Change” the group writes:
The short answer is that scientists don’t see a clear link between climate change and the number or intensity of tornadoes over the past several decades.”

"The agency that runs Australia’s electricity last week gave its verdict on how to deliver what would have seemed fanciful not that long ago – a power grid that within five years should at times be able to run on 75% wind and solar energy. The Australian Energy Market Operator delivered a report on integrating renewable energy into the system with an optimistic message.  As described by its chief, New Yorker Audrey Zibelman, the technical capacity was already there, but markets and regulations would have to be adjusted. There were no “insurmountable reasons” why the grid could not take even higher levels of renewables, as it will need to for Australia to meet the Paris agreement goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The minister in charge of both energy and cutting emissions, Angus Taylor, chose a different emphasis. In a statement issued as the study was released, Taylor said it had highlighted the challenges of increased amounts of solar and wind given the system needed continuous inertia – support from constantly running “synchronous generation” – to ensure grid stability. He suggested that inertia could come from gas-fired power. The market operator’s report does not mention gas generation, but the fossil fuel – often described as having half the emissions of coal, though recent studies have suggested it could be much more – is clearly on Taylor’s mind. A few days earlier he had given interviews to Nine newspapers to support the idea of a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic, suggesting it may be a focus of future economic stimulus measures. This is not new terrain for the government. It followed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in January claiming there was “no credible transition plan” for Australia that did not involve greater use of gas, and requiring New South Wales to promise to try to substantially boost the amount of gas available as part of a $2bn energy deal. But with a climate transition plan yet to materialise, analysts and investors say Taylor’s push suggests the government may lock in long-term support for the fossil fuel without explaining what it will mean for emissions, and despite increasing evidence there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives. The outlook for gas has changed significantly since Morrison gave a speech on energy to the National Press Club three months ago. As Guardian Australia has reported, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia crashed by nearly two-thirds, prompting the industry to shelve decisions on tens of billions of dollars worth of proposed investments in export projects. Consultancy EnergyQuest has projected a 40% fall in revenue from the $50bn LNG industry, which has driven most of the increase in national emissions in recent years. While most industries have been affected by the pandemic, gas has been harder hit than renewable energy. The International Energy Agency this week reported that clean electricity was holding up through the worst global energy shock in 70 years, but demand for gas was down 5% and coal 8%. Cost plays a major part in this. Analysts at BloombergNEF found solar and wind are now the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation for at least two-thirds of the global population, Australia included. Meanwhile, Australia’s biggest oil and gas companies, Woodside Petroleum and Santos, are under siege from shareholders concerned about the financial risk of them backing long-term investments at odds with a zero emissions world. On Thursday, more than 50% of Woodside investors supported a non-binding resolution from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that the company should be setting targets to not only cut its own emissions, but those that result from the gas it sells to be burned in Asia. A similar motion at Santos’s annual general meeting won 43%. Both Woodside and Santos have resisted the push, and argued that gas is a “clean” fuel and part of the climate solution. Like Taylor, they claim Australian gas exports are an environmental good as they reduce coal in Asia. Neither the government nor industry have provided evidence to back this up, and officials have acknowledged the competition in Japan – still Australia’s biggest gas market – is increasingly with zero emissions nuclear and renewable generation. Andrew Grant, head of oil, gas and mining with London-based financial thinktank Carbon Tracker, says the global view of gas has flipped from it being seen as a cleaner fuel than coal, to it being the second-least desirable source of electricity. He points to analysis by the International Energy Agency that found global gas-fired power generation must begin to decline later this decade under a sustainable development scenario. “Better than coal is not exactly a ringing endorsement,” Grant says. The Paris deal’s implicit goal of zero emissions by mid-century has been acknowledged by Woodside and Santos’s European counterparts, particularly BP and Dutch Royal Shell. Shell, for example, has targets to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050, and to reduce the “scope 3” emissions released by customers when using its products by two-thirds by moving into clean energy. In contrast, Woodside’s chief executive, Peter Coleman, dismissed the likelihood of billion-dollar investments in renewable energy and the chairman, Richard Goyder, said the company primarily saw itself as “a gas company, with some assets in oil”. Arguments over the future of gas are complicated to some extent by the different ways in which the fuel is used. In Australia, there are three main uses – for power generation, as a feedstock and source of heat in industrial processes, and for heating and cooking by households and businesses. All have been hit by skyrocketing gas bills since an LNG export hub opened at Gladstone in Queensland mid-last decade, linking local prices to those in Asia. The government has been focused on lowering prices to help local users, mostly by pressuring states and territories to increase supply. New gas onshore fields were being proposed and considered when the pandemic hit, sending the global oil and gas prices tumbling. While the fall has offered welcome cost relief for gas users, the government has a different view to some analysts and agencies on the extent to which gas is likely to remain cost-competitive and vital to Australia’s needs. In a written response, Taylor did not answer directly a question about the role he believes gas will play as a transition fuel, or mention emissions reduction or climate change, but emphasised the “essential” role the fuel plays in energy reliability. “[It] could be even more important through a gas-fired recovery,” he said, reinforcing an earlier call for new “fast-start” generators that run only when required. But there is little evidence that the Australian electricity grid will need more gas power. Last year, it provided about 9% of generation. The market operator assessment suggested this could fall to near zero in the second half of this decade before returning in a much smaller amount – less than a third of what it is now – in the 2030s if the grid was to run at lowest cost. In terms of the flexibility in the system needed to “firm up” variable solar and wind energy, the market operator listed pumped hydro, batteries and “demand-side participation” – schemes that offer energy users incentives to scale down consumption when required – as likely sources. On gas, it said only that it may also play a greater role if prices fall. It is an option, but not the only one. Simon Holmes à Court, senior advisor to the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, says the services needed for a secure power grid are increasingly available from sources other than gas, including government-backed large batteries and potentially through adjustments at wind or additions at solar farms. Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, believes fast-start gas is likely to have a role in the power grid but says it should live or die on its own merits, and not be boosted by the government through its $1bn underwriting program for new energy projects or any other support. He is just as dismissive of suggestions the government may support new long-distance gas pipelines, which have previously been touted by Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals executive now heading the federal government’s Covid-19 Coordination Commission. It is broadly accepted gas could be replaced by cheaper electricity in heating and cooking, but is likely to have a longer role in heavy industry and manufacturing. Wood says potential replacements such as green hydrogen are not affordable today, though that could change sooner than expected not long ago, possibly within the next decade. In all its uses, he says, the role of gas is “heading in the same direction”, just on different timeframes, and it should not be the role of government to boost it. “If Angus is right, if he was an all-seeing and all-knowing god who knows gas is part of the answer, then that would be different,” Wood says. “But I don’t think he is.”"

Above: SST heat loss from Hurricane Irene
The title is sarcasm, but it does present an interesting quandary for alarmists. What’s more acceptable – hurricanes and the loss of life and property they bring, or loss of coral reef systems? My guess is that given the dislike for humankind often demonstrated by the environmental movement, they’d go for more hurricanes, and then use them to squall about “increasing extreme weather”. Fortunately, as Dr. Ryan Maue has shown us again and again, there is no upward trend in hurricane frequency.
From the AGU weekly highlights:
Preventing coral bleaching, one hurricane at a time
In recent decades, sea surface temperatures and the occurrence of heat stress in coral communities have soared. 
High surface water temperatures lead coral populations to evict their symbiotic, and colorful, algal residents. The photosynthesizing algae are what feed the coral, and the process-known as bleaching-can eventually kill it, leaving parched white exoskeletons in place of formerly vibrant reefs. However, not all coral reefs seem equally affected by mass bleaching at the hands of global warming. Some processes, like deep water upwelling, are known to offset rising temperatures locally, but Carrigan and Puotinen investigate a novel mechanism that they suggest may be responsible for protecting some susceptible populations.
Tropical cyclones (TCs) induce ocean mixing. Their strong winds whisk heat away from the sea surface, cooling surface temperatures by up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in an area typically spanning hundreds of kilometers from the eye of the storm. Though the strong waves associated with TCs are known to damage coral reefs, the extent of the cooling effect far exceeds the localized damage. Using historical TC storm tracks and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch’s records of thermal stress from 1985 to 2009, the authors analyze whether or not the cooling effect of TCs could temporarily alleviate escalating sea surface temperatures, staving off coral bleaching. At the basin scale, they find that TCs play a significant role in mitigating thermal stress for coral reefs in the North Atlantic. Further, their analysis suggests that TCs are likely important for the Great Barrier Reef, along with coral communities in western Australia, Japan, and the southwest Indian Ocean, though the spatial and temporal resolution of their model is not detailed enough to make a definitive statement. The authors note that their investigation only considered the effect of TCs on reef ecosystems that were already experiencing thermal stress. They raise the possibility that cyclones could play a preventative role, cooling the ocean waters before the corals’ heat threshold is exceeded.

"**There have been more than 1.4m confirmed cases of Coronavirus in England and more than 51,000 people have died, government figures show.**
As of 2 December London will go into tier-two restriction, after a month long England wide lockdown.
Londoners will be allowed to meet outdoors in groups of six, but households mixing indoors is still banned.
Shops, hairdressers and other forms of ""personal care"" will again open, while pubs can open if they serve substantial meals.
Below is a table of local authority areas in London showing how many people have tested positive for Coronavirus in the week leading up to 26 November and whether the number is on the rise.
The chart below shows the changing rate of confirmed Coronavirus cases across London since the start of March.
A technical glitch meant 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were originally left out of the UK daily case figures.
Over that same week the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in London jumped by 1,461 confirmed cases to more than 4,800.
The week before cases had increased by 1,488 confirmed cases.
Deaths of patients with Coronavirus in London have dropped drastically from a peak in early April.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you’re like me, some of you will recall that old favorite tune the old man used to listen to on AM radio back in the 60s and 70s: “Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days Of Summer.

Germany’s 31 gigawatt capacity wind parks have been idled by weeks of summer wind doldrums, causing spot market electricity prices to soar. Source: Philip May,  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Such wonderful summer days are pretty much what we have been having in Central Europe this month. A massive high has been delivering lots of sunshine and warm temperatures. It’s been great. But for wind park operators, this month unfortunately has been a disaster as winds have been lazy too – stuck in the doldrums for weeks now.
Spot-market prices have soared
This has led to less electricity getting pumped into the grid, and so consequently spot market prices have jumped to their highest levels since May. So reports the German media. In the end, it’s the consumer who is going to have to take over the costs associated with idled windparks.

As ‘Focus Online’ reports, referring to energy data service Point Carbon, the electricity price on the spot market (for next-day delivery) reached the highest level in 8 weeks. At 51.50 euros per megawatt hour it reached a high price that was last seen on the German exchange EEX last May.”
Last Wednesday, for example, of the 31 gigawatts of installed wind capacity, only 1 gigawatt was being delivered – a measly 3%. This level of capacity utilization has been going on now for weeks.
Making things worse, an area of clouds kept solar energy output down as well early this week, causing a considerable shortfall in German power generation.
Power generation companies, however, refuse to re-fire conventional power plants because the higher prices still are not enough to cover the costs associated with intermittent operation of conventional plants. The added shortfall only result in prices staying sky-high.
In the end it’s the consumer who has to pay. Just imagine: we’ve got all this available capacity and potential supply, yet the prices keep skyrocketing. This is what happens when complete ideology-obsessed buffoons take over the management of anything.
The latest forecast shows the lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer continuing at least another week, and with  good indications they could be lasting through much of August. Let’s hope so…though it’s not going to help the electric bill.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe recent weather in Germany indicates everything but global warming and widespread drought, which climate experts have been telling us would be the case unless we stopped burning fossil fuels fast.

Germany’s mean temperature trend continues falling sharply (1998 – 2012). 2013 so far is well below normal. (Source: Josef Kowatsch, data from German Weather Service).
Today the online Augsburger Allgemeine reports that the statistics for the 2013 German meteorological spring (March-April-May) have been 95% tabulated and show that this year’s German spring is the “coldest in in decades“. The Chiemgau24 news site reports that it is the coldest spring in 40 years.
This past weekend, snow even fell in parts of Germany at elevations down to 600 meters.
No reasons are cited as to why the spring 2013 is so cold. The Arctic is covered with ice and so it can’t be an exposed Arctic sea disrupting atmospheric patterns.

March was too cold, April was a little warmer than normal, and May will likely wind up a little colder than normal. […]
Five colder than normal winters in a row, the coldest March in decades (in the northeast in 130 years) and now the coldest spring in over 40 years…if that doesn’t lead some climate experts to run out of arguments…”
The Chiemgau24 quotes meteorologist Dominik Jung concerning models:
‘Here the long-term weather models from some international weather services had indicated a “warmer than average and sunny April and May”. But we got just the opposite. On Sunday morning it even snowed again down to 600 meters elevation,’ explained Meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal www.wetter.net.
‘Currently the mean temperature for spring 2013 (calculated from March 1 to May 25) is at 6.1°C. That’s the coldest spring in decades. It’s been more than 40 years since it’s been that cold. In 1970 the average temperature for spring was only 6.0°C,’ explains weather expert Jung.”
This might be a good time for the German Weather Service to think about dropping it’s long outdated temperature chart logo at the header of its website www.dwd.de/.

 **  
RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Hibiscus and Bays Local Board**



 **East Coast Bays Subdivision**



There are 11 candidates standing for four positions. You may cast up to four votes in this FPP election.



 **Edward Benson-Cooper –** Independent **$**



A chiropractor currently serving on the Waitemata District Health Board. It ran a deficit of nearly $15 million in 2018. 



Moving along…



 **Christina Bettany –** Backing the Bays **$$**



Has served one term. From her profile:



“I am passionate about our environment so have taken a special interest in sedimentation, recycling and waste management. I have been an active supporter of our local environmental groups in their planting and pest-free programmes as well as stream restoration initiatives.”



Sounds fine.



“I take climate change issues seriously.”



You bloody had to add that, didn’t you?



Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a climate change denier. I’m a climate change is a role for Auckland Council denier.  




 **James (Jim) Brown –** Independent **$$$$$**



Doesn’t look like he shortened his name out of frustration at people [asking if he was related to the singer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI1NfFExOSo)



“His concerns for the area include Transport and deterioration of Infrastructure. ‘Our community has outgrown its facilities and we’ve overreached our support network’. He can’t promise to fix these problems, but what he can offer is a focus on practical solutions using logic, a common-sense attitude, a willing ear and an open mind.”



That sounds just sensible enough for me to pretend I didn’t see common-sense mentioned.



 **David Cooper –** Independent **$$$$**



A current local board member. I’m curious as to why the 2016 People over Politics ticket is no more. Maybe it is the hollow ring of ‘People Before Profit’ which always results in no profit for the people.



He has a background in infrastructure engineering and strongly supports openness and transparency, having voted for the unsuccessful motion to open up local board workshops to public view.  




 **Elizabeth Hall**



Hall is concerned that everyday items are not always available locally and believes that with new apartment buildings and rest homes, the town centres need diverse well-stocked shops.  
  
Doesn’t go on to advocate Hibiscus Coast and Bays Supermarkets but she doesn’t really need to.



 **Gary Holmes –** Backing the Bays **$$**



Currently serving on the local board, Holmes has been accused of a conflict of interest for managing four Business Improvement Districts; the Glen Innes, Uptown, Dominion Road and North West business associations – through his company Campaigns Ltd.



In 2013, when six-storey apartments were proposed for Browns Bay, [Gary Holmes accused planners and councillors of using Browns Bay](http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/8362530/High-rise-plans-are-flawed-says-councillor) “like a token in their game of Monopoly where they are trying to see how many people they can squeeze into the small seaside suburb”.



However, Holmes has been only too happy to advocate for high-rises in the [BIDS that his company manages.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106665885/auckland-council-agencys-posh-apartment-plan-knocked-back)



 **Julia Parfitt –** Backing the Bays **$$$$**



Should Julia be unsuccessful in her candidacy for Albany ward, she will romp home for the local board.



 **Susana Perez –** Independent **$$$**



Perez moved to New Zealand in 1996 and has been involved in multiple charity groups including the East Coast Bays Lions. She is interested in improving road safety and the provision of adequate lighting on roads. Her interest in improving recycling is outside the proviso of the local board but appears to be standing for the first time, so I think that can be overlooked.



 **Alexis Poppelbaum –** Backing the Bays **$$$$$**



Having worked as a senior staffer to Murray McCully, Poppelbaum may well be very effective if current East Coast Bays MP Erica Stanford is a measure of the talent McCully’s former office contains. A Policy Analyst at PHARMAC and Communications Manager at the Brain Health Research Centre and experience in planning and preparing multi-million dollar budgets.  
  
Take my vote!



 **Glen Stanton –** Independent **$**



Glen is also standing for the Upper Harbour Local Board. He wants the beaches cleaned up and coastal walkways upgraded. His dream project is a World Class walkway from Browns Bay to Takapuna.  
  
Could that be a legacy project with a third-world class price tag?



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You get four votes

"As it had already been cancelled once, due to the US government shut-down last October, the latest developments in Iraq made it seem likely the Our Ocean conference, organised by the US State Department, could be cancelled again. Or that US Secretary of State John Kerry would make brief introductory remarks, and then not be seen again, as is often the case when senior government ministers attend science conferences. While he wasn’t present throughout, Kerry dominated the conference earlier this week in Washington DC. And the conviction of his speeches – given at the start and the end, and over lunch and dinner too, exhorting the world’s decision-makers not just to hear the science, but to act on it – gives rise to optimism. The focus of discussions were three of the most serious problems that threaten the ocean: over-fishing, pollution and acidification. None is an intractable problem, given sufficient national and international political will. Improve fishery regulation and traceability, don’t throw rubbish in the sea, and at least make a start on changing energy policy to reduce – and eventually halt – the ecological impact of ocean uptake of CO2. So was it a science conference at all? Not in the usual sense of researchers presenting information for discussion by fellow experts, with few others understanding more than the first couple of slides. It was made clear to those scientists invited to speak that communication was crucial: don’t assume any knowledge of the field, and construct a coherent and persuasive narrative in no more than five minutes. Only a few slides that included graphs were allowed, and they had to be  explained in less than ten words.  Three UK experts were invited to speak: Richard Thompson on marine plastic litter, along with me and Carol Turley discussing ocean acidification. Carol explained the chemistry, scale and unprecedented speed of ocean acidification; I argued the need for more data, on a worldwide basis, to improve understanding, short-term forecasting and long-term projections: what you don’t measure, you can’t manage.  The audience was made up of a very wide spectrum of decision-makers, including heads of state, ministers and other government representatives from around 80 countries, and 400 delegates from industry, charitable foundations, NGOs and UN bodies. US President Barack Obama made his contribution to the conference on video, announcing by executive decree new regulations to counteract illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in US waters, and also the establishment of what is likely to be the world’s largest Marine Protected Area in the Pacific. A flurry of announcements and commitments followed.  Leonardo diCaprio told the conference how he has always been inspired by the ocean, and pledged an extra US$7m for marine conservation projects. The President of Palau, Tommy Remengesau, announced that 80% of his country’s Exclusive Economic Zone, around 500,000km2 would become a marine sanctuary, phasing out commercial fishing. The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Børge Brende, said it was time to “stop re-arranging deckchairs on the Titanic”, and committed US$1 billion for climate change mitigation.   Proportional to population, the US equivalent spend to Norway’s would be US$68 billion. Kerry didn’t go that far, but did newly commit around US$10 million over the next three years for projects tackling ocean acidification, through NOAA and the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre in Monaco. Particular emphasis would be given to helping the development the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, in partnership with other national governments, intergovernmental bodies and The Ocean Foundation. Such support comes at a crucial time for the network, established just a year ago at an international workshop in St Andrews. Unfortunately no UK government minister attended the conference, nor were any new UK national marine initiatives announced. Sir David King, the Foreign Office special representative for climate change, did however remind the conference that four years ago the UK established the world’s largest no-take marine protected area in the waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory, as well as a major reserve in the Southern Ocean, and pointed out the challenges in enforcing fishing bans. Will the conference inspire the UK government to make more rapid progress on marine protection around Britain? According to Professor Callum Roberts, such progress is badly needed: few tangible benefits have yet been seen from Britain’s marine conservation zones. But let’s be optimistic. Sound travels faster and further in seawater than in air, so by now the good news arising from this conference should be known throughout the marine realm, with the possibility of even better news to come."

Sure enough, the do-gooders are going to start lecturing on what free school lunches should contain. I think lunches in schools programmes should involve the kids, have them prepare simple, low-cost food such as peanut butter or egg sandwiches, bake some muffins, add a piece of fruit and a glass of milk – something from all the main food groups – and thereby ensure it’s something they’ll want to eat. They can then take those ideas and skills home and into adulthood. 



But wait; I spoke too soon. Almost as soon as I typed that I came across [this news piece ](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/parent-baffled-after-child-stopped-eating-muffin-during-healthy-snack-time-christchurch-school)deeming muffins to be unhealthy.



 **… AND PATIENT RECOVERIES**



Good to see [Canterbury District Health Board pushing back ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/115458623/meat-and-milk-canterbury-hospitals-have-no-plans-to-cut-back)on the idea of removing meat and dairy from hospital meals. Protein and energy-rich food sources are not only what hungry children need, but also what those recovering in hospital, especially aged and frail,need.



 **MEATY CONTENT**



I’m sick of farmers of meat and dairy being painted as bad guys. We already have very sustainable agricultural practices in New Zealand and attitudes to stock effluent getting into waterways have completely turned around in the last few decades. We grow grass like topsy, we don’t use feedlots or intensive methods that are detrimental to the environment. 



I’m involved in programmes that support farmers and landowners to fence and plant their riparian margins and by far the majority of farmers I have come across, are passionate conservationists.



More on this topic to come. I’m watching farmers’ concerns mount especially over productive land being turned into forestry. A website to follow is 50 Shades of Green.



 **RASH SOLUTION?**



I’ve said before we hear a lot of emotive terms about such as “ _Climate Change Emergency_ ”, “ _Nuclear Free Moment”_ and others from the left, but here we are faced with a real and present danger: a measles outbreak, and the anti-vaxxers are very quiet. It’s not just anti-vaxxers, but a casual attitude towards vaccination from a generation who have never witnessed the high infant mortality rates as a result of now-preventable diseases, as well as from those who believe in pseudoscience; and I’m guessing the majority of the latter come from the left as well.



What’s not helping is red tape around some of the commonsense solutions for preventing the spread of the disease, increasing the rate of vaccination and speeding up this programme to restore herd immunity to our communities. First it’s the[ bureaucrats telling principals](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/bureaucrats-prevent-schools-from-protecting-kids-from-measles/) they can’t tell students to stay home even if they know they have measles; second, it’s pharmacists being unable to get reimbursement for vaccinations carried out their pharmacies.



 _There are 864 pharmacists around the country who are allowed to provide vaccinations for the flu, shingles, whooping cough and meningitis, but current rules mean they don’t get funded to provide the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine._



And then, there’s the lack of incentives for parents to get their children vaccinated. Surely your right to free choice over vaccinations does not give you the right to put other people in harm’s way. With that right comes responsibility; and that’s to keep your children away from school. And it doesn’t give you the right to receive government benefits including Working for Families without obligation. “ _No jab, no pay_ ”, may be controversial, but a very strong message needs to be sent to those who are dragging their feet over vaccinations or who just need a wake-up call. When David said this, the media barely covered it, but it turned out he was in very good company when Dr Lance O’Sullivan said almost exactly the same thing a day later.



 **NO JOKES PLEASE WE’RE IRISH**



Are you kidding? I’m one-quarter Irish, my mother half Irish, and we like nothing more than a good Irish joke and a knees up. We had a barney a few years back for a family reunion, shared plenty of Irish jokes and everyone dressed up as leprechauns, Irish dancers and the like. Wait…was that cultural appropriation?



Our new Race Relations Commissioner says it’s [not okay to tell Irish jokes anymore.](https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/simon-barnett-and-phil-gifford-afternoons/audio/meng-foon-it-s-not-okay-to-tell-irish-or-maori-jokes-anymore)



The biggest jokes are all these commissioners. **That’s why ACT proposes to abolish them.**
