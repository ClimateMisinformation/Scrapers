"Barack Obama will propose on Tuesday accelerating the timeline for purchasing and building new icebreakers for the US coast guard in the Arctic Ocean, as part of an effort to close an increasing gap with other countries – particularly Russia.  The White House issued the announcement late on Monday, stating that Obama will call for speeding up by two years – to 2020 from 2022 – the acquisition of a replacement heavy icebreaker. The president will also call on Congress to pass sufficient funding for the construction of additional icebreakers, which the administration said would “ensure that the United States can meet our national interests, protect and manage our natural resources, and strengthen our international, state, local, and tribal relationships”. The US has only two fully functional icebreakers in its fleet, according to a fact sheet distributed by the White House, while Russia has 40 icebreakers and an additional 11 that are planned or already under construction. Citing the melting of Arctic ice as a result of climate change, the White House said a dramatic increase was expected in sea traffic.  Alaska’s two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have both urged the construction and deployment of icebreakers and improvements in the monitoring capabilities of the coast guard in the region.  Sullivan said Obama’s decision was a “step forward”, but he also urged the president to include in his budget more funding for related activities in the region. “Today’s series of Arctic initiatives announced by the White House - especially with regards to addressing our lackluster icebreaker fleet - is a step forward. The highways of the Arctic are paved by icebreakers,” Sullivan said. “Right now the Russians have superhighways and we have dirt roads with potholes. This is the moment to become true leaders in the Arctic and I hope the administration’s words today are followed up with actions in the president’s budget priorities.” A spokesman for Murkowski said the administration’s announcement “was less a plan than an acknowledgment that these needs must be addressed, falling short of any hard commitments made”. “Senator Murkowski is fully aware of the observations shared by the administration today – being a global leader in advocating for investing responsibly in America’s Arctic future – and awaits seeing the priorities espoused today reflected in dollars in the president’s budget next year,” Murkowski’s spokesman, Matthew Felling, said in a statement to the Guardian. Obama’s announcement comes in the midst of a three-day trip to Alaska focused largely on his climate change agenda. The president is set to visit the shrinking Seward glacier on Tuesday against the backdrop of the international, State Department-sponsored GLACIER conference in Anchorage. Obama addressed the gathering on Monday, where he emphasized the need to take urgent action against climate change.  “The Arctic is at the leading edge of climate change, a leading indicator of what the entire planet faces,” Obama said. “Climate change is no longer some far-off problem. Climate change is already disrupting our agriculture and ecosystems, our water and food supplies, our energy and infrastructure.” The president also plans to trek the Alaskan wilderness with Bear Grylls, the former special forces survival expert and host of NBC’s outdoor adventure show Running Wild with Bear Grylls, in an effort to highlight conservation. Despite his ambitious trip centered on climate change, Obama has come under fire from environmental activists for his decision to allow Shell to conduct exploratory drilling in the Arctic waters. Obama defended the move in his weekly address on Saturday, insisting that his administration had made clear that the multinational oil and gas company would be held to high standards in how it carries out its operations. “Even as we accelerate this transition, our economy still has to rely on oil and gas,” he said. “As long as that’s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports.” The president was also criticized by Republicans over his decision to rename the continent’s highest peak from McKinley to Mount Denali, the original name of the mountain that translates to “the Great One” in the Athabaskan language of Alaska natives. But he was praised by all three Republicans who represent Alaska in Congress, as well as the state’s Republican governor. “I’d like to thank the president for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honor, respect, and gratitude,” Murkowski said."

"This week saw a teetering Coalition government dig in on gay marriage and climate. The government’s positions on both issues will emerge as strong ones, with time.  Labor is a pretty simple read. They are now shackled to 50% renewable energy targets regardless of economic cost and are effectively a gay marriage voting bloc, regardless of the public’s divided sentiments.  The Coalition position will come to be seen as the high ground. Same-sex marriage does divide, but the oft-quoted polls showing overwhelming support are usually telephone-based. I and other Coalition MPs have been polling our electorates, and the reality is the majority can’t be bothered responding.  Barely a quarter of the community have a strong view on marriage and that view is evenly divided. In most Coalition seats, the majority of respondents are satisfied with the status quo and, typically, are not as active on social media. Don’t forget that the half of Australia who live in Labor-held seats have MPs who, as a rule, ignore those favouring traditional marriage. That is why I am proud to be part of a party where views passionately differ, just as they do in the community. In a 1958 debate on marriage, Robert Menzies himself that declared that the issue “closely touches the individual conscience of members”, adding that “though it will be a government measure, it shall not be treated as a party measure”.  In the present day Coalition party room, nearly a third of backbenchers support a free vote on marriage in the Menzies tradition. Intriguingly, a number of them want that free vote so they can vote no – exercising their conscience rather than acting out of party compulsion. The Coalition ministry is more evenly divided, with Julie Bishop’s proposal for a plebiscite or referendum in the next parliamentary term ticking all the boxes. Australians voted for a Coalition government with a traditional marriage definition in 2013 and it should not change mid-term. Australians are plainly tired of parties saying one thing before an election then turning on a dime once elected. It’s precisely that dynamic that makes our nation’s struggle with climate policy so analogous and this week’s politics so exceptional. Prior to 2007, there wasn’t a political divide on the topic, with John Howard on board. Kevin Rudd made it a moral issue and tried to conscript Australia to a $500-per-person carbon reduction scheme while the rest of the world ignored him.  Now eight years on from Rudd’s election, Greg Hunt, the Environment Minister, has elegantly crafted the highest per capita emission cut targets in the developed world, which barely touch our GDP. By 2030, we will lose just 0.25% of economic activity. As Hunt said on Monday, Labor’s targets have 10 times the economic hit, at 2.6% of GDP each year from 2030. Labor has politicised climate like no other political party worldwide. Among the debris are two taxes, cash-for-clunkers, pink batts, the green loan disaster, outrageous solar rebates and soaring power prices. Playing the long game on climate will reap dividends for the Coalition, as we carefully balance jobs and the environment. At the next election, the two major parties offer opposing views on same-sex marriage. But there is a twist. Even if they form government, Labor’s marriage equality push will likely continue to be tied up in the Senate. That is why the Coalition’s proposal to give every Australian a say well and truly outflanks Labor, who simply won’t. It is a say that, ultimately, Australians will welcome."

"How can we say no to drilling in the Arctic when we use oil every day? We use it for heating our houses, fueling our four-wheelers and cooking our meals. But saying no to oil does not mean we have to go back to old times. When I grew up in Point Hope, 50 years ago, we used dog sleds for transportation, seal oil for warmth, whale bones and sod for shelter. All these energy sources came from our land and our ocean through the animals to us.   We were an independent sovereign culture. Fossil fuel was introduced to us. We weren’t looking for it. It changed our way of living; it made life easier, more comfortable, it afforded us luxuries - but it certainly came at a price. We have become dependent on an outside energy source; just like any other modern community in the world. Shell believes there is oil in our ocean. But extracting it comes at too big a risk for the indigenous people of the Arctic. The Inupiaq culture is centered around the harvest of marine mammals. We are who we are because the animals give themselves to us on their yearly migration.  We exist because they feed us with their body and their spirit. We don’t hunt for fun or for trophies, we hunt to subsist, to sustain what is left of our sovereign way of life. An oil spill will destroy the Arctic and it will destroy our subsistence way of life. The US government predicts a 75% chance of an oil spill happening. Even in the small likelihood there is no spill, the drilling itself will disturb our animals. Shell itself estimates in its last environmental permit application that drilling activity will harass 13% of endangered species like bowhead whale, grey whale and ringed seals.  Using the oil locked in the Arctic Ocean will accelerate climate change. Climate change is already here for us. The ice has changed. It comes late, it leaves early. It has become unreliable and hard to read, making it dangerous to cross during hunting. Our ice cellars are melting and eroding, making it difficult to store our subsistence food. It rained this past winter, it never rains in the winter. The ice in the fall used to protect our coastline from heavy waves. Now the waves wash away our shores. To keep climate change from destroying the Arctic any further, Arctic Ocean oil needs to stay in the ground. According to a recent study funded by the UK Energy Research Centre a third of the oil reserves should remain in the ground and not be used before 2050 if global warming is to stay below 2C (3.6F). A temperature rise limit set for this century that will hopefully prevent catastrophic climate change. There is energy in the Arctic other than oil. Solar and wind power is available for everyone here. What we need is the affordable technology to develop and store these natural unlimited energy sources. There certainly is enough room for wind farms and solar farms. We can make a different choice now – just look at Hawaii’s recent commitment to become completely fossil fuel independent by 2045. “Alarm Bells are ringing”, says president Obama about climate change in an infomercial announcing his visit to the Arctic. Here in the Arctic, those sirens have been sounding for decades. Shell is drilling in our ocean, threatening our way of life with its noise and probable oil spills. Climate change is happening in the Arctic, with the Arctic ice pack melting faster than ever. The rest of the world is in the same boat, they just don’t know it yet.  President Obama, time changed and it will change again. It is now that we have to make the transition to new energy sources for the world. Moving away from oil is not going back into time, it is moving forward. There will be a time that talking about fossil-fueled car will sound as old as dog sled transportation sounds now. For the sake of the Inupiaq and for the sake of the earth, leave the oil in the Arctic and put the government’s money and energy into perfecting the technology to unlock natural renewable energy sources that are available to everyone. We need energy sources that can be used locally and that will give us back our independence - and we need it now. "
"Climate change is worsening the fires that ravage many parts of America each year. Grime-streaked firefighters battling one of the 167 active wildfires currently scorching portions of the US west will tell you as much. What they have encountered on the firelines in the past few years is evidence that everything has changed as a result of global warming. In mid-August, the day after a quick-moving fire first exploded southwest of Boise, Idaho, the blaze more than doubled in size to nearly 79,000 acres in one four hour stretch. Along the way, it sparked a “firenado” that rained hot ash and dirt on firefighters. Or consider the disturbing talk surrounding the still-smoldering fire named Rocky that this month scorched 70,000 acres near Napa, California: “This fire wants to do whatever it wants,” Jason Shanley, a Cal Fire spokesman, observed, adding “It’s defying all odds. 30 year, 40 year veterans have never seen this before.” Last year, a raging wild land fire blasted into Yosemite National Park, propelled by a self-generated micro-climate that intensified its unpredictability. Even the idea that there is a definitive fire season has gone up in smoke. The calendar doesn’t matter when flames scoot across a Colorado snowfield in December, as happened in 2012, or blacken foothills in Southern California’s rainy months.  But what firefighters believe is abnormal is just a new normal driven by climate change. Temperatures that spike above long-held norms, record-breaking low-humidity levels, multi-year droughts, tinder-dry vegetation and fierce winds are among the factors fueling these new, more massive infernos. The sooner that firefighting agencies, public officials, policymakers and citizens acknowledge the impact that climate change is having on the frequency, intensity, duration and behavior of fire, the sooner that they will begin to develop new responses to wildland fire in the US west. Doing so will mean admitting that climate change is also disrupting the capacity of firefighting organizations to respond. They were created to snuff out fires based on what were perceived to be static weather patterns – the old normal. Today’s powerful conflagrations have also exposed the conceit that we must fight all fires, everywhere. That commitment is made doubly dangerous given how dried out the US west has become due to the mega-drought that has been wracking the region since 2010.  Factoring climate change into our calculations about what fires we’re able and not able to fight will be a hard concession for firefighters and the public to accept. Still, we will have to let some fires burn, particularly those distant from populated areas. Yet making such tough choices must come coupled with an increase in spending at national, state and local levels for fire-prevention measures. The US Forest Service is now spending more than 50% of its budget on firefighting alone, which is seriously undercutting its ability to conduct more cost-effective thinning of forests that can diminish a fire’s intensity and speed. More money is also needed for educational outreach to those inhabiting fire zones – dubbed the wildland-urban interface – to ensure that their dwellings are more fire safe and defensible. This investment is particularly imperative in California, where more than two million people live in these zones, putting themselves directly in the path this new fire regime. The extreme situations wildland firefighters now regularly encounter are warning signs. How bad it gets depends on how quickly we can read and respond to them."

"I’ve been interested in the way the migrant crisis is being debated in politics and the media. It’s that word – crisis – that is particularly striking. It suggests that what we’re seeing in across Europe is an aberration, a temporary disaster to be “solved” by politicians. Even the sight of ramshackle tents in Calais suggests a phenomenon that could be cleared away at any given moment. In The Concept of the Political, the philosopher Carl Schmitt argued that, when presented with crisis, liberal democracies will put aside constitutional niceties in order to survive. The public consents to its government violating liberal values because crisis is a state of exception, which requires desperate measures.  Perhaps that explains why there has been so little uproar over supposedly civilised societies using terminology like “marauding” and “swarms”, and making policy decisions that result in hundreds of people drowning in the Mediterranean or languishing in detention centres. These things, we think, don’t reflect who we are as people. They are just necessary responses to this current crisis. There is only one problem with calling this phenomenon of migration a crisis, and that is that it’s not temporary: it’s permanent. Thanks to global climate change, mass migration could be the new normal. There are lots of estimates as to what we can expect to see in the near future, but the best known (and controversial) figure comes from Professor Norman Myers, who argues that climate change could cause 200 million people to be displaced by 2050. In fact, it’s already happening. According to the Pentagon, climate change is a “threat multiplier” and does appear to be increasing risk of conflict. Indeed a new study released in March suggests this is exactly what happened in Syria, after a severe drought in 2006. As the study’s co-author, Professor Richard Seager, explains, “We’re not saying drought caused the [Syrian conflict]. We’re saying that added to all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the threshold into open conflict. And a drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human-driven drying of that region.” Syria now has the highest number of refugees in the world. A new government-commissioned report on the looming climate-induced food shortage suggests that “the rise of Isis may owe much to the food crises that spawned the Arab spring”. In his book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond points out that the most environmentally stressed places in the world are the most likely to have conflicts, which then generate refugees. Rapid climate change will environmentally stress lots of developing countries. But it’s not just conflicts exacerbated by climate that will create refugees: climate change, in and of itself, is likely to cause mass migration. As Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London puts it: “Climate and vegetation zones are shifting, so the Mediterranean will likely keep getting drier this century, with knock-on negative social and economic impacts. That will be tough for Spain, Italy and Greece, where significant numbers of people may move north, and of course, displaced people from elsewhere wouldn’t stay in the Mediterranean, they’d keep travelling north.” In other words, the Mediterranean countries currently trying to cope with migrants from other parts of the world may eventually have a migrant crisis of their own. One day there could conceivably be Italians and Greeks in camps in Calais, as their own countries become even hotter and more arid. In a 2014 paper, Migration as Adaptation, Kayly Ober suggests migration is a good way of dealing with the imminent effects of climate change. She argues that the international community’s thoughts should “turn from not only stemming greenhouse gas emissions, but also how to deal with an already altered world”. The idea of millions of migrants being assisted to move to western Europe might scandalise the Daily Mail, but it shouldn’t – because migration might be a form of adaptation many Britons may also have to consider. According to the Environment Agency, 7,000 British properties may be lost to rising sea levels over the next century. These people too will need to be relocated. So what do we do about climate migration? The first step is to change our perceptions. We need to process the fact that migration isn’t going to go away or be “solved”. In all likelihood, it will become more common; a new normal. The second step is obvious – we must all be more active in pushing governments to take more decisive action to reduce global greenhouse emissions, so that more people can remain safely in their homes and communities. For its part, Britain must adhere to international commitments to reduce emissions in line with keeping warming below dangerous levels (in other words 2C above pre-industrial levels) as well as providing adequate funds for adaptation. Britain must also push for a strong equitable global deal in the Paris climate talks in December, seen by many as the “last chance” to avert catastrophic climate change. And finally, we need to urgently address the current strategies western governments are using to deal with migration, and the almost rabid commentary that often accompanies those strategies. There is a strong case for Britain to take a substantial number of climate refugees: as the first country to industrialise, we need to take historical responsibility for climate change, and should take into account our historical carbon emissions and their effects when responding to mass climate migration. The migration we are witnessing is not a state of exception: it is the beginning of a new paradigm – and how we choose to respond to it reflects on who we fundamentally are as a society. We must deal with the victims of this permanent crisis in a compassionate way, not just for their humanity but for our own."
"For the first time, Hillary Clinton has openly criticised President Obama in her bid to win the Democrat nomination. In a tweet last night , she condemned the president’s decision to licence Arctic drilling that was he signed off earlier this week. “The Arctic is a unique treasure,” she said. “Given what we know, it’s not worth the risk of drilling.” Her criticism has been echoed around the world. Lobbyists globally are trying to work out why the man who has so clearly identified climate change as a legacy issue, and who in the past year has done so much to promote the green agenda, has taken such a controversial, counterintuitive step. Back in May, when his decision was first indicated, the president justified it by arguing that it would be impossible to abandon fossil fuels until the transition to clean energy sources was finally accomplished. He said it would be better if the US, with its high safety standards, exploited all its available reserves, rather than importing oil from what he implied was any old foreigner. A few days later, he too took to Twitter to justify his actions, pointing out that Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant which has already spent more than $6bn on the project of winning permission to drill, had been sent back to the drawing board and forced to redesign safety aspects of its plan. Supporters pointed out that the permissions had originally been granted under President George W Bush, and halting them, for example by a moratorium on the entire coastal shelf, as another Democrat candidate Bernie Sanders demanded, or by buying out the permissions, would require formidable amounts of compensation and would be likely to face a legal challenge. And, they say, it is only a permit to explore, not yet a contract for commercial exploitation. If the anticipated reserves are present, those contracts would be a matter for the next administration.  But his green critics, so recently heralding him as one of their own, are mystified and unimpressed. Only last February he vetoed a mischief-making Republican bill to allow oil from Canadian tar sands to be imported down the Keystone XL oil pipeline on the grounds that the US did not need more oil; now he is justifying giving the go-ahead to Shell – a European multinational, the greens point out – in the name of energy self-sufficiency. This all feels familiar to observers of the British scene. Earlier this week, in the name of the search for energy security, more than 1,000 square miles of countryside was opened up for fracking applications. The decision comes hot on the heels of proposed changes to planning laws that will force councils to decide all relevant applications within 16 weeks, with the government waiting to step in and impose a decision, and after environmental campaigners complained that in the government’s first three months 10 different environmental policies had been watered down or scrapped altogether. Among them were support for renewable energy technology and the privatisation of one of the few flagship successes of the last parliament, the Green Investment Bank. This is depressing evidence of a reluctance to tackle the biggest challenge of keeping the increase in global temperatures below two degrees. Since March, the Guardian has been campaigning to persuade investors that ultimately the majority of known fossil fuel reserves will have to be left in the ground. That requires a revolution not just in thinking now, but in the way we understand economic development. It can no longer be a question of exploitation of resources. Now sustainable economies must be built on a deliberate exercise in forgoing them. Every time a new area of fossil fuel exploitation is opened up, even if it is shale gas which appears less polluting than coal or oil, the risk is that the transition drifts a little further downstream. The Obama decision on Arctic drilling on the face of it is wrong because it jeopardises a unique environment. But it is even worse than that. It is another barrier to a change on which a sustainable future depends."
"A major global insurer has warned of the “grave reputational risks” of bankrolling Adani’s huge Queensland coal project, as the vulnerable island nation of Kiribati has begun a diplomatic campaign to halt new coalmines worldwide. The investment arm of UK-based Aviva, which manages assets worth $522bn, is the latest international financier to flag concerns over the Carmichael coalmine, which it said could become a “stranded asset” and was “the antithesis of what was needed” ahead of key UN climate talks in Paris in December.  Aviva Investors’ head of responsible investment engagement, Abigail Herron, said the asset manager had recently “sought assurances” from Standard Chartered, the UK bank which subsequently withdrew from its advisory role to Adani over the project. “The reputational risks inherent in the Carmichael project are grave and many of the major financiers rightly recognise this and have stepped away from the project,” Herron said. Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, which faces acute climate risks through rising seas, has written to state leaders calling for an immediate worldwide moratorium on new coalmines and expansions ahead of the Paris climate talks. “Kiribati, as a nation faced with a very uncertain future, is calling for a global moratorium on new coalmines,” Tong wrote in a letter to other national leaders.  “It would be one positive step towards our collective global action against climate change and it is my sincere hope that you and your people would add your positive support in this endeavour. Tong wrote that stopping new coalmines would make any agreement in Paris “truly historical”, while the “construction of each new coalmine undermines the spirit and intent of any agreement we may reach”. “As leaders, we have a moral obligation to ensure that the future of our children, our grandchildren and their children is safe and secure. For their sake, I urge you to support this call for a moratorium on new coalmines and coalmine expansions.” Both the Australian and Queensland state governments publicly support the Carmichael coal project, which would generate carbon emissions equivalent to 1.3 times Australia’s total annual output from burned coal. The federal court last week overturned approval of Adani’s mining licence by the environment minister, Greg Hunt, who could not show he fully took into account advice on vulnerable snake and skink species impacted by the mine. This prompted an attack on Wednesday from trade minister Andrew Robb on conservationists he said were using “a skink” for “a patsy” in obstructionist legal challenges that were undermining trade talks with India. Conservation groups responded on Thursday by announcing a major newspaper advertising campaign targeting Hunt over his handling of the mine. The ads, which will appear on Friday, will pose the question: “Is Greg Hunt the minister for the environment, or the minister against the environment?” Australian Conservation Foundation president Geoff Cousins said Hunt’s renewed deliberations on Adani’s application under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act would be “a major test for [him] as minister for the environment”. “Adani’s Carmichael mine would be the biggest coalmine in Australia,” Cousins said. “If it goes ahead it will destroy wildlife habitat, damage scarce outback groundwater and contribute to the world’s climate problem when the coal is burned.” Aviva’s Herron said if the project goes ahead, it “could have significant negative local and global environmental and human rights impacts”.  “The Carmichael project also has the potential to become a stranded asset and is the antithesis of what is needed as policymakers gear up to negotiating a credible longterm greenhouse gas reduction at the upcoming negotiations in Paris,” she said. “We have recently spoken with Standard Chartered to seek assurances about their involvement in the project and take great comfort from the announcement that they will be withdrawing from their advisory role with Adani.” She said this was in line with the bank’s policy against financing clients who “have impact upon and operations located within Unesco world heritage sites”. The coal project’s impact on the world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef – through port expansion, increased shipping and climate impact through emissions from coal – was “a very pertinent issue to us”, Herron said. Standard Chartered announced on Monday it was withdrawing from the project, with an Adani spokesman later saying the bank had done so at the company’s direction. It followed Commonwealth Bank last week also confirming it would end its advisory role over the project, which Adani again said was initiated by the miner. Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Nikola Casule said Aviva’s warning was “yet another sign of how unviable this destructive coal project has become”.  “With climate change being a real concern for financial institutions worldwide, more and more investors are now seeing this mega coalmine for what it really is: a threat to the climate and the Great Barrier Reef,” he said. “With banks walking away and investors clearly voicing their concerns, the Australian federal government must not provide any taxpayer subsidy or support to prop up this controversial project.” There has been speculation that aborted Queensland government funding for Adani’s mine infrastructure could be replaced by the federal government’s new proposed development fund for northern Australia. Further comment was sought from Adani, which has previously stated that it initiated the end to the advisory roles of both banks as it focused on obtaining government approvals which it claimed had delayed the project. Adani has put virtually all other work towards the mine on hold, axing its engineering contractors, project management teams and reportedly putting its inhouse engineers on notice. An Adani spokesman said the company “together with local businesses in the communities in which we live and work, and trusted suppliers, is committed to delivering jobs and economic benefits in Queensland”.  “Together with other miners and our industry body, we’ll continue to make clear the destructive impact on local communities of politically motivated activists seeking to deny these jobs and economic benefits through their endless use of legal loopholes,” he said. Adani’s own modelling, as revealed in a separate Queensland land court challenge, suggests the project is viable at a Newcastle benchmark thermal coal price of $80-$100, according to energy analyst Tim Buckley. That price currently sits at around $60. The separate steep fall in world prices for coking coal forced New Zealand’s largest coalminer, Solid Energy, into bankruptcy, it was also reported on Thursday."

"Build an imaginary world in your mind, hanging in space. Spin it around a bit; kick the tires. Now change one thing about that world. Throw a bug of your choice into the machine. What if the oceans reclaim your coastal cities? What if you can’t support life? What if the life you bear can’t support you? Ponder the answer, and you’ll create what the critic Robert Scholes has called “radical discontinuity,” the cognitive dissonance that allows science fiction to explore the most pressing concerns of its age. For our age – the Anthropocene, the proposed geologic epoch defined by human impact – the discontinuities are clear. The question is not if we will change the planet but when, and how existing changes will render it unrecognizable.  The stories we tell ourselves can help us understand, and maybe even adapt, to this new world. But the dour dystopias and escapist fantasies of our current science fiction diet just won’t do. We need something new: a form of science fiction that tackles the radical changes of our pressing and strange reality. We need an Anthropocene fiction. The mechanics of science fiction function at every level, from granular observations of everyday life to speculations on the cosmos, all while maintaining the human thread; it may be the only genre capable of such monumental shifts in scale. And the Anthropocene requires scale: a geologic period with no end in sight, it will affect our lives and those of our distant descendants. It can be difficult to conceive of something so enormous through facts alone. But the right fiction can be a mirror, a map and a crystal ball, helping us to see ourselves in the world, negotiate our way out of disaster and imagine how we might live differently. When today’s sci-fi blockbusters address ecological issues, they tend toward the dystopian. Mad Max: Fury Road is an unflinching portrait of the world after water; the frozen tundra of Snowpiercer is the consequence of a failed climate-control experiment; even Godzilla rises from a warming sea. But purely apocalyptic stories don’t help us reckon with reality’s slower, but equally devastating, emergencies – forests that vanish acre by acre, sea levels that rise a few millimeters each year, demand for consumer goods that gradually leeches the planet’s resources. Sci-fi has always mirrored the time of its writing. The themes of Star Trek – race relations, Cold War fears, American imperialism – were rooted in the politics of the 1960s. And when the modern environmental movement began in the early 1970s, a generation of sci-fi writers authored its myths. Some were hopeful. In Ernest Callenbach’s seminal 1975 novel Ecotopia, the Pacific Northwest runs happily on green energy and liberal cannabis use. Others issued warnings. In Harry Harrison’s Make Room! Make Room! – adapted into the film Soylent Green – the global population is sardined in overcrowded cities, living hand-to-mouth on scarce resources. Such myths formed the poles of the movement’s worldview, expressing its highest ideals and deepest fears. In recent years the term climate fiction, or cli-fi, has emerged to refer to works dealing explicitly with climate change. Margaret Atwood has championed the term, which has since been applied broadly, and even retroactively, to writers like JG Ballard and Jules Verne. Cli-fi, with an emphasis on global warming and its attendant anxieties, goes some of the way toward the ideal of Anthropocene fiction, but it’s too narrow a designation. Even the books most often cited as examples of cli-fi – Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy, Paolo Bacigalupi’s Windup Girl, Atwood’s Oryx and Crake – address issues beyond climate change. They envision futures dictated by human recklessness: as Atwood said this year in an interview with Slate, it’s not climate change; it’s “the everything change.” The Anthropocene is everything change. Our impact on this planet began with agriculture, and it will take many forms before our reign ends, whether by emigration or disaster. As any science fiction writer knows, the future is full of strangeness: could artificial intelligence have an ecological impact? What are the toxicological effect of nanoparticles? And when we upload our minds to computer servers – or leave earth to journey further afield in space – will we take the Anthropocene with us? In his book Molecular Red, the critical theorist McKenzie Wark writes that science fiction can be read as a form of theory, a “realism of the possible,” helping us think through the world as it is and as it may be. By virtue of its geologic timespan, global impact and sheer complexity, the Anthropocene suggests scenarios transcending basic dystopia or simple narrative. Science fiction for this epoch should address not just heat waves and tsunamis but the ends of civilization, memory and archives as well as the immense global negotiations and networks that human survival will require. The point is that Anthropocene fiction isn’t just science fiction; nor is it just climate fiction. It’s both those things and more. It is all the stories we should tell our children: near-future tales of ecological systems, collapse, responsibility and possibility along with visions of long-term cohabitation with our own environment. The point is to show them not just how the story ends but how we might get through the middle – while we still have a shot at changing it."

"Business leaders have said Tony Abbott has no detailed policies to meet his new climate change target and fear the uncertainty of the current “blank sheet of paper” on greenhouse policy could harm the economy and push up power prices. The prime minister is arguing he can achieve the target to cut Australia’s emissions by 26% by 2030 more cheaply than Labor, even though neither major party has outlined a detailed or costed climate policy.   Abbott said he would continue to allocate $200m a year to buying greenhouse abatement with his emissions reduction fund, but this is likely to account for less than a quarter of the new target and the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Wednesday the spending was “capped”. Another quarter is likely to come from the so-called “safeguards mechanism” – which is supposed to impose limits on industrial emissions and could – if stringent – become an emissions trading scheme where businesses buy and sell permits. Matthew Warren, the chief executive of the Energy Supply Association of Australia, said: “It is not possible to meet this target with the government’s emissions reduction fund or the safeguards mechanism as it stands.” “It is not credible to think we can just keep buying emissions through the emissions reduction fund to meet this kind of target.” Warren said: “We really need a clear and substantial policy from each major party to either price carbon or else regulate carbon emissions ... It might be possible if the Coalition’s safeguards mechanism becomes, in effect, a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme. That will impose a cost on industry and it has to mean costs to consumers. These conclusions are inescapable and we desperately need to start talking about what policy we will use to make this change, because this is major economic reform we are talking about.” Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said it was “impossible to compare the costs of the major parties’ climate policies because neither has told us how they would achieve a target”. “Trying to cost what they have on the table is really just grasping at straws. We need to start filling in the detail ... the Coalition could ramp up the safeguards mechanism, but that obviously has costs and consequences for businesses and for consumers.” The Ai Group said achieving the new target using only the emissions reduction fund would cost between $100bn and $250bn. “We prefer a market-based mechanism designed to be least-cost and not to damage trade-exposed industry,” Willox said. According to Warren: “the only good thing to say about the scorched earth of Australia’s climate policy debate in recent years is that we are at least starting with a blank sheet of paper.” “The current uncertainty will itself drive up prices. Banks have put away their cheque books on energy projects. Policy uncertainty has rendered electricity generation projects unbankable. That cost has been masked because lower demand has meant we haven’t needed new projects but when new assets are needed, that risk premium will be there and it will push up electricity prices.” The warnings were born out in the government’s own economic modelling, which found that the impact of business uncertainty on the cost of Australia’s climate action had an even bigger impact on the Australian economy than other countries’ climate action. It found that “the negative impact of policy uncertainty” to Australia’s GDP is about three times larger ... than the impact of all international action because “higher perceived risk reduces investment in the energy sector” which increases energy prices and business input costs. Uncertainty, it said, had “a very large impact on investment” and “on real GDP” and significant consequences for investment. Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, responded to the new policy by saying she “looked forward to engaging with the government on the development of workable policies to achieve Australia’s post-2020 target”. The government has said it will unveil new energy efficiency measures, including for cars, new policies on ozone and HFC gases and is counting on “technology improvements”, for example battery storage, to deliver additional emission reductions. Some extra detail about the safeguards mechanism will be decided by November."

"Behind the Abbott government’s very bad week – a careening series of disasters that looked like the political version of an AAMI ad – is a common thread that could wreck it permanently. Tricky politics has driven Tony Abbott into yet another crisis. So many of the prime minister’s problems begin in the strange netherworld of decision making, where policy is crafted to fit a slogan rather than the other way around, based on the insulting assumption that voters are too dumb to notice.   All politicians, from all sides, weigh policy ideas against how they might play in the electorate but this government is coming up with the slogan and calculating the political “play” before it even has a policy. It’s a reckless way to run the country. Now the trickiness is sometimes aimed at internal opponents as well as Labor.  Same-sex marriage, for example, was going to be a difficult issue for any Coalition leader. In the end the party backed Abbott’s view that it should continue to oppose any change to the definition of marriage during this parliament but that this position wouldn’t be tenable any longer and that maybe there should be a popular vote on the issue.  But now supporters of same-sex marriage see Abbott and other opponents of the idea taking the confused party-room non-decision about what should happen after the next election and crab walking it towards a process that will ensure nothing ever happens. Abbott has the slogan all ready – he’s for a “people’s vote” and the Labor party is for a “politicians’ vote”. He just didn’t have a policy. Malcolm Turnbull and others say the party room did not in fact make a definite decision in favour of a “people’s vote” at all and there is obviously no decision on what kind of people’s vote. Some are opposed to a change, like Scott Morrison (who is apparently positioning as the conservative’s preferred alternative leadership candidate), are talking up the idea of a constitutional referendum which would ensure change never happened, and isn’t even necessary because we already know the federal government has the power to make laws about marriage, as the attorney general very pointedly pointed out to his cabinet colleague on national television. The ministerial slugfest via TV grabs continued through Friday in a kind of real-time display of government divisions. Perhaps if the cabinet had been consulted before the surprise party-room meeting and had come up with a strategy things would have turned out differently. But there are a lot of same-sex marriage supporters in cabinet, so that might have got in the way of the tricky.  The “people’s vote versus politician’s vote” slogan strategy was designed to “neutralise” the issue, but in fact has ensured it will continue to be an issue right through the next poll. Tricky has quickly turned into a political car crash. The Coalition’s new climate change targets may yet turn into another example. They aren’t enough to meet Australia’s share of limiting global warming to 2C and they are behind many developed nations but they aren’t as low as some of the government’s previous decisions on climate policy might have led us to anticipate.  This, we are informed by numerous commentators, is so the government can run the slogan that it will protect the environment without wrecking the economy (like Labor will). But there is, as yet, almost no detail about how the government intends to meet the target and therefore no way to measure the economic cost of either plan. The government got around this by the Daily Telegraph suddenly unearthing three-year old modelling of targets it asserted were Labor’s. When there are actual costings of alternative policies the cost may not be all that different. And, in any event, polls show voters are willing to wear some cost increases, and don’t trust the Coalition’s bona fides. More tricky-gone-wrong came with the revelations about the royal commission into trade union corruption. It was designed with two main objectives in mind – to examine deeply concerning allegations concerning some trade unions and to mortally wound the one-time union leader Bill Shorten. The former could have been achieved with the judicial inquiry the Coalition promised during the election campaign, or by using existing processes, such as the courts. But the latter was obviously much better served by the gravitas of a royal commission. It was reported at the time that the Coalition was so enthusiastic in pursuing its political goals that the terms of reference had to be corrected in cabinet because as originally drafted they would have actually set up a royal commission into the Labor party rather than the labour movement. It was this real suspicion of political motivation that lent lethal credibility to the revelation that the royal commissioner Dyson Heydon had agreed to speak at a Liberal party fundraiser – a fact that will be used to try to shut down the hearings, sully the commission’s findings and certainly blunt its usefulness as a tricky political manoeuvre. And this week came after many other examples of backfiring trickery – like the attempt to head off cabinet discontent over unconstitutional and unworkable citizenship laws (that had been flagged for a year in the media but never presented in detail to the cabinet) by getting backbenchers to write a letter asking that they go further. Almost every constitutional lawyer in the country has now lined up to say the bill is, indeed, likely to be unconstitutional and may even lead to the stripping of the citizenship of scores of folk convicted in the past of damaging commonwealth property. It is unclear how the government intends to handle this.  At the same time the government’s policy agenda is thin and confused, its days filled with ad hoc announceables, and protestations about jobs and growth and ill-defined stories about intentions to get even tougher on national security than its already extremely tough stance.  Voters had already lost trust in the prime minister, dating back to his first ill-considered budget. His colleagues’ faith got pretty shaky earlier this year as well. They are now once again expressing despair. As the divisions deepen and the polls get worse, the Coalition is again descending into a self-defeating cycle of instability, suspicions and second guessing of the leadership intentions of Turnbull or Morrison or Julie Bishop.  Some argue the government just needs a clear narrative to sell its policies. But that would require the trickiness to be set aside long enough to figure out what they are."

"Fifteen state attorneys general petitioned a federal court in Washington on Thursday to block new US rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants, in the first of several expected legal challenges to the Obama administration measure.  States that oppose the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) clean power plan filed for the stay in the US court of appeals for the DC circuit. The states asked for a ruling by 8 September, one year before they need to submit compliance plans to the EPA.   “This rule is the most far-reaching energy regulation in the nation’s history, and the EPA simply does not have the legal authority to carry it out,” West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey said.  The Obama administration unveiled the final version of the clean power plan on 3 August. It aims to lower emissions from the country’s power plants by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.  President Barack Obama called the rule the biggest action the US had taken to date to address climate change.  Under the proposal, each state needs to submit a plan to the EPA detailing how it intends to meet the target the agency set for it.  States, particularly those that have relied on coal for electricity, have argued the EPA has overstepped its regulatory authority.  “The Clean Air Act was never intended to be used to create this type of regulatory regime, and it flies in the face of the powers granted to states under the US constitution,” said Morrisey.  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming joined West Virginia in requesting the stay.  The EPA said the Clean Power Plan would withstand legal challenges because it was based on a “sound legal and technical foundation”.  “To ensure that the Clean Power Plan’s significant health benefits and progress against climate change are delivered to all Americans, EPA and the Department of Justice will vigorously defend it in court,” EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia said.  Attorneys general for 15 other states, including New York, California, Illinois and Oregon, along with New York City and the District of Columbia, issued a statement supporting the EPA rules and saying they would oppose legal efforts to block their implementation.  The EPA has not yet filed the rule in the Federal Register, at which point parties can begin to formally file lawsuits. "

"What kind of impulses might rush through climate scientists’ minds as they scroll through some of the gumph that gets written on climate change? Perhaps partaking of a violent act at the expense of a computer monitor after reading how they’re only carrying on this atmospheric physics hoax to maintain the gargantuan salaries that they don’t get?  Maybe that line that we’re “heading for an ice age” might cause an outbreak of involuntary smashing of heads into desks? Global warming is a hoax because it’s cold outside? Pass them a rusty teaspoon so they can gouge their eyes out. Anyway, like I say. I’ve no idea.  But one growing community of scientists has a new tool at their disposal to assess the credibility of climate change stories and commentary online. And it’s not a rusty teaspoon. Using the Climate Feedback tool, scientists have started to diligently add detailed annotations to online content and have those notes appear alongside the story as it originally appeared.  If you’re the writer, then it’s a bit like getting your homework handed back to you with the margins littered with corrections and red pen. Or smiley faces and gold stars if you’ve been good. The scientists also give each story a grade for its “scientific credibility”.  Articles appearing on CNN, The Telegraph (UK), The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have already been through the Climate Feedback ringer (they even had a crack at the Pope’s recent encyclical on climate change). Some stories have come out with solid endorsements. Others, not so much. The scientists looked at a recent story in the UK’s Daily Telegraph under the headline “Earth heading for ‘mini ice-age’ within fifteen years”.  Six climate scientists have analyzed the article and they estimate its overall scientific credibility to be ‘low’ to ‘very low’. Ooof. Frowny face. So far about 40 scientists have joined the Climate Feedback group from places like MIT, the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Harvard, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and universities in the UK, Australia and the US. The project is the brainchild of climate scientist Dr Emmanuel Vincent, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of California. He told me: As a climate scientist, one of my personal motivations is the frustration I have when I read some news on climate that I know are inconsistent with science and I have no efficient way of sharing this knowledge. I wanted to develop an effective and scalable way for scientists to share what they know with readers and journalists. Also, many of my friends or colleagues –who do not have expertise in climate– are often genuinely confused by contradictory stories on climate change, for instance when one outlet says polar ice is melting and another says it isn’t. If my friends are confused, I’m sure there are plenty of others who could benefit from a thorough analysis by those knowledgeable on the topic. Vincent says the idea came from conversations with Dan Whaley, the founder of an online platform called Hypothesis - the same tool scientists are using to annotate the online text. So far Vincent says they’ve looked at high-profile media sites that have large digital audiences.  We stick to pieces that claim to be based on scientific evidence. We receive recommendations from our scientific community; ideally journalists will become involved in the selection process as well.  We encourage scientists to stay close to their field of expertise and cite relevant sources when the subject is not their direct domain of expertise. Note that a large part of climate coverage is on broad subjects and a PhD in climate science often allows you to be expert enough on the matter. If a scientist is making authoritative comments on a field he has no expertise in, other scientists can reply to his comment. Vincent says the scientists volunteer their time to review articles and thinks they take part because of a “moral and professional duty” to speak up when “some media are distorting important topics”. So has the Climate Feedback site had any feedback itself from the writers they have reviewed? Not much, but there has been some. The main exchange we got was with Bjorn Lomborg who replied to the scientists’ analysis of an op-ed he wrote for the Wall Street Journal in an article published in Forbes. In his reply, Lomborg did not address the bulk of the criticism that was made about his article: his conclusion that “most of the data on climate is actually encouraging” is unsupported by science and by his own argumentation. So far there has been no editing of the scientific comments but Vincent says they’re thinking about bringing some editors on board.  But will it make a difference?  We want to encourage higher standards of excellence in science reporting. We know that journalists face a credibility crisis and increasing competition from an internet full of alternative sources of information. We want rigorous journalists to receive the backing of the scientific community. By the same token we want to bring journalists into contact with the broader scientific community - established researchers but also early career researchers who are at the forefront of scientific knowledge in their field but usually don’t speak in the media. We also expect the project to help readers and particularly students assess the credibility of climate change information they read online. Vincent says Climate Feedback is funded and supported by the University of California, Merced and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), but they have had “contributions from private donors” too. I reckon all journalists should welcome this kind of feedback, although I’m now a little edgy that they might come after one of my stories.  Smiley face (by the way they don’t use smiley faces, but I think they should)?"

"China’s carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production may have been overestimated by as much as 14%, according to a new analysis by scientific researchers. The report, published in the journal Nature, estimates that in 2013, China’s CO2 emissions totalled 2.49 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, 14% less than previously thought. Over the period 2000-2013, it calculates that the difference is 2.9 gigatonnes, larger than China’s total forest sink – the amount of carbon it absorbs – between 1990 and 2007.   The report is the first time that fuel quality has been taken into consideration when completing emissions estimates in China. The authors attribute the difference mainly to the coal industry, estimating that the emission factors – the amount of carbon released by the coal – were on average 40% lower than what is recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Researchers reached the figures by analysing coal supply data from 4,200 coal mines. The report uses updated energy consumption data. Commenting on the implications of the new analysis, co-author Dabo Guan, a lead author on the fifth and latest climate change assessment report by the IPCC, told the Guardian:  “It doesn’t change the fact that China is the largest emitter in the world and it doesn’t suggest that they should do less in terms of climate change mitigation. In fact it puts China into a leading role in terms of creating a more accurate baseline for major developing countries – the foundation for any policy measures. If you don’t have an accurate baseline, any policy measures can be a number-crunching game. Developing countries are the major contributors to the future – having this sort of data is crucial for future climate change negotiations.” However, Guan cautioned that the analysis “does not prove that the IPCC is wrong”, while the report states that “estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty”. The uncertainty of China’s emissions estimates is typically reported as 5% to 10%.  Greenpeace China climate and energy campaigner, Li Shuo, responded to the paper, saying: “This new study highlights once again the problem of statistical quality when it comes to energy and emissions data in China. The major revisions proposed by this new paper are a sign, if not of inaccuracy, at least of significant uncertainty in our understanding of the fundamental variables of China’s emissions.  “Since China’s climate commitments are based on this data, it’s crucial that these challenges are recognised and the country’s capacity to account for its emissions strengthened. This is a timely reminder that any commitment to cutting carbon emissions negotiated at the Paris climate summit must be underpinned by an equally strong commitment to improve accuracy and transparency in the way emissions are measured and accounted for.” IPCC data on carbon emissions is produced through a calculation based both on the amount of fossil fuels produced and the carbon quality of the fuel. While the former can be obtained from national statistics, the latter is less widely available and the IPCC uses estimates based on averages across Europe and the US, said Guan. The report also found that total energy consumption in China was 10% higher in 2000–2012 than reported by China’s national statistics.  In 2010, China overtook the US to become the both the biggest producer and consumer of energy in the world. In June of this year its government submitted its commitment – ahead of December’s crunch international climate change conference in Paris – to cut its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% from 2005 levels. It followed an earlier landmark pledge to ensure its emissions peak by 2030. "
"Profits at npower have tumbled 60% as it struggles with billing problems which have sent customer complaints soaring. Many customers have been receiving late bills or no bills at all, since npower introduced a new billing system in 2013.  Npower, which is owned by the German utility RWE, revealed on Thursday that it had lost more than 300,000 customers over the past year, with many remaining customers using less energy. The company, which is one of the UK’s largest energy suppliers, does not expect to solve the billing problems until the end of 2016, despite last year’s warning from the regulator Ofgem to fix the issue by August 2014 or not take on new customers. The company insisted it was taking the right steps and said complaints had fallen to the lowest level since December 2011. At one time, hundreds of thousands of people were left unsure of how much they owed, which prompted Ofgem last month to rule that customers who had waited more than 28 days would get free energy until the problem was solved. The Ofgem investigation, which began over a year ago, is continuing and could also lead to fines. Npower was one of the most complained-about energy companies in 2014 and 2013, with customer problems still running high in the first half of 2015. The consumer watchdog Ombudsman’s Services reported in June that the majority of energy market complaints related to npower and Scottish Power, although the number of consumers contacting the ombudsman has fallen since the start of the year. Npower blamed billing problems for a 60% fall in UK profits: the company earned €53m (£38m) in the first six months of 2015, compared with €133m the year before.  “The main part of our drop in profits has been due to the continued impact of the systems issues that hit our domestic business last year,” the npower chief executive, Paul Massara, said.  “The challenges that we have faced were tougher than we expected but we know what the problems are and are taking the right steps to fix them. “Already this year, we’ve made real improvements for our customers, halving the number of complaints we receive, meaning complaints are at their lowest level since 2011.”  RWE revealed in its half-yearly report that it was “often only able to retain residential customers with expired contracts by offering them new contracts with more favourable conditions”.  The billing saga is a another headache for RWE, Germany’s second-largest utility company, which is grappling with low prices for the fossil fuels that dominate its business model.  RWE has a relatively small renewables business – 6% of annual electricity production – meaning it benefits less from favourable policies to promote renewable energy. The energy giant said it was experiencing a “crisis in conventional electricity generation”, amid declining gas and coal prices. Coal prices have been falling because of a slump in demand from China, dragging down the price utilities can charge for electricity across Europe. Gas prices, which closely track oil prices, have also fallen, offsetting stronger demand that came from colder temperatures in 2014, compared with the previous year. In Germany, gas prices are down 1-5% and in the UK by 4-8%, prompting npower rival British Gas to announce a 5% cut in prices. RWE pointed to the low price of power, as well as problems in the UK, as it unveiled an 11% decline in profits to €2.03bn. This “significant underperformance” on market expectations made it the worst performer in the energy sector, according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets. In a letter to shareholders, RWE chief executive Peter Terium also complained about the German government policy to phase out the most-polluting coal-fired power stations. Berlin wants to phase out lignite by 2021, although it was criticised by the Greens for abandoning plans for a climate change levy on the lignite-mining industry of the Rhineland. Terium said the debate over lignite made RWE “look like a football team that has been forced on to the back foot and robbed of its ability to play a free-flowing game”.  He added that the company was continuing to embark on growth projects, listing electricity supply in Slovenia, building up electricity and gas business in Poland and Hungary, as well as expansion of its renewables business via offshore windfarms."
"Tropical forests covering an area nearly the size of India are set to be destroyed in the next 35 years, a faster rate of deforestation than previously thought, a study warned on Monday.  The Washington-based Center for Global Development, using satellite imagery and data from 100 countries, predicted 289m hectares (714m acres) of tropical forests would be felled by 2050, with dangerous implications for accelerating climate change, the study said.  If current trends continued tropical deforestation would add 169bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2050, the equivalent of running 44,000 coal-fired power plants for a year, the study’s lead author told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  “Reducing tropical deforestation is a cheap way to fight climate change,” said environmental economist Jonah Busch. He recommended taxing carbon emissions to push countries to protect their forests.  UN climate change experts have estimated the world can burn no more than 1tn tonnes of carbon in order to keep global temperature rises below two degrees – the maximum possible increase to avert catastrophic climate change.  If trends continued the amount of carbon burned as a result of clearing tropical forests was equal to roughly one-sixth of the entire global carbon dioxide allotment, Busch said.  “The biggest driver of tropical deforestation by far is industrial agriculture to produce globally traded commodities including soy and palm oil.”  The study predicted the rate of deforestation would climb through 2020 and 2030 and accelerate around the year 2040 if changes were not made.  There were some success stories where countries reduced tropical deforestation without compromising economic growth or food production, the study said. Brazil decreased deforestation in the Amazon rainforest by 80% over a decade through the use of satellite monitoring and increased law enforcement, even as cattle and soy production rose."
"Anne-Marie Ndong Obiang has a machete attached to her belt, which she assures us is “for cutting off poachers’ fingers”. In her spotless forest-green camouflage uniform she does not appear to be joking. Working for Gabon’s National Parks Agency (ANPN) she has firsthand experience of the harsh conditions in the big reserves in the north of the country, some almost impenetrable. Gold prospectors, often from neighbouring Cameroon, have been known to leave craters 40 metres deep in the middle of the woods. Obiang is head of the Raponda Walker Arboretum close to the capital Libreville, which is on the Atlantic coast. Her priority here is to combat uncontrolled urban sprawl. “My fellow eco-wardens and myself can’t look the other way for a moment without someone starting to build beside the track,” she says. True enough quite substantial houses are springing up, with no planning permission, jeopardising the exceptional forest ecosystem that is bordered by a few sandy creeks – miraculously spared so far. To the south, the city is spreading unchecked. “We have about 40 endemic plant species here and we’re still identifying new ones, despite the airport being only 15 minutes away,” she says. Her favourite natural landmark is an Aleppo pine, 57 metres tall, which she likes showing to visiting schoolchildren. The equatorial forest is a key feature in Gabon’s identity, covering almost nine-tenths of the country. Until now the rate of deforestation has been less than 0.02% a year. The population is only 1.8 million, most people live in urban areas, and the economy is largely dependent on oil. “Out of 23 million hectares of woodland we’re currently exploiting less than two million,” says Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, permanent secretary of the National Climate Council “But we don’t intend to leave our forest under a cloche. We need to exploit it, with due restraint, because we’re keen to achieve emerging-economy status very soon.” In 2009 Gabon banned the export of whole logs, a trade which earns little and generates considerable waste. Instead it aims to develop timber processing. The gaboon tree (Aucoumea klaineana), used for making plywood, is an important source of foreign currency. The government also wants the country to grow more food. Meanwhile large rubber plantations are taking hold in the north and the authorities have announced that they want the country to become a leading source of palm oil. Gabon is, nevertheless, determined to contribute to mitigating climate change. On 31 March it became the first African state to submit pledges in preparation for the UN climate change conference to be held in Paris in November and December. In 2002 Gabon created protected nature reserves – 13 in one go – most of which are woodland and cover 13% of the country. Three, close to Libreville, form what is being developed as an Emerald Arc of green areas. Lee White has played an important part in this conservation work. “Preserving trees, which soak up carbon dioxide, is the cheapest way of mitigating climate change,” he says. He arrived in Africa 25 years ago to study great apes and now heads ANPN. “Gabon is a Noah’s ark for biodiversity, with forests three million years old,” he says. “The main threat from global warming here is an influx of refugees from the sub-Saharan fringes, who are driven south as the drought worsens in their homeland.” White says people need more immediate goals if they are to accept the strict rules needed to keep a protected forest in good health. The travel trade should be a source of new jobs, he says, so ANPN needs to become a long-term organisation, commanding public respect, along the same lines as its counterparts in Kenya or Costa Rica, which have succeeded in capitalising on their natural heritage. The agency needs money to pay forest wardens and provide facilities for visitors. It has drafted a range of plans for suspended walkways, playgrounds, hides for observing wildlife and lodges. “It wouldn’t take much for the whole thing to fall flat on its face. It’s a precarious situation,” says Eric Arnhem, senior technical adviser for the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society in Gabon. With oil prices plummeting, the worry is that Gabon is cutting back public spending, which directly reduces ANPN’s budget. France, through its overseas development agency AFD, has pledged €11m ($12.4m) to support the Emerald Arc scheme, as part of a €58m ($65.5m) fund for sustainable forest management between now and 2020. In practice the fund works by cancelling some of Gabon’s debt to France. “People don’t understand why we prevent them from hunting and clearing brush to grow ancestral crops. We have to explain over and over again that this environment protects us from flooding and coastal erosion,” says Ernest Ogandaga, leader of the town council in Akanda, north-east of Libreville. His municipality borders Akanda National Park. “There used to be a lot of trafficking here,” says Clotaire Moukagni Sika, conservation manager of the Akanda reserve. “Now we monitor the flow of migrants at the same time as poachers.” The biggest challenge, he says, was “uprooting” migrant fishermen from Benin and Nigeria, who pitched camps about 50 years ago at the mouth of the river that runs through the reserve. They cut down mangroves to smoke their catch, and hunted for monitor lizards and dwarf crocodiles, the latter a protected species. Above all, their nets obstructed the estuary, preventing young fish from reaching the ocean. The mangroves have since recovered and are now 5km deep. Pelicans, herons and stork have reappeared on the mudflats, but the fishermen have had to move out to the open sea. They complain about the hazards this involves, in particular the threats from unauthorised trawlers. They blame the park for ousting them. But there are other more serious problems. Further down the coast towards Libreville the state of the mangroves deteriorates, with countless plastic bottles and other waste entangled in their roots, a sad reminder of urban degradation.

"Climate change will have irreversible and unprecedented impacts on crucial ocean microorganisms that could trigger dramatic effects further up the food chain, according to scientists.  The bacteria trichodesmium is known for surviving in nutrient-poor parts of the ocean, where it converts nitrogen gas into a material that can be used by other forms of life – from plankton to whales – which all require it to grow.   This process of “nitrogen fixation” makes the bacteria “the fertilising agent of the open ocean”, says Eric Webb, co-author of the study published in Nature Communications. Although a microorganism, it forms in colonies that can be seen by the naked eye, earning it the name “sea sawdust”. When the scientists placed it in conditions simulating carbon dioxide levels in 85 years’ time, the bacteria went into reproductive overdrive. The scientists say that this could cause it to go into reproductive overdrive in the future, consuming vast quantities of nutrients – such as iron and phosphorus – that are in limited supply in the ocean. This could leave other organisms that depend on the same nutrients without enough to survive. Alternatively, greater numbers of trichodesmium could consume the resources at an unsustainable rate, creating the conditions for its own extinction. This could in turn leave other organisms without the products processed through “nitrogen fixation” by the bacteria, triggering catastrophic effects much further up the marine food chain, on creatures such as fish. When the same bacteria was then put back into present day conditions the behaviour change was unexpectedly discovered to be permanent. The scientists say that the finding that the bacteria would “get stuck in the fast lane” calls into question basic evolutionary principles. Webb told the Guardian: “The fact it grows fast and gets stuck in that state is unprecedented in evolutionary biology and could have dramatic effects on its natural, very-low nutrient oceanic habitat. This unchecked growth will likely cause it to produce nitrogen, but it will also consume other nutrients at increased rates. As these nutrients are predicted to be more scarce in the future, the combination of these factors could lead to its extinction in the worst case scenario.” The researchers bred the bacteria over the course of five years at carbon dioxide levels predicted for 2100 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scientists say that more research is now needed to establish why this irreversible evolution occurs.  Prof Toby Tyrrell at the national oceanography centre at the University of Southampton, who did not work on the project, said: “It’s remarkable that the effect of high CO2 is seen to persist even when the cells are returned to low CO2. This is surprising. It’s not obvious why such an effect should occur.  “It’s possible that it will not hold true in nature though. Previous studies showing short-term increases in nitrogen fixation at high CO2 were found to disappear when the cells were grown under more realistic conditions.”"
"Humans have exhausted a year’s supply of natural resources in less than eight months, according to an analysis of the demands the world’s population are placing on the planet. The Earth’s “overshoot day” for 2015, the point at which humanity goes into ecological debt, will occur on Thursday six days earlier than last year, based on an estimate by the Global Footprint Network (GFN). The date is based on a comparison of humanity’s demands – in terms of carbon emissions, cropland, fish stocks, and the use of forests for timber – with the planet’s ability to regenerate such resources and naturally absorb the carbon emitted. That implies the excess demands being placed on natural systems are doing more permanent harm that cannot be easily undone.   The GFN estimates that human consumption first began to exceed the Earth’s capacity in the early 1970s and the overshoot day has been falling steadily earlier ever since, due to the growth in the global population alongside the expansion of consumption around the world.  Mathis Wackernagel, president of the GFN told the Guardian: “The big problem is not that our deficit is getting bigger, it is that it cannot be maintained in the long-run. Even though we are in a deficit equation we are not taking measures to take us in the right direction. The problem is psychological – somehow we are missing this basic physical law. It is obvious to children, but for 98% of economic planners it is a minor risk not worth our attention. In the end the question is – does it matter to the government?” The GFN estimate that the world’s population currently consumes the equivalent of 1.6 planets. This figure should rise to two planets by 2030 based on current trends. On a per capita basis, the UK consumes around three times more than the equivalent level that ecosystems can renew, but its relative share is dropping as developing economies grow and consume more.  The impact of this “ecological deficit” can be witnessed through deforestation, soil erosion, depletion of water resources and the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Wackernagel added that the UN’s crunch international climate change conference in Paris in December and global diplomatic efforts were providing hope for change. “The conference in December is sparking conversations and we are seeing unheard of agreements between the US and China,” he said.  “The two biggest emitters are starting to co-operate and the G20 leaders have recognised we have to move out of fossil fuels by the end of this century – although this is a bit too slow in my opinion.”"

"Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (GPS), a division within Citibank (America’s third-largest bank), recently published a report looking at the economic costs and benefits of a low-carbon future. The report considered two scenarios: “Inaction,” which involves continuing on a business-as-usual path, and Action scenario which involves transitioning to a low-carbon energy mix. One of the most interesting findings in the report is that the investment costs for the two scenarios are almost identical. In fact, because of savings due to reduced fuel costs and increased energy efficiency, the Action scenario is actually a bit cheaper than the Inaction scenario.  What is perhaps most surprising is that looking at the potential total spend on energy over the next quarter century, on an undiscounted basis the cost of following a low carbon route at $190.2 trillion is actually cheaper than our ‘Inaction’ scenario at $192 trillion. This, as we examine in this chapter, is due to the rapidly falling costs of renewables, which combined with lower fuel usage from energy efficiency investments actually result in significantly lower long term fuel bill. Yes, we have to invest more in the early years, but we potentially save later, not to mention the liabilities of climate change that we potentially avoid. The following figure from the Citi report breaks down the investment costs in the Action ($190.2 trillion) and Inaction ($192 trillion) scenarios. This conclusion soundly refutes the main argument against climate action – that it’s too expensive, with some contrarians even having gone so far as to claim that cutting carbon pollution will create an economic catastrophe. To the contrary, the Citi report finds that these investments will save money, before even accounting for the tremendous savings from avoiding climate damage costs. What about those avoided climate costs? As shown in the bottom left corner of the above figure, the difference in climate damage costs between low (1.5°C) warming and high (4.5°C) warming scenarios could be as high as $50 trillion. Even moderate (2.5°C) warming could cost $30 trillion less than a business-as-usual high global warming scenario. As a result, the Citi report concludes that taking action to cut carbon pollution and slow global warming would result in a positive return on investment. By comparing the cost of mitigation to the avoided ‘liabilities’ of climate change, we can derive a simple ‘return on investment’. On a risk adjusted basis this implies a return of 1-4% at the low point in 2021, rising to between 3% and 10% by 2035. This isn’t a groundbreaking finding. Other reports have arrived at the same conclusion, and have found that a revenue-neutral carbon tax would be modestly beneficial for the economy (again, before accounting for the economic benefits of curbing global warming). This is why there’s a consensus among economists that we should be reducing carbon pollution. The Citi report then asks the trillion-dollar question – if tackling global warming is such an economic no-brainer, what are we waiting for? With a limited differential in the total bill of Action vs Inaction (in fact a saving on an undiscounted basis), potentially enormous liabilities avoided and the simple fact that cleaner air must be preferable to pollution, a very strong “Why would you not?” argument regarding action on climate change begins to form … Coupled with the fact the total spend is similar under both action and inaction, yet the potential liabilities of inaction are enormous, it is hard to argue against a path of action. Dave Roberts at Vox took a stab at answering that question, and the answer is touched upon in the Citi report: The clear loser between the scenarios is coal, which sees its total investment bill fall by some $11.5 trillion over the next quarter century. Gas investment also reduces though by a far smaller amount, $3.4 trillion in total While the global economy would clearly benefit from climate action, it would create “stranded assets” for the fossil fuel industry, because a large percentage of known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground if we’re to avoid dangerous climate change. Some studies suggest that globally a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves would have to remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to have a chance of meeting the 2°C target. The fossil fuel industry has extensive influence over many world governments. They hire Merchants of Doubt to spread disinformation and uncertainty about the science and economics of climate change, and spend billions of dollars in campaign contributions to American political candidates in order to delay the low-carbon transition that would benefit the global economy and most people. They can’t, however, change the scientific and economic realities that clearly indicate we must take action to minimize the damages from human-caused global warming. As the Citi report concludes, the international climate conference in Paris at the end of this year will be a critical opportunity for world leaders to finally commit to curbing global warming for the benefit of the vast majority, at the expense of the few wealthy and powerful fossil fuel interests. Paris offers a generational opportunity; one that we believe should be firmly grasped with both hands."
"The Abbott government has signed off on detailed rules for its Direct Action climate policy, which experts say will allow big industry to actually increase greenhouse emissions. The so-called “safeguards mechanism” is supposed to ensure that increased emissions from heavy industry and electricity generators do not undo the reductions bought through the government’s $2.5bn scheme.  The environment minister, Greg Hunt, is asking for feedback on the detail of the laws and is likely to get some from independent senator Nick Xenophon, who has accused the government of reneging on a promise of “credible” safeguards made to secure his critical vote for the Direct Action legislation. He has proposed amendments to give the scheme “teeth”. Market analysts Reputex say the new rules leave major industry “largely free to grow their emissions” because the “baselines” have been set too high to make any difference, and industry has been given even more ways to avoid penalties if they are exceeded. Reputex says the detailed rules, signed off by cabinet on Tuesday, confirm that none of Australia’s top 20 emitting facilities – including brown coal-fired power stations Loy Yang A and B and Hazelwood, and new LNG processing facilities such as Wheatstone, Gorgon, Itchys and Pluto – will be forced to reduce emissions. Erwin Jackson from the Climate Institute thinktank said the rules would do nothing to reduce emissions and would continue the “quagmire of uncertainty” that made business decision-making impossible. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the only thing being “safeguarded” was the big polluters’ right to pollute. Analysts believe Australia may meet its minimum target to reduce emissions by 5% by 2020, because the government has revised the starting point from which the reductions are measured and because of falling industrial activity, the demise of some manufacturing sectors and falling demand for electricity. But almost all analysis suggests it would be impossible for Direct Action to meet the target the government has set for 2030 – a fall of between 26% and 28% compared with 2005 levels. An unprecedented alliance of business, welfare and environmental groups and trade unions recently demanded an end to Australia’s climate policy paralysis, issuing principles including that Australia be able to buy cheaper international permits, and that greenhouse reductions occur “across all sections of the economy”. Hunt has said access to international permits would be decided when the safeguards mechanism was reviewed in 2017-18, and has on occasions said it could be tightened to force electricity generators and industry to reduce emissions after 2020. But doing that would set up a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme, imposing costs on industry and generators that would be passed through to consumers – cutting across the government’s attack on Labor’s promise to reintroduce an emissions trading scheme. In internal government discussions the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and his office have been very concerned the safeguards mechanism should never turn into a de facto carbon price or a cost burden on emitting industries. When draft details of the safeguards mechanism were released, Xenophon, who provided one of the six votes the government needed to get Direct Action through the Senate last July, said it had been “neutered” and accused the government of reneging on promises it made to secure his vote. “Direct Action has no point if it does not have an effective safeguards mechanism, and what the government has released seems like a try-on,” he said. “It goes against what they promised me in the discussions before the vote. I was assured this safeguards mechanism would have real teeth. “There is no point in the government spending $2.55bn if there is no requirement to cap or reduce emissions from industry.” The safeguards mechanism applies to facilities with more than 100,000 tonnes of emissions a year. The “baselines” which may not be exceeded will be set at the highest reported emissions over the five-year period from 2009-10 to 2013-14."

"I remember the worst idea for a climate change campaign I’ve ever heard.  It was November 2008, and a well-meaning friend – having just discovered how much household energy bills can rise at Christmas with all the extra lighting in use – suggested that the wastefulness of the festive season could be a great “hook” for getting people thinking about energy consumption.  Fortunately, his campaign against Christmas never came to fruition. But unwittingly putting out a counterproductive message can happen in more subtle ways too.  For instance, the Plane Stupid activists who disrupted Heathrow’s schedules in July in a protest against the airport’s proposed new runway are fighting an important battle. Increasing the UK’s high-carbon infrastructure is an irresponsible and short-sighted move. But while they may have been clear in their own minds that high-end business flights were the target of their intervention, this wasn’t how many commentators on social media saw it. Delays and cancellations to hard-earned summer holiday flights are about as popular as the fight against festive fairly lights. In both cases, the problem is a clash between environmental sustainability and old-fashioned fun. Of course, people enjoyed themselves in the days before jet planes and illuminated Santas on their roofs. But from feasting to flying, hedonism has historically tended to be closely coupled to over-consumption.  So are environmental campaigns always doomed to land on the wrong side of the hedonistic divide? Or is there a case for leaving the “fun stuff” to one side for now – giving hedonism a temporary exemption from the carbon audit – and focusing on the more mundane (and far more common) examples of everyday wastefulness first?  Take the time-honoured late-night ritual of putting the rubbish out. Whichever way you look at it, it is boring. It was boring before councils started asking us to separate our recycling, and it is only slightly more time-consuming to put different items in different boxes. And yet many still don’t bother, even though doing the right thing environmentally is no real hardship. There are plenty more examples like it. Shouldn’t we exhaust these possibilities before we go after the things we actually enjoy? The comedian David Mitchell expressed his frustration with environmentalists who claim that quitting fossil fuels will be fun in an episode of Soapbox. According to Mitchell, tackling climate change is less a fantastic adventure and more like tidying your room: annoying but necessary. Mitchell’s logic could be extended to things that actually are fun, but feel compelled to present themselves as sustainable. Every year, there is collective handwringing over the mess left behind by summer festival-goers. Glastonbury comes in for particular criticism, as the disconnect between the projected values of the festival (peace, love and environmental harmony) and the detritus from 200,000 people getting drunk in a temporary town for four days can seem especially jarring.  In response, festivals have taken steps to clean up their act: cups are re-used, efforts are made to promote car-sharing; donations to environmental charities are encouraged. But none of this can do much to hide the fact that most modern festivals are a carnival of consumption, and for most people who attend them, this is a major part of the appeal. For years now, the production team Arcadia have taken a giant metal fire-breathing spider around the British festival scene. This year, it forms part of Bristol’s European Green Capital celebrations, burning recycled biofuels rather than oil from the Canadian tar sands.  But this is still a giant metal spider that burns fuel for no reason other than that it looks amazing. And it does look amazing. But like posters at the Benidorm arrivals lounge that warn of the dangers of binge-drinking, slapping a “sustainable” sticker on the spider’s side feels like the worst of both worlds. There is so much carbon expended unnecessarily: can’t we save the fun stuff until last? In the same way that wealthy countries should be obliged to make more drastic cuts to their carbon budgets in order to make room for the development of nations that have done less to poison the well, we should prioritise cutting the carbon that gives no happiness.  From the metropolitan office lights glinting miserably at night, to the soul-sapping rush-hour traffic jams that could be eliminated by an affordable public transport system, there is no shortage of dull practices that could be vastly improved by a low-carbon makeover. So let’s leave the Christmas lights for the time being, and enjoy the metal fire-breathing spider for what it is: a ludicrous, crowd-pleasing spectacle, not an exercise in studied ecological restraint.

"Climate change is bringing small risks that tropical cyclones will form in the Persian Gulf for the first time, in a threat to cities such as Dubai or Doha which are unprepared for big storm surges, a US study said on Monday.  Tampa in Florida and Cairns in Australia, two places where cyclones already happen, would be increasingly vulnerable to extreme storms this century, according to the report, based on thousands of computer models.   The shallow and warm waters of the Persian Gulf, where cyclones have never been recorded, might generate the storms in future as a side-effect of global warming, according to the study in the journal Nature Climate Change.  “You can’t always rely on history” to predict the future, lead author Ning Lin of Princeton University told Reuters of the findings she reached with Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  For the Persian Gulf the probability of cyclones “is very low but ... if you build a nuclear power plant you have to consider these things,” she said.  For Dubai, for instance, a storm surge of 1.9 metres (6 feet and 3 inches) in height could be expected once every 1,000 years based on recent climate warming, and one of 4 metres (13 feet and one inch) once every 10,000 years, the scientists estimated.  They dubbed such extreme tropical cyclones “grey swans”, saying they could not be predicted from history alone. The metaphor is inspired by “black swans”, judged impossible by Europeans until they were found in Australia.  Some past studies have also pointed to risks of abrupt changes in the climate system linked to global warming, including that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer or that monsoon rains could veer off track.  Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a vice chair of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the build-up of greenhouse gases from human activities means more energy accumulates in the climate system.  “Bad climate surprises may happen,” he told Reuters at UN talks in Bonn on a deal to slow climate change.  Monday’s study said the closest cyclone to the Persian Gulf was in 2007, when Cyclone Gonu in the Arabian Sea struck Oman and Iran, killing 78 people and causing $4.4bn (£2.8) in damage.  The study said that extreme hurricanes now likely to hit Tampa only once every 1,000 years, causing a storm surge of 4.6 metres, would occur every 60 to 450 years by the late 21st century. Cairns would also be vulnerable to worsening storms."
"The Dutch government will appeal against a district court ruling ordering it to cut emissions of greenhouse gases faster than currently planned, in a politically sensitive case that is being closely watched by policy-makers abroad.  Deputy Minister for the Environment Wilma Mansveld wrote in a letter to parliament on Tuesday that the government would contest the 24 June ruling which ordered it to slash emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020.   But the government said it will also begin implementing the lower court’s ruling because the filing of an appeal does not undo its obligation to comply.  Urgenda, an environmental group that filed the lawsuit on behalf of 900 Dutch co-plaintiffs, said it looked forward to the appeal process and urged the government to do more to slow climate change.  Marjan Minessma, the Dutch NGO’s director, said: “I don’t think that they [the government] will win this.”  She said that the government could choose to let the result stand but ask the highest court for a ruling on whether such kinds of cases – i.e. those challenging government decisions – can be brought in future.  The ruling, a rare intervention by the judiciary in the global warming debate, is being closely watched by policy makers and environmentalists as a legal precedent.  Mansveld’s letter said it was the first time that a judge found that the government should achieve a minimum emissions reduction.  The government of conservative prime minister Mark Rutte “questions the application of international law,” and agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, it said.  “Due to the consequences for climate policy...it is desirable for the ruling to be considered by a higher court,” it said.  The Netherlands, a laggard among developed countries in cutting emissions after reducing spending on alternative energy during the financial crisis, used record amounts of coal in the first five months of this year.  Dutch greenhouse gas emissions fell 5% in 2014 from a year earlier, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) said on Tuesday, citing the mild winter and lower fossil fuel use.  “These lower emissions were dampened by higher use of coal and less gas by electricity producers,” it said. “Emissions were 15% than 1990 levels.“  Based on current government policy, the Netherlands will achieve a reduction of 17% at most in 2020, which is below a norm of 25-40% for developed countries, a summary of the ruling said.  Not many developed countries are on track in making deep cuts such as those as demanded by the court, which were based on scenarios by the UN panel of climate scientists in 2007 for limiting rising temperatures.  The European Union is targeting reductions of at least 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels, while the United States is aiming for about a 4% cut."

"Australians should take to the streets to protest over the treatment of refugees in Nauru that is “tantamount to torture” rather than just focus on the activities of the border force in Melbourne, Canadian author Naomi Klein has said. Klein, appearing on ABC’s Q&A program, said the policy of keeping asylum seekers in offshore detention centres was more disturbing than last week’s aborted Australian Border Force operation in Melbourne, which prompted protestors to gather outside Flinders Street station. A furious backlash against a plan for border force agents to check the visa status of people in central Melbourne saw the operation hastily ditched before it began. The government has blamed a clumsily worded press release for the furore, denying there would be random checks of the public. “I’d like to see people rise up in streets of Melbourne and the streets of Sydney about what’s happening in Nauru,” Klein said. “The United Nations has said what’s happening on Nauru is tantamount to torture in some cases. The stories are horrific; people sewing their mouths shut they are so desperate. “Frankly I’m a lot more shocked by the fact that migrants made refugees by wars that your government and my government have participated in are sent to islands so far away, locked away with no hope so they take their own lives. “I find that more shocking than they fact they were going to check papers on the streets of Melbourne, although I think that’s a problem too.” Fellow panellists Tariq Ali, a British author, and Laurie Penny, a British feminist writer, agreed with Klein. Ali said the proposed Australian Border Force action “creates a climate of fear”, adding that he wished he’d joined in the protest himself. A tough border protection policy helps boost confidence in a large-scale immigration policy But another panellist, conservative writer and analyst Tom Switzer, said that a distinction needed to be made between the “overreach” of the scrapped visa checking operation and Australia’s overall immigration policies. “People broadly speaking support the policies,” he said. “It’s brutal stuff, no question, but it sends a deterrent and European governments are looking to the Australian model because border security is now a big issue in European politics. “There is a widespread tradition in this country that a tough border protection policy helps boost confidence in a large-scale immigration policy.” Switzer and Klein also clashed over climate change, which is the topic of Klein’s latest book, This Changes Everything, which argues that capitalism is unsuited to tackling the issue of soaring greenhouse gas emissions. Switzer, who said many environmentalists are “watermelons” because they conceal “socialist agendas”, said Klein’s call to racially reshape capitalism is “a radical agenda, it’s bad politics because stands almost no chance of gaining widespread support, not just in Australia especially in developing countries chugging their smoking path to prosperity”. “For all its flaws, capitalism is responsible for lifting so many people out of poverty. If you undermine capitalism you are going to entrench poverty and people would rightly say it’s not only immoral, it’s wicked.” Switzer said that while most conservatives in Australia accept that human activity is influencing the climate, temperatures are only rising “marginally” and they are “not going up in accordance with the models” put forward by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Klein said conservatives needed to be “scientifically honest” and argued that climate change challenges a worldview that opposes collective action. “Our attempts to just tinker around the edges, have a carbon trading scheme here, change our light bulbs there, has seen our emissions go up by 63%,” she said. “That model [capitalism] isn’t working. Climate change provides an unyielding science-based deadline. We have to supercharge our efforts.” Klein added that Australia’s lack of renewable energy in its electricity grid is “scandalous” given its potential solar and wind resources."

"This month, I broke the law. I wasn’t alone; I was with 1,500 others, many of whom had never broken any law for their beliefs before. Together we managed to shut down Europe’s biggest source of CO2 emissions: RWE’s lignite mines in the Rhineland in Germany. In total, around 800 of us were arrested, and hundreds of us refused to cooperate with the authorities by withholding our names and IDs. This hampered the bureaucracy so badly that we were released without charge. It was the world’s largest act of disobedience against the mining of fossil fuels – and it might be the spark that ignites a rising, cross-border movement of disobedience for climate justice.  With a circumference of 20km and a depth of 400 metres, the open-cast mine is the biggest hole I have ever seen. It feels part-desert, part post-apocalyptic movie set, a place that belongs more on Mars than on Earth. It’s a hole that makes money for a few and imposes misery on most. It has eaten up so many homes and lives: since the second world war, lignite mines have displaced 35,000 people – and 7,000 more await a similar fate. Abandoned villages sit on the mine’s edge, with empty streets, churches, schools and hospitals, and ivy growing through broken letter boxes. Even the bodies from the graveyards have had to be moved to safety. These ghost villages then wait to be engulfed by the ever-expanding hole. The mine and its accompanying power stations are surrounded by fields of industrial wind turbines, a greenwashed, “eco-friendly” back drop, to make us forget that the “great green” German state – which is phasing out nuclear power, and is renowned for its “renewable energy transition” – still produces 45% of its electricity with coal. Thousands had been preparing for this moment of disobedience for a week at the Climate Camp, a temporary model of an alternative society set up near the mine. At dawn on Saturday 15 August, we left the camp, with its self-managed workshops, trainings, film shows and lectures, approaching the mine from four different directions in “fingers” – long columns of about 250 people all dressed in white paper boiler suits. Our only protection against police truncheons and pepper spray was bags filled with soft straw to take the blows. Everyone on the action had agreed to remain calm and were determined not to escalate any police violence or sabotage the mine’s machinery. To get to the mine we had to go through a narrow tunnel. But it was blocked by vans and three rows of riot police. It was terrifying, yet we knew what to do. We took a deep collective breath and our finger flowed like a river into the obstruction, body against body, the whole column pushing from behind. In the crush I saw truncheons flailing, one hit me but the adrenaline cut out the pain. Pepper spray was aimed directly at our eyes. Time stood still and then … we were through. Despite 1,500 police officers and 800 RWE employees protecting the site, nothing could stop such collective courage. Eight hundred of us got into the mine, and some as far as the monstrous excavators. These are 222 metres long, and taller than the Statue of Liberty. Half a dozen of them continuously gnaw at the canyon sides of the mine, each one able to dig out 2,400 train carriages of coal a day. These are machines engineered to cut through mountains. Down in the depths of the mine, we were again chased by police, this time riding on RWE-owned 4x4s. But we just kept running towards the machines. Group after group was eventually arrested and handcuffed and held for nine hours in the deep sand of the mine, but we nourished ourselves with acts of tender solidarity. Unable to feed ourselves, people passed food from mouth to mouth, kissing relative strangers in the process. And around us everything was blocked, the machines were silent; we had forced the mine to stop for an entire day. The protest was called Ende Gelände (Here and no further) – and it was direct action at its best. Not a symbolic gesture that just tells a story and makes an injustice visible, but an action that targeted the very source of the problem and stopped it in its tracks. Of course, the stories from the day are important, and will help build confidence within the movement. But the actual stopping of CO2 emissions themselves, the fact that the lignite coal – the dirtiest type of coal in the world – was not dug out and burned that day, is what counts. Ende Gelände was a collective act of resistance that for once felt proportionate to the scale of the emergency: catastrophic climate change. The fact that 80% of the world’s fossil fuel reserves need to remain unburned if we are to avoid the catastrophe of runaway climate change means that we will have to fight with every tactic we think is just, strategic and, most importantly, effective. Historically, when movements win it is because they fought harder than they thought was possible and used a whole range of means. It is time to move away from purely symbolic and ritualised displays of dissent and use tactics that are proportionate to the problems. This is what our children will judge us on. They won’t ask: “Did you march in the streets or sabotage the machines at night?” They will ask: “Did you manage to stop them destroying our planet?” At Ende Gelände, thousands experienced a collective power. I have never seen so many people jump so far out of their comfort zones, by taking direct action for the first time. Never have I been part of such disciplined, determined disobedience. A line has been drawn in the sand. When the COP21 UN climate summit takes place in Paris, and thousands take part in a day of disobedience on 12 December, the shout from the streets may well, once again, be: Ende Gelände. The corporations and governments have failed us. It’s time for direct action."

"The independent Climate Change Authority is engaged in a public war of words with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, over the government’s assertion that “Labor’s climate policy” would impose a “$600bn carbon bill”, saying the claim is “weird” and “misleading”. The prime minister on Tuesday unveiled a new greenhouse gas reduction goal of reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030.  One day before that announcement, the Daily Telegraph revisited modelling done in 2013 for the CCA of a 40 to 60% emissions reduction target, in a front-page story headlined “ALP’s $600bn carbon bill”. The paper argued the cost was attributable to Labor because the party has said it would base its long-term targets on up-to-date advice from the CCA. Labor has not yet announced its preferred 2030 target. Abbott then used the same figure to claim Labor’s policy would “hit our economy with massive and unmanageable costs, massive increases in power prices, massive increase in the hit on families’ cost of living”. But in a statement released late Friday, CCA chairman and former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser said: “Others have wrongly claimed that the authority’s own modelling shows that the 40 to 60 target would impose very high costs – in the order of $600bn – on the economy. This is not correct.” Within half an hour Hunt had issued a retaliatory statement, saying “the modelling clearly shows the cumulative hit to GDP from Labor’s carbon tax would be more than $600bn by 2030 in nominal terms”. In an interview with Guardian Australia on Saturday, Fraser insisted the government’s assertion was wrong. “Some people who don’t understand modelling draw inferences that really can’t be drawn,” he said. “This is a good illustration of the difficulties modelling can create when misinterpreted to derive misleading meanings.” “This $600bn figure is not drawn from any logical process and it becomes weirder and weirder the more that you look at it. It compares a scenario where Australia has a 44% target by 2030 and the rest of the world is taking very strong action, with a scenario where Australia has no target and does nothing and the rest of the world does very little, almost nothing at all. It is the inferred cost difference between those two scenarios. “If you wanted a figure with some logical credibility or relevance you would model the cost of the government’s 26% target and a 40% target for 2030 and look at the difference between those two.” In fact the government has received modelling of the economic cost of its own target and a target similar to the one it asserts Labor will adopt. That modelling, by leading economist Warwick McKibbin, showed the 26% target would shave between 0.2% and 0.4% from Australian GDP in 2030, but the same modelling found that based on similar assumptions, a 35% target would cut only 0.3% to 0.5% and a 45% target would cut between 0.5% and 0.7%. The $600bn figure is based on a GDP cost in 2030 of over 2%. The government has not yet released that modelling, but says it will do so in coming days. It had intended to abolish the CCA but could not get the support of the Senate to do so. Fraser also said the government’s new target is not “in the middle of the pack” of similar countries, as the prime minister has asserted, but rather “at or near the bottom of the group of countries we generally compare ourselves with”. Fraser said with the “right” policies the authority was confident “more ambitious targets than those adopted by the government can be achieved at modest costs”. Under the deal the government did with the Palmer United party to pass its Direct Action policy, the CCA has been asked to look at alternative climate policies. But Fraser says it is difficult to do that assessment while the government makes false claims about emissions trading schemes every time they are publicly mentioned. “The authority’s current work on the case for a market-based ETS for Australia is obviously occurring in a difficult environment,” he says. “While part of the minister’s terms of reference to the authority, the very idea of an ETS (and those raising the idea) are criticised by government members every time it surfaces, asserting it is a ‘tax’ (which it is not in substantial respects), which will have major economic and social consequences (which is not the experience of those countries where ETSs are prominent components of their climate policy tool kits). “Major decisions are looming as to how the inevitable costs of achieving large reductions in emissions are best funded – through, for example, expansion of the government’s Emissions Reduction Fund activities, which are financed directly from the budget, and/or through market-based mechanisms like an ETS. However this conundrum is eventually resolved, substantial shifts in much of the current thinking and rhetoric around these issues can be expected,” he says."

"With 100 days to go until the Paris climate summit, the EU’s climate chief has warned that progress in thrashing out a draft negotiating text is proceeding too slowly and urgently needs to be stepped up. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate commissioner, said that the 85-page draft agreement currently being poured over by diplomats still contains far too many bracketed options that need to be rapidly narrowed.  “In the negotiating rooms, progress has been painfully slow. The technical talks are seriously lagging behind the political discussion and this must change,” Cañete told a press conference in Brussels. “The window of opportunity... is closing fast.” The alarm call from Brussels follows sharp interventions from the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and French climate ambassador, Laurence Tubiana in recent weeks. Cañete called for diplomats to show flexibility, and move beyond their negotiating “comfort zones” as a matter of priority. “When it comes to substance, the text is still far too long, with all options put forward by countries still on the table. This has to be negotiated as soon as possible,” he said. Climate pledges have now been received from 56 countries, which collectively represent some 61% of global emissions. But these ‘INDCs’ (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) are not thought ambitious enough to chart a course for limiting global warming to the UN target of 2C. An analysis by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change earlier this week found that pledges made so far would have to almost double by 2030 to have a more than 50% chance of limiting global warming to 2C. Cañete confirmed that the bloc would not back an agreement “on the basis of a minimal level of common agreement”. The EU believes that any successful deal will need substantial emission cutting goals, a five-yearly review process to increase ambitions until the 2C target is met, ambitious goals for 2050 and 2100, and robust transparency and accounting rules. But deeply-ingrained divisions have plagued negotiations in Bonn over issues such as financing for a $100bn-a-year climate finance pot due by 2020, and the distribution of emissions cuts between rich and poor countries. The EU and US also disagree sharply over the legally-binding nature of any global pact, although Cañete stressed that the bloc’s alliances are evolving and provisional. “We’re playing different chess games at the same time, and with different strategies. But the objective is clear,” Cañete said. He called on the US and other countries opposed to placing emissions reductions under legal sanction to come forward with alternative ways of monitoring and correcting unfulfilled commitments. G20 countries such as India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey needed to submit their INDC’s “without delay,” he added. "
"We know that as humans emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, it causes the Earth to warm. But it also causes other climate changes that are less obvious. In some instances, it makes areas wetter (because there is more moisture in the air as temperature increases). This can lead to increased flooding. In other instances, it speeds evaporation so that droughts can set in more quickly and deeply. While it would appear these affects would offset each other, in reality more droughts or floods occur depending on where you are located.  In some instances, areas are experiencing more severe droughts and more flooding as the weather systems swing from dry to wet quickly. Added to this is the fact that ocean temperatures have an enormous influence on weather.   As an example, an El Niño, which is the appearance of a warm water pool in the Pacific Ocean, can influence weather across the globe. Human-caused warming of the oceans adds to the El Niño cycles, which in turn affect the atmosphere. The real scientific question is, do human greenhouse gases influence a specific flood or drought event? A growing body of science is finding that the answer to this question is yes. A paper just published in Geophysical Research Letters looked at the May 2015 floods in Texas and Oklahoma in the USA, which resulted from the wettest single month on record in both states. The lead author, Dr. Wang from Utah State and his colleagues examined the role of strengthened El Niño teleconnections on the flood event. Before getting into their conclusions, a little background is important.  In the Pacific Ocean, there is a water temperature oscillation that occurs every few years. This oscillation happens near the equator and stretches from South America almost all the way to Australia. During one part of the oscillation, there is colder than normal waters (called the La Niña phase) while in the other part of the oscillation, the waters are warm (called El Niño). Many times, the water temperatures are near normal, and we call that a neutral phase. This process has large global consequences. First, when the ocean is in the warm El Niño phase, global surface temperatures rise temporarily. When in the La Niña phase, the temperatures temporarily drop. These short-term rises and falls last just a year or so and are superimposed on a long-term temperature increase from greenhouse gases. The cycle also has big implications for rainfall patterns around the globe.  Dr. Wang and his authors recognized that in a warming world, the way El Niño intensifies rainfall patterns would change. That is, today’s El Niños may be more potent than prior El Niños. In particular, they compared the El Niño influence from 1948–1980 with the influence after 1980. They used a wide collection of measurements and modeling tools and concluded,  The record precipitation that occurred over Texas and Oklahoma during the month of May 2015 was the results of a series of climate interactions and anomalies. Foremost is the role that El Niño played. A developing ENSO (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) has a tendency to increase spring precipitation over the southern Great Plains and this effect was found to have intensified since 1980; this intensification was concomitant with a warmer atmosphere due to anthropogenic (human) greenhouse gases.  Specifically, the intensified ENSO teleconnection appears to be triggered by enhanced latent heat in the equatorial central Pacific, and is associated with a broad sea surface temperature warming in the tropics. In essence, there was a detectable effect of anthropogenic global warming in the teleconnection and moisture transport leading to Mays 2015’s high precipitation. Also worth noting is the potential for predicting extreme events like the Texas floods. ENSO impacts are one of the few climate anomalies forecasters today have a better handle of. This paper notes that the chance for Texas and Oklahoma to experience an abnormally wet season in May was predicted as early as in March, according to computer models used by the Climate Prediction Center. What remains challenging is how scientists can anticipate the extraordinary magnitude of precipitation as fell in Texas and, if they do see it, how can the right information reach people. The detection of human influence on extreme weather is a rapidly maturing field and each year we are finding more and more evidence of the connections. The corollary is that without efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, we can expect more frequent and intense extreme weather in the future."
"The US government has urged the international community to focus more on the impact of climate change on the oceans, amid growing concern over changes affecting corals, shellfish and other marine life.  The US will raise the issue at United Nations climate talks in Paris later this year. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will be asked to devote more research to the issue. “We are asking the IPCC in their next series of reports to focus more on ocean and cryosphere [ice ecosystem] issues,” David Balton, deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries at the US State Department, said. “In my judgment, more attention needs to be paid to the climate change effects upon the ocean areas of the world,” Balton said. “We need to keep pushing up until the Paris conference and beyond.  “Ultimately, we need to change the way we live if we’re to keep the planet in the safe zone.” Around half of all greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels and other activities are absorbed by the world’s oceans, which are warming steadily. This has caused sea levels to rise and the oceans to become around 30% more acidic than in pre-industrial times. In acidic water, corals and shellfish struggle to form skeletons and shells. An Australian-led study released this week, which examined the impact of climate change on 13,000 marine species, found that while some fish may be able to move into cooler areas, others face extinction due to warming waters. Species on the Great Barrier Reef are considered to be at particular risk. US government scientists have voiced their concern over recent signals that marine life is under pressure. An enormous toxic algal bloom nicknamed the “blob”, stretching from the Gulf of Alaska to the coast of Mexico, has been linked to the deaths of 30 large whales washed up on Alaskan coasts. More than 250,000 Pacific salmon have died or are dying, meanwhile, due to warm temperatures in the Columbia river. Scientists predict that up to 80% of the sockeye salmon population, which swim up the river from the ocean to spawn, could ultimately be wiped out. Warming water causes outbreaks of disease among some fish, as well as triggering problems high up the food chain by reducing the number of small prey fish. “This year is looking an awful lot like what climate-change predictions for the future look like,” said Toby Kock, a scientist at the US Geological Survey. Another government scientist, Dr John Stein, science and research director at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, said people were “having to change the way they do things right now” because of changes to the oceans, citing the decision by some US shellfish farmers to move their operations. Stein, who is based in Seattle, added that there was a “fair amount of political challenge” in talking about climate change. “On this coast you can talk about climate change, in certain parts of the country you cannot,” he said, in reference to a reported ban by the Florida governor of any reference to climate change by public officials. “We have a very diverse Congress and there are some of them that are true deniers and I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to reach them,” Stein said. “But you can talk to a broader section of Congress about severe drought and flood and they will listen.  “Sometimes you have to craft your message in a way that gets resonance.” Michael Gravitz, director of policy at the Marine Conservation Institute, a US-based nonprofit, said: “It’s likely the IPCC has done less on oceans than the general atmosphere and we hope that will change.” Gravitz said overfishing was another blight on ocean ecosystems, with just 10% of the world’s fish populations not under significant stress."

"With only a few days left in the current session of the California legislature, an aggressive political and public relations fight between the oil industry and top lawmakers over climate change legislation is moving into a final round. At stake is the passage of far-reaching environmental bills that would fundamentally alter the way the state does business and deals with planet-warming pollution – but would likely also change the way everyday Californians travel, live and consume.  The proposed laws represent a Democratic push to curb emissions and promote clean energy that specifically targets “mobile” pollution from cars and other gas-burning vehicles. Petroleum companies are warning that the lack of specific plans in the policies could lead to gas rationing, surcharges on minivans and trucks, and even government-imposed fines on driving habits, monitored via a vehicle’s onboard computer – big brother in the passenger seat. Democratic leaders are calling these warnings “doomsday scenarios” that won’t happen. One of the two main bills, SB 350, calls for a 50% reduction in petroleum use by vehicles by 2030, the equivalent of removing 36m cars and trucks from the road. It also calls for 50% of the state’s electricity supply to be derived from renewable resources by that date, and 50% better energy efficiency in buildings through retrofits and upgrades. The other cornerstone of the push is SB 32, which continues cap-and-trade emissions requirements for large industrial polluters like oil refineries and power companies, implemented in California’s groundbreaking 2006 climate change law. SB 32 increases those pollution reduction goals – specifically from man-made greenhouse gases, requiring the state to reduce emissions to 40% below its 1990 levels by 2030, and then increasing that to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The bills, say Kevin de Leon, the leader of the state senate, are necessary not just for the environment, but to protect the state’s population and economy for future generations. “This is a fight worth having because it’s a fight for our children’s health, it’s a fight for the economic future of the greatest state in the country,” he said at a recent press conference, also highlighting California’s longstanding role as a leader in policy making. “It is not hyperbole and it is not over dramatization to say the world is watching very closely.” But speaking for oil companies, Beth Miller, spokeswoman for the California Drivers Alliance (CDA), an advocacy group formed by the Western States Petroleum Association – a trade organization representing petroleum companies including Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobile, chastised: “The bill contains no details on how this state will achieve those kinds of mandates.”  She warns that regulatory agencies could have the “authority to do things like restrict driving, when you can drive, on what days you can drive … put in penalties for people who drive minivans or SUVs.” Without details laid out in the legislation, “all of these are within the realm of possibility”, she says. To push this dire message, CDA launched a massive media campaign with television and radio ads as well as direct mail pieces in recent weeks aimed at convincing average citizens the impacts of SB 350 will make their lives harder. It’s a tactic that supporters of the climate change measures call fear mongering, but which has resonated with many, especially those in the business community who worry about rising fuel prices. On the legislative front, the Western States Petroleum Association and allies are targeting moderate Democrats in the state assembly, lobbying them to question if the measures provide proper oversight, would negatively impact business in California, and unfairly target a single industry. “We would prefer that petroleum be taken completely out of SB 350,” said Miller. De Leon and other supporters of the bills are hitting back hard with their own barrage of media events and one-on-one meetings with their legislative colleagues. This week alone, De Leon has unveiled statements of support from former legislative leaders, a long list of business supporters including a Silicon Valley trade group that includes companies like Google and Apple, a well-known climate change scientist and US senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. State senator Fran Pavley, a close ally of De Leon, promised that the efforts to pass SB 32 and SB 350 were far from over. Democratic leaders are planning on increasing the push to keep their moderate fellows on track in the days leading up to a full vote of the assembly, which could come as soon as next Tuesday. And they are continuing to roll out more hits in the slew of media events to counter the oil industry narrative. Their message is simple: don’t believe the hype. “No one is going to outlaw SUVs, no is going to outlaw minivans,” says de Leon. “There is going to be no rationing of gas a la Mad Max … Those doomsday scenarios are not going to exist.” But the clock is counting down – the last day of the legislative session is September 11. And as of now, the votes to pass the measures in the Assembly likely are not secured. And there’s more at stake than the climate. California 77-year-old governor Jerry Brown, who is the state’s longest-serving leader (he was also governor from 1975 to 1983 and was elected again in 2011) has made climate change a major component of his legacy. De Leon is finishing up his freshman year as Senate pro Tempore, and a win on this contentious issue would affirm his ability to be a party leader. Both plan to head to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris this December, where 190 nations will gather to discuss a potential global agreement – and where a defeat on California’s legislation would be a political black eye for the state and its leaders. “Keep your eye on these next couple of weeks,” said another de Leon ally, Senator Mark Leno, at this week’s press conference. “It may be a bumpy ride.”"
"Another British summer, another set of fear-mongering headlines about swarms of “deadly” jellyfish set to ruin your holiday. But news that jellyfish numbers may be rising carries implications far beyond the interrupted pastimes of the sunburnt masses. Like a karmic device come to punish our planetary transgressions, jellyfish thrive on the chaos humans create. Overfishing wipes out their competitors and predators; warmer water from climate change encourages the spread of some jellies; pollution from fertilisers causes the ocean to lose its oxygen, a deprivation to which jellyfish are uniquely tolerant; coastal developments provide convenient, safe habitat for their polyps to hide. In addition, the great mixing of species transported across the world in the ballasts of ships opens up new, vulnerable ecosystems to these super-adaptors.  “They’ve got this unique life cycle where they can tolerate harsh conditions and then rapidly thrive when conditions are favourable. So when a stressor like climate change or overfishing opens up a niche for them they can really take advantage of that and rapidly proliferate,” said Lucas Brotz, a researcher at the University of British Columbia. Not all species of jelly benefit, rather there tends to be a reduction in the diversity of species and vast, homogenous masses emerge. “They can make millions and millions of copies of themselves and clone asexually. That’s when you get these massive blooms. I think that’s the secret to the success of jellyfish, the reason they’ve been around for hundreds of millions of years.” The latest flurry of “jellyfish invasion” stories was spawned by an announcement by the UK’s Marine Conservation Society (MCS) that their annual survey of UK waters for 2015 was looking like being a ‘record-breaker’. The problem is there aren’t many records to break. The MCS survey has only run for 12 years, not enough to identify a strong trend. Further confusing the issue, the MCS study relies on members of the public for its data. Citizen science is a wonderful tool but adds extra uncertainty – the society admits it cannot be sure how much of the growth is due to more jellyfish and how much is people becoming aware of their survey and reporting to it. Even so, the charity’s jellyfish expert Dr Peter Richardson said climate change and overfishing were fundamentally changing the ocean. “At the same time we seem to be witnessing increases in jellyfish around the UK. Is this an anomaly, a coincidence, or are the jellyfish telling us something?” he asked. Are these British blooms harbingers of the age of the jelly? Globally, jellyfish are little surveyed and their numbers vary wildly from year to year for reasons not entirely understood. Because of the paucity of historical records, jellyfish experts are hesitant about whether a global trend exists.  But Priscilla Licandro, a researcher at the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science, said in the few places where decent data exist, populations of jellyfish tend to be rising. “There is not very much reliable information, but from what we’ve got, at least at a regional level, there is an increase in the persistence and the occurrence,” she said. In the Mediterranean Sea, where records date back some 200 years, natural cycles of boom and bust have been replaced by a constant, large presence. “[In the Mediterranean] there have been changes in the last 15 to 20 years that haven’t been seen for two centuries,” she said. Similar increases in the northeastern Atlantic seem to support the MCS’s more anecdotal findings. The links between human activity and local jellyfish blooms are strong. In the Black Sea, invasive comb jellies dumped from the ballast of tankers have spawned deliriously and destroyed the region’s fishing industry. In the Sea of Japan, fertiliser run-off has left an oxygen-depleted sea where little other than jellies can thrive.  But aside from these regional observations, Mark Gibbons, a zoologist at the University of the Western Cape, said the evidence to support a global trend was still patchy. “Whether there is strong evidence of a global increase in jellyfish populations [now] is difficult to answer. Certainly in some coastal systems there have been increases but in others there have not – or at least the background data with which to measure change are absent or scant, so it is hard to say,” he said.  Other researchers, including Steven Haddock from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, believe the current observed rise may represent a natural cycle.  “I have a collection of headlines dating back as far as 1906, and all through the decades, the numbers that people see are ‘unprecedented’,” he said. “In my opinion... there is very little evidence for a global trend that indicates we are due for a future ocean dominated by jellies. They have been in the seas for millions of years, blooming and busting.” But scientists agree that the continued abuse of our oceans is leading us down a road where fish and other marine animals fail and jellies win.  “In all likelihood, owing to the factors that you have listed, we are going to see more jellyfish,” said Gibbons. However, said Brotz, “we don’t want to be too quick to say that jellyfish are this evil plague, or the cockroaches of the sea or anything like that. Jellyfish are these beautiful, amazing creatures that play a very important role in the ecosystem.” To vilify them would be to miss the ultimate lesson: that a future of oceans filled with swarms of gelatinous beasts will not be a jellyfish apocalypse, but a human one."

"Global warming has increased the severity of the ongoing drought in California, as part of a larger trend of human-caused climate change intensifying dry weather spells, scientists said on Thursday. Scientists predict that “enhanced drought” will continue in California throughout this century because global warming has “substantially increased” the likelihood of extreme droughts in the state.  Recent studies have looked at climate models to predict the future frequency of droughts while others have analyzed historical records to see the probability of drought. The paper published on Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, however, looks at how much of the current drought can be blamed on global warming.  Scientists looked at factors that could impact the drought, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and other factors and found that climate change intensified the drought in California between 8% and 27% in the period from 2012 to 2014.  Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbia University and the lead author of the paper, said he hoped the findings would motivate the state to continue thinking about its response to the drought with a long-term strategy. “California, I believe, has a history of when droughts end, they have a history of discontinuing their efforts to improve resiliency to future drought because those efforts are costly in the short-term,” Williams said.  But this strategy is not sustainable, according to the study. “I hope that the measures that are under way now to improve resilience to droughts don’t end as soon as it gets wet again in a few years,” Williams said.  His comments are particularly prescient as California prepares for rain from the El Niño weather phenomenon – which the National Weather Service said could be one of the strongest to ever hit the state. The storm system is known for bringing heavy rains to California, though it is not expected to have a significant impact on the drought.  A Public Policy Institute of California report released earlier this week cautioned that “it would not be prudent to count on El Niño to end the drought”. The report predicts that if the current drought continues, it will most acutely harm low-income rural communities and California’s forests and wetlands, putting the region’s biodiversity under “extreme threat”. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced on Thursday that July was the hottest month in history since record-keeping began in 1880. This came a month after scientists announced that the first half of 2015 was the hottest recorded.  Jessica Blunden, a Noaa climate scientist, said that heat records like this were “getting to be a monthly thing”."

"It is shaping up to be a bumper year for sightings of jellyfish in the UK, according to the Marine Conservation Society, with record numbers reported of ­barrel ­jellyfish, typically 40cm (16ins) in ­diameter, and the potentially dangerous jelly-like Portuguese man o’war found on beaches in Devon and Cornwall. The marine charity said 2015 was likely to be a record-breaking year for jellyfish, with more than 1,000 sightings reported by members of the public by July, ahead of the peak month of August. In 2013, there were more than 1,000 sightings; by 2014 the figure had risen to more than 1,400, and 2015 is set to exceed those figures.  The charity said the continuing rise of jellyfish in waters off the UK could no longer be ignored and more research and monitoring was needed. “Our national jellyfish survey suggests significant recent rises in the numbers of some jellyfish species in UK seas, most notably the barrel,” said Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager. “The million-dollar question is, why this is happening?”  Three-quarters of sightings have involved barrel jellyfish. “We know that our seas are changing through climate change, resulting in rising sea temperatures and increased ocean acidification, and we know our seas are also heavily fished,” Richardson said. “At the same time, we seem to be witnessing increases in jellyfish around the UK. Is this an anomaly, a coincidence, or are the jellyfish telling us something about changes in the condition of our seas?” However, huge “smacks” of jellyfish are not a new phenomenon, with blooms of the creatures appearing in the fossil record as long as 500m years ago."
"The independent Climate Change Authority has shot down key parts of Tony Abbott’s new environmental message, saying the government’s new target is not “in the middle of the pack” of similar countries but rather “at or near the bottom”, that the $600bn price tag the government attributes to Labor’s target is “wrong” and its antagonism to emissions trading schemes is also misguided.  The prime minister this week unveiled a new greenhouse gas reduction goal of reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% of 2005 levels by 2030, saying this put Australia “fairly and squarely in the middle of comparable economies.” But CCA chairman Bernie Fraser said the target put Australia “at or near the bottom of the group of countries we generally compare ourselves with”. Fraser, a former governor of the Reserve Bank, also took issue with the claim modelling done for the CCA in 2013 had shown a 40% to 60% emissions reduction by 2030 would cost $600bn. The Daily Telegraph revived the modelling this week in a front page story headlined “ALP’s $600bn carbon bill” – arguing the cost was attributable to Labor because it has said it would base its long term targets on up to date advice from the CCA and the modelling work had been done while Labor was in government. The prime minister then used the same figure as the basis of the claim Labor’s policy would “hit our economy with massive and unmanageable costs, massive increases in power prices, massive increase in the hit on families’ cost of living”. But in a statement Fraser said: “Others have wrongly claimed that the authority’s own modelling shows that the 40 to 60 target would impose very high costs – in the order of $600bn – on the economy. This is not correct.”  “The treasury modelling conducted for the authority in 2013 did not project the costs to Australia of pursuing a 40% to 60% emissions reduction target by 2030 (or any other 2030 target for that matter).” He said with the “right” policies the authority was confident “more ambitious targets than those adopted by the government can be achieved at modest costs”. Under the deal the government did with the Palmer United party to pass its Direct Action policy, the CCA has been asked to look at alternative climate policies. But Fraser says it is difficult to do that assessment while the government makes false claims about emissions trading schemes every time they are publicly mentioned. “The authority’s current work on the case for a market-based ETS for Australia is obviously occurring in a difficult environment,” he says. “While part of the minister’s terms of reference to the authority, the very idea of an ETS (and those raising the idea) are criticised by government members every time it surfaces, asserting it is a ‘tax’ (which it is not in substantial respects), which will have major economic and social consequences (which is not the experience of those countries where ETSs are prominent components of their climate policy tool kits). “Major decisions are looming as to how the inevitable costs of achieving large reductions in emissions are best funded – through, for example, expansion of the government’s Emissions Reduction Fund activities, which are financed directly from the budget, and/or through market-based mechanisms like an ETS. However this conundrum is eventually resolved, substantial shifts in much of the current thinking and rhetoric around these issues can be expected,” he says. The government modelled the economic cost of its own target. It showed the 26% target would shave between 0.2% and 0.3% from Australian GDP in 2030, but the same modelling found that – based on similar assumptions, a 35% target would cut only 0.3% to 0.5% and a 45% target would cut between 0.5% and 0.7%. (The modelling looked at the costs of doing no more after the 2020 target was reached, and of cutting by 26% by 2030, by 25% and by 45%.) The government has not yet released the modelling, but says it will do so in coming days. It had intended to abolish the CCA but could not get the support of the Senate to do so."
"With street names such as Gijzelaarsweg (Hostage Way), Politiek Gevangenenlaan (Political Prisoners’ Avenue) and Helden Plein (Heroes’ Square), the Ghent suburb of Malem is a place of highs and lows. Especially a place of lows. Malem is one of the lowest-lying areas of the province: a marshy area west of Ghent, picturesque, but inexorably embraced by the Leie (or Lys) river. It’s an embrace that increasingly resembles a stranglehold and, despite the strong foundations of the social housing built in 1952, the water climbs up into the houses. The basements are damp, walls cracked and mould patches dot the wallpaper. Renovation in 2008 has been of little help.  “I came to live here eight years ago,” said resident Josée Vlaeminck. “I reported the moisture problem in the basement then. The housing authority has not yet been to inspect.” His neighbour Sonja Devalez also shows us a number of rotten spots on the inside and outside walls. At first sight, Malem seems to be a quiet garden district where the exterior of each house gets its annual coat of white paint. But those who look closer see the empty buildings on the less-than-heroic Heroes’ Square. Where once there was a bakery and a convenience store, there is now just a solitary pharmacy. A number of ground-floor apartments and shopping areas have become uninhabitable due to the moisture. The place shows how damp interior walls can leave a mark on local life. “Just after we moved here, moisture levels stood at 77%,” said Elly Van Eeghem. “Many people thought it was a joke, but it was not.” With six other local residents, Eghem moved temporarily into a vacant building in Heroes’ Square. Together, they formed LOW, a mini neighbourhood watch.  “We think about the worst-case scenarios with an architect colleague,” she said. “For instance: what if Malem sinks further into the swamp due to a rise in the sea level? How can we save Malem? And what does the ideal district look like if we have to start rebuilding from scratch?”  Tom Balthazar, the Ghent housing officer, feared that LOW could worry residents due to the utopian content of the models and ideas. “But just by involving a piece of fictional future, we managed to draw attention to the reality of today,” said Elly Van Eeghem. “Someone from the housing authority was shocked by the moisture problems and promised to follow it up better than before. So you see that sometimes you need to exaggerate the reality in order to make things better.” The bankruptcy of the deus ex machina “Solutions do not just fall from the sky. Here the problem comes from the sky,” said Sonja Devalez. Sisters Lana and Roja Kader, who live a bit further along Heroes’ Square, said: “If there is a problem in your home, it makes little sense to call the housing authority.” It shows the fatalism that shines through in conversations with the people of Malem: “Nobody listens to us.” The housing authority WoninGent could provide little information about the moisture problems in the neighbourhood. “But do not forget that you also need to distinguish between moisture problems associated with groundwater and moisture problems resulting from the insufficient airing or heating of the house,” said Tom Balthazar, housing officer. Mould is simply a story of white, black and anything in between. Translation by David Cribb/Vinclu for VoxEurop."
"US president Barack Obama’s new policy on emissions announced earlier this month promises an “all-out climate push”. But as the incumbent US president has discovered during his term and a half, the “audacity of hope” often gives way in reality to the “mendacity of nope”.  It’s a brave initiative and is a demonstration of a second-term US president determined to lead by example. The timing of his announcement, to clean up coal-burning plants, could not be better – coming only months ahead of the crucial UN global summit on climate change to be held in Paris. At present there are no federal limits to the amount of pollutants that can be pumped into the air by coal plants in the US. The Obama administration said the initiative would cost $8bn (£5bn) but would save up to $54bn over time. Unsurprisingly, there was plenty of blowback. Obama’s opponents concentrated on claiming the new rules would push up electricity prices to unaffordable levels. Their argument is that technology and the market, rather than limits or rules, will achieve balance. It will come as no surprise that the need to tackle climate change is not in the manifesto of any of those seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Mood change Obama’s policy, plus a far more engaged attitude towards climate change by the Chinese, has led to a change of political mood in anticipation of the talks in Paris – certainly a marked improvement from the last big effort in Copenhagen in 2009 which ended in confusion and a cobbled-together deal. In all, 196 countries will come together in Paris seeking a deal that will come into effect from 2020. What will be sought is a commitment to limit emissions to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels. This time around, a silver bullet will not be sought, rather a quest for individual state commitments to come up with solutions that are fair to all, equitable and ambitious. So where does Ireland fit into this scenario? Well, it is likely that the country will have its own climate change laws in place by the time the summit takes place. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill has reached report stage in the Oireachtas and should be enacted relatively soon into the autumn session. On first glance, it would indicate that the government has put climate change at the front and centre of its priorities. But the reality is a little more prosaic than that. For one, the biggest omission is the absence of binding targets for the medium term and the long term, especially for 2050. The government has argued that it will abide by all EU targets, for 2020, 2030 and 2050, but climate change campaigners have argued Ireland should be a leader and innovator, setting an example for others. Positive elements It’s no surprise to see that all of the opposition parties and groups have latched on to this. Their amendments for the report stage of the legislation invariably hone in on targets – with most calling for specific commitments by the government to decrease emissions by 80% by 2050. That said, there are some very positive elements in the legislation, not least the establishment of an advisory group. The government so far has met its targets by default. The severity of recession helped Ireland succeed with the Kyoto targets. But the more onerous EU 2020 targets (principally a 20% reduction in emissions compared to 1990) will not be achieved, according to the latest EU commission assessment. In addition, Ireland has been talking out of both sides of its mouth a little on this issue. Our big problem is agriculture, which comprises 32% of all our emissions. The biggest factor here is beef. Simon Coveney has argued there is no point in Ireland dramatically reducing beef output to meet emission targets, only to allow in less efficient producers to fill that gap. Beef is to Ireland what coal is to the US. Some 500,000 tonnes are produced each year, 93% of which is exported. The industry is worth €1.8bn (£1.3bn), no small sum. Ireland is not an efficient agricultural producer. It has the fifth-lowest footprint in the EU but just beats the average. Coveney’s argument that agriculture should be considered an exception would carry more weight if Ireland had the lowest footprint in the EU."
"Why is it that for so long and under such extreme pressure, Australian political leaders of both dominant stripes have stood by one of the most controversial coal projects in the country’s history? The project in question is the Carmichael coal mine – a $16 billion (or so) plan for Queensland’s Galilee Basin being endlessly proposed by Indian company Adani. The man behind the project is Gautam Adani – the charming Indian billionaire and reportedly “constant companion” of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If it went ahead (it’s an increasingly big if), Carmichael would become Australia’s biggest ever coal mine exporting 60 million tonnes of the climate warming fossil fuel for decades to India, via a dedicated rail line and expanded port.  If the world does agree a deal to limit global warming to below two degrees, then one expert has said that by mid-century, the emissions from the mine and the burning of the coal could equal four per cent of world emissions. The approval for the mine hit a snag last week, when a Federal court case brought by a local conservation group found that Environment Minister Greg Hunt hadn’t reviewed the proper paperwork in relation to two endangered species (a skink and a snake). This has prompted the Abbott Government to push for a change in national environmental laws that would remove the rights of environment groups to challenge projects unless they could show they were directly impacted. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said campaigners were using the courts to “sabotage” mining projects.  Attorney-General George Brandis said “vigilante environmental groups” were trying to game the system. Other people just thought that it was a case of the rule of law doing its job, but they’re probably vigilantes too.  We know that Abbott loves coal and thinks that it is “good for humanity”. Is that why he is prepared to back a financially risky project? Is it the “10,000” jobs that government ministers say will come from the project (remembering that Adani’s own consultant has said that those numbers were vastly overblown and that Carmichael would result in less less than 1500 jobs).  Could it be the prospect of cash from coal royalties? Maybe.  Does the substantial media coverage from the mine just give the Abbott Government another opportunity to tell the public that all environmentalists are economic saboteurs who want to take away people’s jobs and come in the dead of night to steal your babies? Possibly.  But could there be another causal factor that has contributed to the way Australian politicians have forcefully backed Adani for so many years?  Could that other factor be the close relationships that the company has managed to forge at the highest levels with Australia’s political leaders? Whenever an Australian leader sets foot in India, it seems that a meeting with Gautam Adani is never more than a figurative (and sometimes literal) flight in a private jet away. There’s evidence of this going back at least as far as October 2010 and its there in the records of trade missions tabled before parliaments.  Let’s peruse together.  In October 2010, Queensland’s then Premier Anna Bligh travelled to India on a trade mission to promote the state’s bid to host the Commonwealth Games and “strengthen Queensland’s position as an ally and destination for future trade and investment in the eyes of the Indian market and nation leaders”.  A report tabled to the Queensland Parliament shows that Bligh’s first official meeting with Indian figures was with Adani, where the company’s owner Gautam Adani and his international development executive Harsh Mishra got to quiz the Premier about policies relating to rail lines, underground coal gasification and support for mining in the Galilee Basin.  Bligh also “agreed to attend the opening” of Adani’s offices in Brisbane later that month and extended an invitation for Adani to meet with its co-ordinator general when they were next in Brisbane.  After Campbell Newman won power for the Liberal National Party in Queensland, he led a trade mission to India too. While there, Newman joined former Labor Resources Minister Martin Ferguson and a 76-strong business delegation for a tour of an Adani port and a power plant, reportedly getting there on a private jet. The report on the trade mission, tabled to Parliament, shows that Mr Adani then hosted a lavish reception at his home for the entire delegation.  Judging by one freelance photographer’s images, the event was quite an affair with much handshaking all-round. The event was part of “OzFest” – Australia’s “largest cultural festival” for which Adani was a “platinum sponsor”  In 2013, the Queensland Governent was again in India for a trade mission led by then Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney and, again, the Adani company was on hand. Seeney’s delegation travelled with Adani executive Harsh Mishra to visit an Adani-owned port and power station before Seeney had a private lunch with the company.  Later that same day, Seeney met with Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi (now the Indian Prime Minister) and… Gautum Adani.  Mr Adani then hosted a private dinner with Seeney “which included Adani Group senior executives and members of Mr Adani’s family”. But it’s not only Queensland politicians who have sought out Adani company bosses while on missions to India. Former New South Wales Premier Barry O’Farrell met with Gautam Adani during a trade visit to India in December 2013.  Current NSW Premier Mike Baird also went on a trade mission to India earlier this year. You can probably guess by now the name of one Indian billionaire he met with. Gautam Adani is also a co-chair of the Australia-India CEO Forum – an initiative of the Australian High Commission. Trade minister Andrew Robb attended the last meeting in New Delhi. I don’t know if they had dinner (but if I was a betting man….)  Let me be clear.  Under current laws, politicians can meet with whomever they want and coalmining billionaires are free to wine and dine them to their heart’s content (as long as all gifts are properly disclosed).  But rides in private jets? Dinners with family? Lavish parties at private residences?  That’s a lot of very expensive shoulder rubbing. So far at least, it appears to be paying off. "

"Shrinking Alaskan glaciers served as a vivid backdrop for Barack Obama’s latest push for action on climate change in Anchorage on Monday night as he warned that the equivalent of 75 blocks of ice the size of the national mall in Washington were melting from the state every year. The president, who will visit the nearby Seward glacier on Tuesday to see its shrinkage for himself, urged international participants at the Glacier conference to act fast before it was too late to limit the impact not just on the region but the whole world. “The Arctic is at the leading edge of climate change, a leading indicator of what the entire planet faces,” warned Obama, who said new research showed 75 gigatons of ice were disappearing from Alaskan glaciers annually – each gigaton the equivalent of a block stretching from the Capitol to the Lincoln memorial and four times as high as the Washington Monument. “Climate change is no longer some far-off problem,” he added. “Climate change is already disrupting our agriculture and ecosystems, our water and food supplies, our energy and infrastructure.” Obama struck an optimistic tone about the growing global consensus around the need to limit carbon dioxide emissions. “This year in Paris has to be the year that the world finally reaches an agreement to protect the one planet that we’ve got while we still can,” he said. “This is within our power. This is a solvable problem – if we start now. “We are starting to see that enough consensus is being built internationally and within each of our own body politics that we may have the political will to get moving.” In particular the president hinted at further announcements during the remainder of his three-day trip to Alaska, which is designed to highlight the threat from carbon emissions and strengthen the domestic political case for new power station regulations. “Over the course of the coming days I intend to speak more about the particular challenges facing Alaska and the United States as an Arctic power and intend to announce new measures to address them,” he said. Nonetheless the president was greeted with environmental protests before his speech, with campaigners criticising his support for offshore oil drilling in the state."

"Tony Abbott is a climate change “villain” who is repeating the slogans used by the coal industry in the US, according to bestselling author and social activist Naomi Klein. Klein, who is heading to Australia for a series of public events, said the level of inaction on climate change in Australia was only matched by her native Canada. “In Canada I can’t tell where the oil industry ends and the government begins and in Australia the same is true when it comes to coal,” she told Guardian Australia.  “The Abbott government is repeating the talking points of the coal industry, the same stuff I heard at the Heartland Institute, that ‘coal is good for humanity’ and ‘God bless coal’. “We have elections in Canada in October and I hope we have a different government. If that happens, Australia will be isolated as a climate villain. At the moment we are giving you a run for your money.” Klein, whose latest book, This Changes Everything, argues governments have fundamentally failed to deal with the issue of climate change, said Abbott’s promotion of coalmines and the attempt to keep climate off last year’s G20 agenda “crossed a line where it’s impossible to come back from”. “One part I find particularly shocking is that Australia is very much on the frontline of climate change,” she said.  “Also, being a Pacific nation, your closest neighbours are facing a truly existential threat. So I find it even more shocking that Australia is a hotbed of climate denial.” Klein said climate change would exacerbate social problems such as racism and inequality, predicting Australia would become “meaner” as it gets hotter. “You see that in Australia where the treatment of migrants is a profound moral crisis,” she said. “It’s clear that as sea levels rise that this mean streak and open racism is going to become more extreme – climate change is an accelerant to all those other issues.” Abbott, who famously once called the science of climate change “crap”, now insists he accepts human activity is influencing the climate. Last week the government unveiled an emissions reduction target of 26-28% by 2030, based on 2005 levels, which Abbott hailed as “environmentally and economically responsible”. But several scientists have claimed the target is not consistent with a worldwide effort to avoid the internationally agreed goal of avoiding 2C of global warming from pre-industrial times. According to the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, climate change will hit Australia harder than many other countries, with a temperature increase of up to 5.1C by the end of the century if the burning of fossil fuels isn’t curbed. In this scenario sea levels would rise by up to 82cm by 2090, the number of days with severe bushfire danger would increase, snow cover would decline and droughts would become more extreme. Klein said the denial of climate science was prevalent in English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, the US and the UK because of a “colonial settler mentality”. “Countries founded on a powerful frontier mentality have this idea of limitless nature than can be endlessly extracted,” she said. “Climate change is threatening to that because there are limits and you have to respect those limits. Where that frontier narrative is strongest is where denialism is strongest.  “The rest of Europe has a keener sense of boundaries – they’ve lived against the limits of nature for longer.”"
"The view is breathtaking. Sheer cliff faces extend beneath the gondola as it glides from the Styrian town of Ramsau to the southern part of the Dachstein Massif, home to three glaciers. Upon arrival, visitors to the mountain are greeted by a green model dinosaur. The figure is meant to amuse children, but it has taken on a symbolic role too: glaciers belong to a dying breed. All three of the Dachstein’s glaciers – the Gosau, the Hallstätter and the Schladminger – have shrunk this year. The southern gondola lift first opened up the Dachstein in 1969. “Any climate change deniers should pay us a visit,” said Karl Höflehner, technical manager at Planai-Hochwurzen, the company operating the lift.  The glacier melt is in full flow under the glare of the mid-summer sun. Streams of clear water cut through the ice, thawing crystals crunch underfoot with every step. It is a natural cycle, but problems occur when summertime losses cannot be replenished in the winter. This is what is now happening to the glaciers of the Dachstein Massif. Strategic parts have been covered with white fleecing to slow down further melting. Höflehner believes the glaciers will lose half a metre in height this year. The Austrian Green party drew attention to the situation on the Dachstein Massif by organising a “no planet B” event. “With December’s UN climate talks [in Paris] now fast approaching, Austria shouldn’t come to Paris with nothing to offer. Instead we should aim to serve as a model for climate protection,” said Eva Glawischnig, the Greens’ federal spokesperson. “Glaciers are the thermometers of our planet,” said Rudi Anschober, regional environment secretary. He calls for a “globally binding” deal in Paris.  In the state of Upper Austria, scientists have been measuring the fluctuations in the size of the Hallstätter glacier since 2006. The research is funded by the state government and Energie AG, an infrastructure group, and is carried out by the Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research (IGF), part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in conjunction with Blue Sky Wetteranalysen, a weather forecaster. Their research shows a downward trend in glacier mass, but the weather dictates annual ice losses. The 2008-2009 cycle was particularly dramatic, with the glacier losing 103 centimetres in height. Michael Zemp is a glacier scientist at the University of Zürich who sees the retreat of glacier termini – a glacier’s bottom-most tip – as a “delayed and strong indicator” of climate change. He discusses the case of the Aletsch glacier, the largest and longest glacier in the Alps. It takes this glacier 50 years to respond to climatic shifts. In the unlikely event that climate change comes to an immediate halt tomorrow, the Aletsch would still shrink by two to three kilometres in response to today’s warmer climate. “The glaciers currently under observation are thinning out by between 50 centimetres to a full metre each year. That’s two to three times more than the 20th century average,” Zemp observes. The glaciers on the Dachstein correspond to this global trend. The Alps are, Zemp claims, the worst hit mountains. And in Austria the situation is more dramatic than in Switzerland because the mountains are lower. “Glaciers are the best natural indicators of climate change,” the geologist says. Forecasts predict that 90% of the ice will have disappeared by the end of the century. “In Austria this will come sooner.” Worldwide, only 37 glaciers have been continuously observed and documented by scientists for more than 30 years, Zemp claims. He is the director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service, which recently published an alarming study showing that glaciers are rapidly receding worldwide. And the trend has accelerated since the beginning of the 21st century. Data from 2,300 glaciers in 36 countries were used for the study. Some of the 47,000 data points go back to the 16th century. Even so, finding enough evidence is still tricky, Zemp told Der Standard. Many of the world’s 200,000 glaciers simply have no data. Drawings, watercolours, oil paintings, even documents from legal disputes serve as important historical records. Poles known as ablation stakes are used in glaciology to bore deep into the ice at key points on the glacier. When scientists later return to the instruments, they can identify changes in the glacier’s height. New technologies, however, mean laser scans can be taken of the glacier from an aeroplane. A specialised laser pointer outside the aeroplane is directed at the glacier and measures the time it takes for the light to be reflected back from the surface. “Using millions of light points we can assemble a 3D picture of the surface,” Zemp says. This method has opened up swathes of Switzerland and Austria to researchers. The glaciologist criticises the way research grants are given out. Monitoring – the constant observation of a phenomenon – is not regarded as innovative, which is why there is no money for glacier research. International data sharing and networking has been done on a voluntary basis. It means there is always some uncertainty about the availability and quality of the data. A glimmer of hope comes from the growth of glacial ice in other regions in the world. The termini of Norway’s glaciers are one example. In the 1990s, they grew by 100 metres at the coast. But, for Zemp, this was only a short-term phenomenon. “There was an increase in winter snow. The growth had already halted by the year 2000.” Translation: Simon Pickstone/VoxEurop "

"The fossil fuel giant BP helped spur a concerted industry push to curb EU policy support for renewable energies such as wind and solar in favour of gas, the Guardian has learned.  The European commission last year outlawed most subsidies for clean energy from 2017, and ended nationally-binding renewable targets after 2020, despite opposition from environmentalists and clean energy firms.   The policy decisions were however requested by BP, Shell, Statoil and Total, and by trade associations representing a plethora of oil and gas majors.   “It is clear that the fossil fuel companies worked strongly together to get rid of the binding renewable targets and ensure there would be no binding efficiency targets either,” Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe told the Guardian.   In October 2011, the Dutch oil and gas firm Shell first proposed that a sole greenhouse gas target take the place of policies that also supported renewables. Shell argued this would allow gas to cut coal-fired emissions, using the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) as a policy lever.  Papers obtained by the Guardian in an access to documents request show that just four weeks later, BP also asked Barroso to discuss a similar idea with Jean-François Cirelli, the president of its Eurogas trade association.  “Large-scale use of natural gas could secure immediate emissions reductions on an economic basis and Eurogas believes it could be of great shared interest and value to have the opportunity to address the policy framework necessary for such investments,” wrote Howard Chase, the head of BP’s Brussels office.   Gas could make an “indispensable contribution” to the EU’s climate aims, Chase said.   Over the next two years, documents show that Eurogas advocated for an emerging ‘single target’ consensus among oil and gas companies in Brussels meetings, missives and lobby forays.   “Targets for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency would not be beneficial,” Cirelli wrote in one broadside to Barroso in February 2013. “National subsidy schemes for renewable energy sources should converge and gradually be phased out.”  A BP spokesman told the Guardian that the firm believed in tackling climate change with carbon pricing measures, advocated in a joint letter to the UN by five fossil fuel firms in June.  “We believe action should be taken to address climate change and there is a role for oil and gas,” he said. “Using gas to displace coal in power generation is a very important step.” But BP declined to expand on how cutting renewable energy subsidies and targets could help to displace coal or address climate change.  A company statement said due to renewables’ smaller market capacity, “a switch of just 1% of total power generation from coal-fired power plants to gas-fired ones would cut emissions as much as increasing global renewable energy by 11%.” In 2013, BP’s trade association, Eurogas, was seen as “aligned to the EU climate targets and milestones and aims,” in an internal EU brief written for climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard ahead of her speech to a Eurogas conference.   At the meeting, Hedegaard said that natural gas was the ‘cleanest’ fossil fuel - although it still emitted carbon - and echoed Chase’s description of it as “an indispensable component” in Europe’s energy mix, until the 2030s at least.   Shale gas could brighten the picture further, she argued. “If best practices are used, methane emissions could be even lower than for imported gas,” Hedegaard’s speech said. “That’s why the commission is looking into developing an appropriate framework for [its] production.”  Two days later, the bosses of Europe’s 10 biggest European utilities came together as ‘the Magritte group’ to call for an end to green subsidies and more support for gas.  The CEO’s of 14 other firms, including Total, Dow, BASF and ArcelorMittal wrote a ‘single target’ pitch to Barroso. They said that the cost of renewable energy subsidies “cannot be borne by our companies,” and called for the mobilisation of “indigenous sources of shale gas” instead.  This line was reinforced in letters from the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP). Two IOGP members, Shell and Statoil also joined another lobby alliance – the One Target Coalition – with RWE, Fortum, Enel, Areva and ČEZ and made presentations to the commission arguing the same substantive position.  “The fossil fuel lobbyists were very successful – and definitely coordinated,” Trio said. “They had regular meetings among themselves, just like the utilities and energy intensive companies did.”  A failure by the commission to even propose binding renewable targets was “probably due to lobbying by the gas industry,” Trio added. Sources say that, within the commission, the industry push was aided by architects of the ETS, such as Jos Delbeke, the director-general of the commission’s climate department, who feared overlapping climate policies undermining the EU’s troubled carbon market. “Delbeke defined the 2030 preparatory materials and structured the impact assessment to make an ETS-only strategy look more attractive than a two-pronged approach with renewables and efficiency targets,” said a source close to the discussions. “He was pushing for the idea of a renewables-gas alliance.”  The idea proved popular in Brussels-based renewable energy associations where several energy firms lobbying for renewable policy curbs had taken boardroom positions in groups such as the European Wind Energy Association (Ewea) and the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (Epia).  “If they were speaking with two tongues - saying one thing to their partners and another to the commission – that shows that there continue to be some quite diverging [boardroom] interests,” one high-placed clean energy industry source said.  By the time of the final 2030 lobby battle, Ewea and Epia were both calling for a toned-down 30% binding renewable energy target, amid talk of a renewables-gas alliance, that has since evaporated. Gas emits around half as much CO2 as coal, according to the UN’s IPCC scientists, but 10 times more than utility-scale solar, and 45 times more than onshore wind energy."
"Before I reveal some chilling truths about environmental campaigners, you’d best grab your nearest cuddly toy and take refuge behind the sofa. As government ministers, conservative commentators and coal lobbyists have warned us in recent days, the greenies are coming.   Comfort toys may not be enough. Run for your fracking lives, people. The origins of this fearful outbreak of self-interested pleading came from a federal court challenge to the giant Carmichael coalmine being proposed in Queensland by the Indian mining and energy company Adani. Mining lobbyists and ministers said green groups were using the courts to “sabotage” projects because they hated people having jobs. Environment groups claimed victory.  The government now wants to change the laws so that the only groups will have the legal standing to object in cases will be those directly affected by mining projects.  In fact, as the court was later forced to point out, there was no judgment in the case – and therefore no sabotage had actually taken place.  The environment minister Greg Hunt’s approval of the mine was set aside over a technicality at the request of the government’s own solicitor. Hunt had not properly reviewed material relating to two vulnerable species – the yakka skink and the ornamental snake. So Hunt will have to go back and review those papers.  The upshot is that the approval of the proposed mine will be delayed a few weeks or months. But coal lobbyists, government ministers and conservative commentators spoke as one, describing the weaponry of the modern environmental organisation. When they go to courts to challenge projects, they don’t just rock up on bamboo bicycles with little more than hemp sandals and the hopes and dreams of dying planets. Oh no.  They go to court with actual lawyers. Real ones. The cheek of it. We were told they had also discovered a form of communication called email and these things called websites, which they had used to get people to send 14,000 objections to the Queensland government about the Carmichael mine. To add to the terror, we were also told campaigners were “sophisticated”, “well organised” and “very clever”. I’ll bet those monsters can tie their own shoelaces too. Michael Roche, the boss of the Queensland Resources Council, has been vocal about the campaign strategies of environment groups. He didn’t like the “clicktivism” style of campaigning that helped coordinate those 14,000 pieces of correspondence. Yet the national mining industry lobby group the Minerals Council used this same tactic last year when the coal industry was again coming under attack. The much-ridiculed Australians for Coal campaign encouraged people to fill in an online form that generated a reported 35,000 emails to the inboxes of Australian MPs. Roche has also been at pains to point out that the small number of legal cases brought by environmental groups were part of a “deliberate strategy” contained in a 2011 document called “Stopping the Australian Coal Export Boom” that emerged in March 2012. Roche even held up the strategy document in an interview on Lateline as though it was a smoking gun (apparently, we should be shocked that campaigners campaign, and that they have a campaign strategy, but not shocked by the various national strategies to promote coal by the industry which you would presume also exist). As the document obtained by journalists at the Australian Financial Review outlines, the motivation for the campaign to disrupt the coal industry was to prevent a “global climate tipping point”. When an industry threatens livelihoods, health, habitats and entire countries across the globe, you’d better hope the campaigners have a strategy. One of the co-authors of that 2011 strategy is the Tasmanian journalist, campaigner and author Bob Burton. I asked him why the strategy was put together and what he made of the statements from the industry and ministers. I’ll leave you with his response: What’s good for the coal industry is bad for the world. Who could sit back and let the coal industry do even more damage to our world when cleaner, safer and better alternatives exist? After Greg Hunt and Adani both admitted to the federal court that the decision approving the Carmichael mine was illegal, the approval was set aside. A reasonable industry and government would acknowledge they had made a mistake and calmly go back and follow the law. But the coal industry, behaving like the spoilt brat of Australian society, is demanding that the law be changed so that advice on how to protect endangered species can be ignored.  Ever since they were pinged by a small community group they have been jumping up and down yelling at those who pointed out the illegal behaviour. If it was a schoolyard they’d be given a time out but the federal government prefers to back the bully. As the industry becomes embroiled in ever more scandals and controversies they desperately need a diversion. It’s easy to see why. Over the last decade the fossil fuel lobby groups in Australia have spent the best part of $500m peddling denial and delay. This has imposed a terrible toll on Australia and the world: polluted air and waterways, the destruction of towns, farmlands and forests and damage to the Great Barrier Reef by everything from ship accidents to ocean acidification. The coal industry lobby groups celebrate projections of coal use that would cause global warming of between three and four degrees or more when most scientists and governments agree that the global temperature increase should be kept to 1.5 or two degrees at most."

"Desmond Tutu, Vivienne Westwood, Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky are among a group of high-profile figures who will issue a mass call to action on Thursday ahead of the UN’s crunch climate change conference in Paris in December. They call for mass mobilisation on the scale of the slavery abolition and anti-apartheid movements to trigger “a great historical shift”. Their statement, published in the book Stop Climate Crimes, reads: “We are at a crossroads. We do not want to be compelled to survive in a world that has been made barely liveable for us ... slavery and apartheid did not end because states decided to abolish them. Mass mobilisations left political leaders no other choice.” Bill McKibben, founder of environmental movement 350.org, which has launched the project with the anti-globalisation organisation Attac France, described the move as a “good first step” towards Paris.  “It’s important for everyone to know that the players at Paris aren’t just government officials and their industry sidekicks. Civil society is going to have its say, and noisily if need be. This is a good first step,” he said. There are now less than 100 days until the UN’s Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, where leaders from more than 190 countries will gather to discuss a potential new agreement on climate change. Last week the EU’s climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete warned that negotiations ahead of the conference must accelerate if any agreement is to be meaningful. Artists, journalists, scientists and academics are among the 100 signatories to the statement alongside activists Vandana Shiva, Nnimmo Bassey and Yeb Sano, the Filipino diplomat who lead a fast of hundreds at the 2013 UN climate change summit in Poland after typhoon Haiyan devastated his country. They target corporations and international trade, calling for an end to government subsidies for fossil fuels and a freeze on extraction.  “Decades of liberalisation of trade and investments have undermined the capacity of states to confront the climate crisis. At every stage powerful forces – fossil fuel corporations, agro-business companies, financial institutions, dogmatic economists, sceptics and deniers, and governments in the thrall of these interests – stand in the way or promote false solutions. Ninety companies are responsible for two-thirds of recorded greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Genuine responses to climate change threatens their power and wealth, threatens free market ideology, and threatens the structures and subsidies that support and underwrite them,” they state. The book is a collection of essays, many published for the first time. In the foreword, Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town who rose to fame for his stance against apartheid, writes: “Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time ... history proves that when human beings walk together in pursuit of a righteous cause, nothing can resist.” In an essay on how climate change is impacting Africa, the Nigerian environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey writes: “Temperature rises pose universal problems to the whole world, but more so for Africa. This is so because Africa has 50% higher temperatures than the global average ... burning Africa is what is at stake.” Elsewhere, climatologist Valérie Masson-Delmotte and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Jean Jouzel write on the current state of the science, while Pablo Solòn, former Bolivian ambassador to the UN presents a paper diagnosing the failure of the conferences.

"She’s performed for the pope, the Queen and the former president of the United States, but next week Charlotte Church will turn her attention – and her voice – to the employees of the oil giant Shell.  On Wednesday the singer-songwriter and actor will sing a “heartbreaking” song alongside a requiem outside Shell headquarters in London, as its oil exploration vessels gear up to restart drilling for oil in the Arctic. She hopes it will highlight the oil firm’s “nonsensical and exploitative” billion dollar venture under the ice cap and persuade its employees to blow the whistle on the company.  Her performance is part of a month-long protest that Greenpeace is staging, with different groups – from brass bands to bagpipes – playing the same four-piece movement every day during August to highlight Shell’s Arctic venture. The project was inspired by the string quartet on the Titanic, who continued to play as the ship went down after striking an iceberg.  Church said the campaign had struck a chord “because of how unbelievably dumb [drilling in the Arctic] is. It’s exploitative and nonsensical. The reason they can get to this oil is because the Arctic ice is already melting to a degree, but they’re going to drill more and make it worse … if there is some sort of spill they won’t be able to deal with it or clean it up.”  Greenpeace activists have been handing out copies of the music, parts of which were composed for the protest, alongside an email address employees can contact if they decide to blow the whistle on the company.       The three-year Greenpeace campaign has gathered the support of more than seven million supporters worldwide including Emma Thompson, Jude Law and Sir Paul McCartney. The song that Church hopes will move employees on Wednesday is This Bitter Earth, a piece made famous in 1960 by the blues singer Dinah Washington that Church describes as “one of the most poignant, heartfelt and heartbreaking songs I’ve ever heard”. She said she had been inspired to join the campaign after seeing “the smart piece of protest art” that was used to persuade Lego to end its partnership with the oil company.  “You can engage in debate as much as you want with these people at corporations ... but it’s not a fair playing field,” she said.  “They’ve got all the power, the money and the control, it’s a David and Goliath situation. A lot of time the best thing you can do to endeavour to change things is to win over the hearts and minds of the population.” Church hopes the performance will raise awareness of climate change, citing the future of her two children as inspiration. “We’re just exploiting the world’s natural resources which is just going to result in climate change worsening at a quicker pace. I’ve got two children and I love my kids and I love the world and I think it’s ridiculous what we’re doing. There are alternatives and different ways of doing things and we need to start as soon as possible. These aren’t unrealistic and we need to get this through to our governments and let them know we’re not happy in how they’re exploiting the world for a quick buck,” she told the Guardian. The timing of the protest is not accidental. On Monday, the Obama administration gave Shell final approval to restart drilling in the Arctic, despite its own analysis revealing a 75% chance of an oil spill if the project in the Chukchi sea continues. The oil and gas multinational says that it has the expertise and experience “to operate responsibly and be profitable at the same time” with a system that could respond to spills within 60 minutes, 24 hours a day. It is understood that Shell has already spent $7bn (£4.5bn) on the Arctic project, with industry experts saying that the company could hit on reserves of 30bn barrels – a size comparable to the biggest oil fields in the Middle East. The move by the US government prompted Hillary Clinton to break from the man she hopes to succeed as US Democratic president on the issue. “The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it’s not worth the risk of drilling,” she tweeted on Tuesday. The Arctic is a unique treasure. Given what we know, it's not worth the risk of drilling. -H Shell is now set to restart after a summer of setbacks. Although drilling began in July, it was unable to drill deep enough to find any oil because of US safety standards mandating the use of a key safety vessel, the icebreaker Fennica. Fennica was delayed in leaving the port in Oregon after Greenpeace activists hung off Portland’s bridge and staged a blockade from kayaks in the water. The melting of the Arctic sea ice is one of the most publicised impacts of climate change and has been in decline since the late 1970s, when satellite measurements began. However, an unexpected revival in 2013 prompted scientists to say that a recovery could be possible if the steady rise in global temperatures is halted.  Shell has said it does not object to the protest organised by Greenpeace and respect the group’s right to do so, but criticised it for prioritising publicity stunts over engaging in the debate about how to meet the world’s growing demand for energy. Shell said: “We believe we can play an important role in developing the Arctic’s energy resources. We choose to explore there because we have the expertise and experience to operate responsibly and be profitable at the same time.  “Many Arctic peoples and governments agree with that judgment. They support the opportunity to explore for oil and gas in their territories and those governments have awarded Shell the licenses to conduct those operations.  “The reality is that hydrocarbons will remain a major part of the world’s energy system for many years, not least because they provide the path to prosperity for many millions of people in the developing world, enabling them to enjoy living standards that the western world takes for granted.”"
"Barrack Obama has fatally undermined the message of his visit to the Arctic to highlight the dangers of climate change because his administration allowed Shell to drill there, a leading US environmentalist has said. Bill McKibben, winner of the Right Livelihood prize in 2014, sometimes referred to as an alternative Nobel, and founder of 350.org, said that Obama’s actions were a “bad contradiction”. “It is very difficult for Barrack Obama or anybody else to say, ‘look we take this completely seriously, this is the greatest problem the world’s ever faced but it’s OK to go ahead and start drilling a whole new oil field up in the Arctic.’ Those two things are at odds,” McKibben told a conference on fossil fuel divestment in Paris on Tuesday. Obama’s visit is designed to draw attention to the impact of climate change and highlight the fact that they are already happening in the Arctic. In a speech on Monday he said that world governments still had the power to get a grip on the problem at the UN climate talks in Paris in December. “This year in Paris has to be the year that the world finally reaches an agreement to protect the one planet that we’ve got while we still can,” Obama said. “This is within our power. This is a solvable problem – if we start now.” In his weekly address on Saturday, Obama acknowledged criticism of the Shell decision, saying he shared concerns about Arctic drilling. He said that his administration had ensured that the operations would be carried out “under the highest safety standards possible”. “We don’t rubber-stamp permits. We made it clear that Shell has to meet our high standards in how they conduct their operations – and it’s a testament to how rigorous we’ve applied those standards that Shell has delayed and limited its exploration off Alaska while trying to meet them,” he said. But McKibben said that “no one can really listen to what he’s saying” because he had allowed Shell to go ahead. “Those two things are at odds, especially because there was an important paper in [the journal] Nature which specifically identified the Arctic as one of the few places that absolutely had to be off limits if we are to have any hope of meeting our climate targets,” said McKibben. He tempered the broadside on the president by saying that Obama had made good moves on mitigating climate change.  But he said the contradiction demonstrated the power of the fossil fuel industry. “The reason that Obama said ‘go ahead’ is because everybody’s deathly scared when the richest industry on the planet takes you on.” At the international divestment conference, the European Green party, the Greens/European Free Alliance and 350.org launched the Divest for Paris challenge to encourage organisations to join the rapidly growing fossil fuel divestment movement. Over 220 organisations including universities, insurance companies, religious groups and foundations have pledged to move their investments out of fossil fuel companies. “The European parliament has formed a cross-party group working on the carbon bubble and divestment while the European Central Bank is looking into the risks of a carbon bubble.  “Unfortunately, however, the European commission seems to be dragging its feet. This divestment conference is therefore also a call to them: don’t be behind the curve. There is no future for fossil fuels – or there is no future,” says Reinhard Bütikofer, member of parliament and co-chair of the European Green party. Yannick Jadot, MEP for the Greens said: “Citizens, employees, municipalities, reasonable politicians, all of society can take action to ensure our money doesn’t destroy the climate. This is a real revolution in the fight against climate change, where finance and ecology finally meet.” The Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign is highlighting the divestment movement and has called on the world’s two largest medical charities, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust, to move their investments from fossil fuels.

"Bill Shorten will “axe” Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund if he wins next year’s federal election, gaining budget savings of up to $4.3bn over a decade. Shorten will promise to honour contracts already signed with polluters by the Coalition but will then abandon the scheme, which he describes as “a waste of money built on one counter-productive idea: giving great wads of taxpayer cash to big polluters to keep polluting”.  The emissions reduction fund (ERF) offers government funds to companies or organisations willing to reduce carbon pollution through a competitive grants scheme. It was allocated $2.5bn up to 2020 and the Coalition announced this week it would continue to get about $200m a year between 2020 and 2030. Shorten will use a speech at the University of NSW on Friday to make the pledge to end the ERF, pointing to recent research by the Reputex consulting firm which found the government’s policy would still see emissions rise 20% over the next decade, despite almost $5bn in government spending, and Malcolm Turnbull’s often-cited quote from 2010 that Direct Action in the long term was “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”. Shorten will say: “There is a better, cheaper, faster and more efficient way for Australia to tackle climate change”, naming his own “goal” of reaching 50% renewable energy, but without announcing any detailed alternative policy. Shorten has also not named the alternative long-term emission reduction target that Labor would support, after Tony Abbott announced this week the Coalition will pledge to reduce Australia’s emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030. The Labor leader described the government’s target as “sub-prime” and said that “without an emissions trading scheme, without renewable energy, without modernising our overall energy sector – it doesn’t matter what number the government picks – they won’t get there.” He also directly addresses the government’s jibe that he is “electricity Bill” based on the claim that his promise to have some kind of emissions trading scheme would drive up electricity prices. “Mr Abbott’s right. This is, partly, a debate about electricity bills. He’s just on the wrong side of it,” Shorten’s speech notes say, citing the dramatic uptake and falling costs of renewable energy and storage systems and jobs created by investment in renewables. Business groups are also deeply sceptical about whether Abbott’s policy can meet his newly announced targets in its current form. But they have also pleaded with the major parties to find common policy ground and avoid the debilitating uncertainty of constantly changing policy approach, and each incoming government abolishing the policies of the previous one. Shorten’s speech also addresses the costs of not acting on climate change, including declining agricultural production, damage to the Great Barrier Reef and widespread water shortages."

"Tony Abbott’s climate “strategy” – repeated sagely in many columns since Tuesday – is to “neutralise” the “environmental” argument with his new 26% greenhouse target and then attack Labor’s policy on economic grounds. This argument is several different kinds of stupid. First the target can only “neutralise” the environmental argument if voters are silly enough to accept two things. One, that Australia has no obligation to do its fair share of the job of limiting global warming to 2 degrees. (The target is sort of in the ball-park of other developed nations’ targets, but it doesn’t represent a fair share.) And, two, that they take on trust that the Coalition’s “surprise box” of yet-to-be-announced climate policy (see graphic below) is capable of meeting the target, and delivering the environmental benefit. (Using a range of policies is probably quite sensible, but the only announced policy is the emissions reduction fund – all the others are not yet detailed, to the deep consternation of business leaders, who are calling out the policy void.) Second, the economic “attack” can only succeed if voters are silly enough to accept that the cost of the yet-to-be-announced, and therefore uncosted Coalition policy is smaller than the costs of Labor’s yet-to-be-announced and therefore also uncosted alternative. Let’s start with the government’s policy. We can’t “cost” it – as in add up the dollars needed for the various parts – because the various parts of the surprise box have not yet been detailed. But the target has been modelled. The government has not yet released the modelling, by leading economist Warwick McKibbin, but Guardian Australia has reported on it. It says the 26% target will shave 0.2% to 0.3% from GDP in 2030.  Then let’s look at the Labor policy. Oh, wait, there isn’t one. There are also no alternative targets. There’s a promise to have some sort of emissions trading scheme and a vague pledge to have 50% renewables. But there’s no detail. All those Bill Shorten press conferences in front of solar arrays and wind turbines have been long on rhetoric and devoid of policy fact. So there are no costings of Labor’s policy either.  This was obviously a problem for Abbott’s big comparative economic costings “attack”. So he made some up. Drawing on a carefully-placed story in the Daily Telegraph, which was based on publicly available modelling done by the Climate Change Authority three years ago, the government alleges Labor’s non-policy will cost $600bn, and cut 2% off GDP growth in 2030. I discuss the origins of this blown-up “scary” number in more detail here. And even if Labor did decide to back a 40% greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030 – there is much more recent modelling of that. The government’s own modelling! The same modelling that showed a 26% target would shave 0.2% or 0.3% from GDP growth also found, using the same assumptions, that a 35% target would cut 0.3% to 0.5% from GDP and a 45% target would cut 0.5% to 0.7%. That’s a quarter of what the other modelling said. Much less scary. How inconvenient. No matter, Abbott proceeded with the argument that only Labor’s yet-to-be-announced policy will come at a cost to “growth and jobs”, whereas his yet-to-be-announced policy will protect them. In the real world – rather than the sometimes entirely fictional world of political rhetoric – companies and voters would like to know exactly what policies the major parties are considering, instead of hot air comparing the unknown economic costs of two yet-to-be-announced plans."

"A key carbon offsetting scheme was so open to abuse that three quarters of its allowances lacked environmental integrity, a new report says. UN officials confirm the findings by the Stockholm Environment Institute that around 600m tonnes of carbon were wrongly emitted as a result, under the UNFCCC’s Joint Implementation (JI) scheme.  An estimated 80% of JI projects were of low environmental quality, according to the paper, parts of which were published on Monday in Nature Climate Change. “Many of them didn’t observe the requirements of JI on ‘additionality’ as they would probably have happened anyway, and I would even doubt the physical existence of some of these projects,” said Vladyslav Zhezherin, one of the report’s authors. “I would say that many of them were fake.” A senior UN official speaking on condition of anonymity told the Guardian that the new report was “thoroughly researched and probably correct.”  JI had been beset by “significant criminal energy” in Russia and Ukraine, after the EU banned the trading of credits from an industrial gas scam on the Emissions Trading System (ETS) from April 2013, he explained. This led to a flood of what he called “almost completely bogus” credits in 2012.  “It was an outstretched middle finger to the EU saying ‘You’re shutting out our credits, we’re flooding your markets,’ a mix of retaliation and crime,” he said. Another source with regulatory experience in Ukraine’s JI market told the Guardian that, as the 2000s dragged on, JI increasingly came to be seen by market participants there as “a corruption mechanism.” “The approval of projects stopped depending on their quality but rather on connections and side payments,” he said. To gain official approval for registration under the JI scheme, Ukrainian market participants often had to transfer ERUs to a limited number of intermediary companies in Switzerland, the source alleged. Russia and Ukraine were the two biggest beneficiaries of the JI system, which allowed them to trade emissions reductions units (ERUs) ‘proving’ that carbon cuts had been made, for assigned amount units (AAUs) from rich world polluters, in the exotic lexicon of carbon trading. But under the scheme’s ‘Track 1’ – which covered around 97% of projects – states only needed to verify reductions between themselves, without any UNFCCC oversight. The eastern countries had been over-supplied with credits after the fall of the Soviet Union – but before its subsequent industrial collapse. They were also smarting at the withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol of their presumed main buyer, the USA. A decision to flood the EU’s carbon market with dud credits “was partly because of hurt feelings from having had no proper compensation,” the UN source said.  He added: “This is what happens if you give free resources, or install a subsidy-like mechanism without proper oversight in failing states, or countries with significant corrupt structures.” The issue may well be discussed at climate talks in Paris, where the EU is pushing for oversight of future market-based mechanisms to be take out of the UNFCCC’s hands.  The UN body is believed to prefer a reformed version of the scheme’s ‘Track 2’, for which it has oversight. Anja Kollmuss, another of the study’s authors, said the implications of the story for the EU emissions trading system (ETS) would be profound. “Almost two-thirds of JI credits were used in the ETS, so the poor overall quality of JI projects may have undermined the EU’s emission reduction target by some 400 million tonnes of CO2, about a third of the reductions required by the ETS from 2013 to 2020,” she said.  More than a quarter of JI carbon credits went to projects to staunch the spontaneous ignition of coal piles, mostly in Ukraine. The country’s estimate that such waste piles produced roughly 30% of its coal was “highly unrealistic” and probably led to substantial over-crediting, the report says. The report found that only one of the six major project types in the JI system reduced emissions by more than would have happened anyway. This covered N20 abatement from nitric acid production, and was also the only project-type correctly supplied with ERUs. JI is one of the three carbon offsetting schemes accredited by the Kyoto protocol – along with emissions trading and the clean development mechanism. It allowed some 872m ERUs to be issued by ex-Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries, accounting for around a third of UN-accredited emissions allowances. "

"  Barack Obama will use a trek across Alaska’s melting glaciers and permafrost to showcase the fight against climate change during a three-day visit to the state starting on Monday.  But the president, who departed for Anchorage in Air Force One on Monday morning, was accused of damaging his own environmental legacy – and the effort to keep warming below the internationally agreed goal of 2 degrees celsius – by allowing Shell to hunt for oil in Arctic waters. “Indigenous peoples of Alaska have seen alarming impacts from climate change already, and Shell’s drilling will only make them worse,” Faith Gemmill of RedOil, said in a statement, ahead of demonstrations against Shell drilling in Anchorage. Coastal erosion and rising rates of wildfire were threatening native communities across the state, she said. “We are in climate crisis here, and advancing energy extraction within our ancestral territories would seriously exacerbate climate change and threaten our ability to survive in the Arctic.” The visit to Alaska is the most ambitious by any sitting US president – a scale underlined by Obama’s decision to rename the continent’s tallest peak Mount Denali, which means Great One in the native Athabaskan language. Obama’s journey across Alaska will see him hone his wilderness skills with former special forces survival expert Bear Grylls for the NBC show Running Wild with Bear Grylls and visit a melting glacier, a famed salmon run, and a community losing ground to thawing permafrost and coastal erosion, and will showcase the real-time effects of climate change in the polar regions. However, the president ran into further criticism from native Alaskan and environmental campaign groups on Monday for allowing Shell to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea, only weeks after signing off on his ambitious plan to cut carbon polluion from power plants. “No president has done or said more about the threat of climate change than Barack Obama,” Gene Karpinski, the president of the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. “That is why we remain deeply disappointed that Shell has been allowed to begin drilling in the Arctic Ocean this year.” Obama, in his weekly address on Saturday, insisted there was no clash between his efforts to move the economy to clean energy and his decision to allow Arctic drilling. “Even as we accelerate this transition, our economy still has to rely on oil and gas,” he said in the address. “As long as that’s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports.” He acknowledged public concerns about Shell drilling in the Arctic, and the risks of a repeat of the BP oil disaster. “We don’t rubber-stamp permits. We made it clear that Shell has to meet our high standards in how they conduct their operations – and it’s a testament to how rigorous we’ve applied those standards that Shell has delayed and limited its exploration off Alaska while trying to meet them,” he said. Obama has also taken some criticism from Republicans from changing the name of the continent’s highest peak from McKinley to Denali. John Boehner, the house speaker and an Ohioan like the late Republican president William McKinley, said he was “deeply disappointed” in the decision. Obama’s arrival in Anchorage on Monday coincides with the start in Bonn of the last set of formal negotiations ahead of a critical meeting in Paris at the end of the year intended to reach a global deal to fight climate change. The pace of those negotiations has been painfully slow. Obama, who will start his swing through Alaska by dropping in on a meeting of foreign ministers of eight Arctic countries taking place in Anchorage, hopes to inject some much-needed urgency into those talks. “This is a buildup to the Paris negotiations,” a State Department official told a conference call with reporters. “It’s sort of two purposes: to raise awareness of the American Arctic but also to show that the global issue of climate change is impacting the US.” It is hoped the Arctic meeting could also smooth over emerging tensions between the US, Russia, Canada and the other countries about competition over shipping lanes, oil and other natural resources as the ice retreats at the top of the world. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. “Alaskans are already living with its effects,” Obama said in his radio and video address on Saturday. “More frequent and extensive wildfires. Bigger storm surges as sea ice melts faster. Some of the swiftest shoreline erosion in the world – in some places, more than three feet a year.” “This is all real,” he went on. “This is happening to our fellow Americans right now.” The White House said Obama would use the visit to draw public attention to those consequences and the risks to Alaska’s tiny coastal communities, some of which could be forced to relocate because of climate change. A number have already chosen to move but have no funds to do so. But campaign groups said Obama was sabotaging his own mission by giving the go-ahead to Shell to hunt for oil. “There is a very obvious contradiction between meaningful action to address climate change and continued exploration for remote and difficult hydrocarbon resources,” said Michael LeVine, Arctic campaigner for Oceana. “Moving forward with exploiting Arctic oil and gas is inconsistent with the administration’s stated goal and meaningful action on climate change.” Credo, another campaign group, accused Obama of “self-defeating hypocrisy”. After his meeting at the Arctic conference, Obama will hike across a melting glacier in the Kenai Fjords National park and visit the rural community of Dillingham, close to Bristol Bay, site of the world’s biggest natural salmon run. The president will also visit the town of Kotzebue, which is increasingly battered by Arctic storms because of coastal erosion and the retreat of sea ice cover."
"For an outsider to understand another country’s climate policy is never easy. Australia is certainly no exception. As a European observer, the recent debate about climate action in Australia is particularly puzzling.  In the early 1990’s Australia was among the reasonably ambitious countries when it came to fighting climate change. Yes, Australia was slow to ratify the Kyoto Protocol – to put it diplomatically. However, in 2007, the then new Australian government announced it would ratify, much to the applause of the international community.  Up to the 2009 climate conference in Copenhagen Australia then engaged in a much stronger fashion in the international climate talks. Yet these last few years I have again witnessed strong elements of explicit climate scepticism in the fierce and polarised domestic Australian debate. Luckily, these days seem to be over. The impacts of climate change are already taking their toll, including in Australia. The Australian government has now sent to the UN its bid as to what Australia’s contribution to the joint global effort of addressing climate change will be. The level of ambition has not gone down very well with the international community. Only if all developed countries do their fair share of the required joint effort, can we expect developing and emerging countries to also take action. But the good news is that finally there now seems to be an unequivocal acceptance in Australian politics, from the top down, that climate change is happening and that it must be addressed urgently. Now here is the puzzling question: why on earth wait until 2017/2018 to be more specific on how Australia should address climate change? It has been six years since the climate conference in Copenhagen. It has also been four years since the world, including Australia, agreed in Durban to set Paris 2015 as the deadline for all countries to explain how they would move forward. What has Australia been doing in all these years? What are you waiting for? And what is the rationale for postponing further the reforms and actions so badly needed to cut emissions substantially?  Nobody believes delaying action diminishes the challenge. Not many believe it is a durable, economic and responsible strategy to continue to bet that the future belongs to coal. China is rapidly ceasing to be an importer of seaborne thermal coal and India’s energy minister says he is confident India will stop importing coal in the “next year or two”. American coal companies have lost more than 80% of their value over the last few years. Europe is already reducing its emissions substantially and the 28 governments of the European Union have decided on target that bind us to do much more and reduce our domestic emissions by at least 40% in 2030 compared to 1990. We are using a range of tools: binding targets, a price on carbon, renewables, energy efficiency targets etc. In my country Denmark, we have created new industrial strongholds and jobs by exporting green technologies and solutions to a world that demands exactly this, only more and more. Is it easy to go low carbon? No. Change is difficult. Does it come without costs? Of course not. There is no cost-free way to transition to a low carbon economy. Some prefer to ask polluters to pay which usually means consumers buying emissions intensive goods would experience a rise in price. Others would rather ask taxpayers to financially help polluters reduce emissions. Others again prefer to give economic incentives. Or to set up tough standards. There are many ways to do this. Each country must find its own home-grown mix of solutions. But the choice is easier to make when all understand that continuing business as usual also comes with a price. In Europe, governments believe that it is better – also economically speaking – to invest in a more sustainable and low carbon future than it is to wait for the costs and consequences of climate change to mount. It seems this recognition is now prevailing also in the world’s biggest emitters like e.g. the US and China.  In short: the world is changing track. Hopefully Australia is too."

"I’m from the New Orleans area, but in 2005 was living in New York doing neighbourhood redevelopment work. I watched Katrina unfold on television, and after seeing those shocking images, I felt passionately that I needed to come home and use my training to help rebuild the city. I didn’t get to New Orleans until about a month later. My brother picked me up and we drove around the city – we saw awful devastation. His house on Jena Street in Uptown, near the Baptist hospital, was flooded. The entire first floor was ruined; mould had begun to eat the walls. The wooden floors were buckled and the smell was putrid. There was debris all over the streets, and there had been many fires in that neighbourhood.  I began volunteering doing urban planning work, and ended up working in the governor’s recovery office, putting plans together for the rebuilding of the city and surrounding communities that were impacted. I’ve been in New Orleans ever since. In November 2014, I was appointed the city’s first chief resilience officer, a role developed by the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities initiative. Today we are launching our “resilience strategy”, in the week that the city marks the 10th anniversary of Katrina. New Orleans is arguably the most vulnerable city in the US, and one of the most vulnerable cities in the world, to climate change and sea-level rise. The attention on those threats is new. I think we’ve done a very good job of rebuilding the city since Katrina, but now we need to exist in the future – that’s been the perspective shift for us. Understanding what 50 years from now looks like; rebuilding the city to withstand what it is that we’re going be faced with in 50 years’ time. For New Orleans that means looking at climate change, sea-level rise models and coastal erosion; figuring out the improvements that have to be made so we have a much more robust flooding infrastructure system. This city is just shy of 300 years old and it has always been a testing place to live, but our future challenges look very different to our past ones. We have to adapt to survive. We are a city that really needs to start to understand that we cannot engineer ourselves out of our environment. Instead of thinking that engineering solutions can solve all the problems, we need to reengineer the city to live with its environmental conditions. At its heart my job is about connecting a lot of disparate pieces. Past focus on the surge barrier and flood protection system, education and job creation has produced really well thought-out initiatives, but in many ways they’ve been isolated from one another. My role has been to connect those together and show how interdependent they are. Developing the resilience strategy has been an eight-month process, involving more than 350 individuals. We examined each of 21 challenges, from transportation and social mobility to violence and housing affordability. Three core themes emerged: “adapt to thrive” (we are a city that embraces our changing environment); “connect to opportunity” (we are an equitable city), and “transform city systems” (we are a modern and prepared city). When you talk about resilience, you’re really talking about people. New Orleanians have bounced back from adversity time and again over the history of this city, whether it be from hurricanes or the BP oil spill. So a big component of our work must be around awareness and outreach. But just having information saying “this is going to happen” is not helpful. Having the tools available for people to act is very important. For the resilient cities programme, we’ve been working with partners on building solutions that allow people to adapt – creating opportunities for the public sector, the private sector and individual citizens to take steps to prevent or mitigate against conditions we see coming. For example, incentivising property owners to invest in risk reduction schemes such as elevating their homes. We want to create a culture of environmental awareness – which also means committing to mitigating the city’s climate impact, for example by looking into setting greenhouse gas emission standards for New Orleans. The biggest economic impact in this region is from the port system. Oil spills and coastal erosion expose the vulnerability of the petroleum infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. With coastal erosion, the protection for those pipelines is going away as much as protection for the city itself. So there’s an economic point to protecting the coast as well as an environmental one. We’ve been learning from our friends in the Netherlands on how to live with water, and how we can respond to what I call a semi-aquatic environment. There’s the scientific and technical side: how do you build systems to live in these deltaic environments? But then the other side is the education and outreach component: the Dutch start with their children, teaching them how to live within this sort of environment and what it means. We need the natural systems and the engineered systems to be in balance, which is something the Dutch are pretty good at. Mainstream technological solutions that are not bespoke to New Orleans are not going to help us. We have probably more in common with Rotterdam and Amsterdam than a city like Dallas. The design standards that we build need to reflect this specific environment. The resilient cities programme has given us a stage to talk about these issues in a way that probably would not have existed before. From Rotterdam to Rome to Melbourne, it’s creating a global network of practitioners that can rely on each other to problem-solve in each other’s cities. The chief resilience officers email, text, phone – we’ve become a close-knit group. There are many, many strategies and ideas being thought about in other parts of the world that are applicable to New Orleans, and vice versa. To underline that sense of global cooperation, officers from Melbourne, Virginia and Mexico City are present today for the launch of our resilience strategy. Jeff Hebert is the executive director of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority and the city’s chief resilience officer"

"Those who reject the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming often invoke Galileo as an example of when the scientific minority overturned the majority view. In reality, climate contrarians have almost nothing in common with Galileo, whose conclusions were based on empirical scientific evidence, supported by many scientific contemporaries, and persecuted by the religious-political establishment. Nevertheless, there’s a slim chance that the 2–3% minority is correct and the 97% climate consensus is wrong. To evaluate that possibility, a new paper published in the journal of Theoretical and Applied Climatology examines a selection of contrarian climate science research and attempts to replicate their results. The idea is that accurate scientific research should be replicable, and through replication we can also identify any methodological flaws in that research. The study also seeks to answer the question, why do these contrarian papers come to a different conclusion than 97% of the climate science literature?  This new study was authored by Rasmus Benestad, myself (Dana Nuccitelli), Stephan Lewandowsky, Katharine Hayhoe, Hans Olav Hygen, Rob van Dorland, and John Cook. Benestad (who did the lion’s share of the work for this paper) created a tool using the R programming language to replicate the results and methods used in a number of frequently-referenced research papers that reject the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. In using this tool, we discovered some common themes among the contrarian research papers. Cherry picking was the most common characteristic they shared. We found that many contrarian research papers omitted important contextual information or ignored key data that did not fit the research conclusions. For example, in the discussion of a 2011 paper by Humlum et al. in our supplementary material, we note, The core of the analysis carried out by [Humlum et al.] involved wavelet-based curve-fitting, with a vague idea that the moon and solar cycles somehow can affect the Earth’s climate. The most severe problem with the paper, however, was that it had discarded a large fraction of data for the Holocene which did not fit their claims. When we tried to reproduce their model of the lunar and solar influence on the climate, we found that the model only simulated their temperature data reasonably accurately for the 4,000-year period they considered. However, for the 6,000 years’ worth of earlier data they threw out, their model couldn’t reproduce the temperature changes. The authors argued that their model could be used to forecast future climate changes, but there’s no reason to trust a model forecast if it can’t accurately reproduce the past. We found that the ‘curve fitting’ approach also used in the Humlum paper is another common theme in contrarian climate research. ‘Curve fitting’ describes taking several different variables, usually with regular cycles, and stretching them out until the combination fits a given curve (in this case, temperature data). It’s a practice I discuss in my book, about which mathematician John von Neumann once said, With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk. Good modeling will constrain the possible values of the parameters being used so that they reflect known physics, but bad ‘curve fitting’ doesn’t limit itself to physical realities. For example, we discuss research by Nicola Scafetta and Craig Loehle, who often publish papers trying to blame global warming on the orbital cycles of Jupiter and Saturn. This particular argument also displays a clear lack of plausible physics, which was another common theme we identified among contrarian climate research. In another example, Ferenc Miskolczi argued in 2007 and 2010 papers that the greenhouse effect has become saturated, but as I also discuss in my book, the ‘saturated greenhouse effect’ myth was debunked in the early 20th century. As we note in the supplementary material to our paper, Miskolczi left out some important known physics in order to revive this century-old myth. This represents just a small sampling of the contrarian studies and flawed methodologies that we identified in our paper; we examined 38 papers in all. As we note, the same replication approach could be applied to papers that are consistent with the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and undoubtedly some methodological errors would be uncovered. However, these types of flaws were the norm, not the exception, among the contrarian papers that we examined. As lead author Rasmus Benestad wrote, we specifically chose a targeted selection to find out why they got different answers, and the easiest way to do so was to select the most visible contrarian papers ... Our hypothesis was that the chosen contrarian paper was valid, and our approach was to try to falsify this hypothesis by repeating the work with a critical eye. If we could find flaws or weaknesses, then we would be able to explain why the results were different from the mainstream. Otherwise, the differences would be a result of genuine uncertainty.  After all this, the conclusions were surprisingly unsurprising in my mind. The replication revealed a wide range of types of errors, shortcomings, and flaws involving both statistics and physics. You may have noticed another characteristic of contrarian climate research – there is no cohesive, consistent alternative theory to human-caused global warming. Some blame global warming on the sun, others on orbital cycles of other planets, others on ocean cycles, and so on. There is a 97% expert consensus on a cohesive theory that’s overwhelmingly supported by the scientific evidence, but the 2–3% of papers that reject that consensus are all over the map, even contradicting each other. The one thing they seem to have in common is methodological flaws like cherry picking, curve fitting, ignoring inconvenient data, and disregarding known physics. If any of the contrarians were a modern-day Galileo, he would present a theory that’s supported by the scientific evidence and that’s not based on methodological errors. Such a sound theory would convince scientific experts, and a consensus would begin to form. Instead, as our paper shows, the contrarians have presented a variety of contradictory alternatives based on methodological flaws, which therefore have failed to convince scientific experts. Human-caused global warming is the only exception. It’s based on overwhelming, consistent scientific evidence and has therefore convinced over 97% of scientific experts that it’s correct."

"The eminent climate economist Nicholas Stern has condemned the counterposing of economic growth with climate action as a false and diversionary tactic that could damage prospects for agreement at the Paris climate talks in December. Several business groups have complained about the costs of climate mitigation and Andrzej Duda, the Polish prime minister, recently said that EU plans for ambitious emissions cuts would be costly and “bad for Poland”.  But speaking to an audience of ambassadors in Paris, Professor Stern, the chair of the Grantham research institute on climate change and the environment, said that it was a false dichotomy to posit growth against climate action.  “To portray them as in conflict is to misunderstand economic development and the opportunities that we now have to move to the low-carbon economy,” he said. “To pretend otherwise is diversionary and indeed creates an ‘artificial horse race’ which can cause real damage to the prospects for agreement.” Green parties in Europe have often argued that decarbonisation requires an end to the model of economic growth “at all costs”. But Stern said that there was now “much greater understanding of how economic growth and climate responsibility can come together and, indeed, how their complementarity can help drive both forward”. This would only grow as fears of climate dithering merged with concerns about the global economy, he said.  “There is a great danger of high-carbon lock-in,” Stern warned.  The International Energy Agency has previously cautioned that the world’s 2C target for global warming could be scuppered by the construction today of high-emitting factories, power plants and infrastructure that will chug out carbon for decades to come.  In Poland though, candidates are scrapping for votes ahead of an election that the incumbent Civic Platform party looks set to lose, and a high-carbon lock-out has been the more animating fear.  “Compared to the rest of Europe, we have enormous coal reserves and, simply understood, decarbonisation is completely not in our interest,” Duda said earlier this week. He also suggested that the country might abandon the EU’s climate goals if they were not reciprocated in Paris.  Last year, the EU unanimously committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 40% of the 1990 levels within 15 years. "
"Bill Gates called for more funds to help the world’s poorest farmers deal with climate change on Tuesday, in an appeal that could help pry open the coffers of industrialised countries. The call from the tech billionaire and world’s biggest philanthropist to focus on the poor could spur more finance from industrialised countries to small-scale farmers during negotiations for a global deal to fight climate change in Paris at the end of the year.  The focus on the poor was also in line with the Pope, who in a sweeping pastoral letter in June connected poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. In a post on his GatesNote blog, Gates said it was critical to protect small farmers in the world’s poorest countries – because they produce a large and growing share of the world’s food supply and because they face even greater risks because of climate change. “For the world’s poorest farmers, life is a high-wire act – without safety nets. They don’t have access to improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and other beneficial technologies, as farmers in rich countries do,” Gates writes. “Now, climate change is set to add a fresh layer of risk to their lives ... Of all the people who will suffer from climate change, they are likely to suffer the most.” Aides to Gates said the intervention was aimed at directing more climate finance to the world’s poor and on measures that could help protect small scale, growers from extreme weather and other risks expected in the decades ahead. “He is trying to make sure that that money gets spent on what he would think is the highest priority which is food vulnerability for the poorest people,” said Geoffrey Lamb, the chief economic and policy adviser to the Foundation. “It’s the people who are very vulnerable.” Those priorities according to Gates include better water management, to protect against drought; research to develop seeds that are drought and pest-resistant and do not demand as much expensive fertiliser. But it was not strictly about technology, Lamb said.  “It is an intervention to say: ‘look we are a significant player in global development supporting small scale agriculture and research and development for agriculture and Bill thinks that it is absolutely vital that if we think about a future that is hotter, drier and climate stressed that we think about the people who have very little margin between them and real crisis.”  Pumping up funds for climate finance is seen as a pre-condition for a strong climate deal. Diplomats gathered in Bonn this week for one of the last formal negotiating rounds before Paris. So far, governments have pledged only $10bn (£6bn) to a Green Climate Fund – a tiny fraction of an earlier pledge to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to help developing economies cut greenhouse gas emissions and protect their populations from climate change. The Green Climate Fund has also come under criticism for its priorities – in particular its dealings with big coal financiers.  With its $43bn endowment, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world’s largest private charity, exercising enormous influence on global development policy. The Gates Foundation said it spends about $390m on aid programmes aimed at small-scale farmers – or more than 10% of its total grants. It is also working with the Green Climate Fund to decide where to direct climate finance.  The Guardian has called on the foundation to divest from coal, oil, and gas, because the majority of fossil fuels can not be burned without trigger dangerous climate change. Gates rejects the idea of divestment, but he has said he would invest $2bn in renewable energy technologies. "
