"Seven years ago, Greg Combet, then a Labor minister, implemented a carbon price in a minority parliament, an experience so arduous it helped curtail his political career. Now, safely outside political life, he looks on with bemusement about where the climate and energy debate has washed up. On Tuesday, Combet launched a new report by the Industrial Relations Research Centre at the University of New South Wales investigating how countries such as Australia can achieve a fair transition for coal workers displaced as the economy decarbonises.  It got a bit lost in the wash of the week – let’s face it, it’s hard for substance to compete with the rolling spectacle of political dysfunction – but it’s an interesting bit of analysis funded by the CFMEU’s mining and energy division. In 2011 Combet had to fight almost everyone in the country to get the clean energy package legislated. Business was hostile. The energy sector was hostile. Barnaby Joyce was screeching apocalyptically about $100 lamb roasts. But while Combet’s experience was everyone shouting at him for doing something, we’ve now come full circle. Now, all the shouting is about the current government doing nothing. Business and energy retailers are on the frontline of increasingly frantic calls for policy certainty. The Gillard government would have killed for the conditions the Coalition has blown away over the last three years with reckless abandon. In any case, Combet ventured out this week about the future of coal. He insists the outlook is clear. If the world, and specifically Australia, is to do what is necessary to contain warming at 2C, then almost all coal-fired power will be gone by 2040. “That’s only 22 years away,” he tells Guardian Australia. “The energy companies get it. This is very much front of mind for the asset holders, and they want rational policy. They aren’t fighting it anymore. They don’t want stranded assets.” He says the energy market is going to transition “whether or not we’ve got Scott Morrison at the helm” and government owes it to people who will be materially affected in the transition to play it straight. “Workers in coal power stations need to know the truth. You really have to tell people the truth about structural change when it’s coming – you can’t be populist about it”. Earlier this year I asked the resources minister Matt Canavan whether he felt an obligation to help Australian communities face up to the inevitability of a carbon-constrained future. He responded as if I’d committed a thought crime. Labor, for its part, is putting a package of measures together. It’s likely to include a new statutory authority to oversee the transition and the programs intended to ameliorate it; specific industrial relations arrangements to ensure workers are managed through the process; and programs to drive economic diversification. Labor took a policy on coal transition to the last federal election, but it has to be re-engineered in some respects to take into account lessons learned from the closure of the Hazelwood plant, and also to reference the requirements of the reliability obligation in the national energy guarantee. Scott Morrison dumped the emissions reduction component of the Neg – it was a casualty of the Liberal leadership implosion – but Labor is likely to keep the policy with its own tweaks. A Labor Neg will have a higher emissions reduction target than the 26% proposed by Malcolm Turnbull, which will drive coal closure, but the reliability obligation (which requires retailers to provide sufficient quantities of dispatchable power to the grid) could mean that some coal persists in the system in a reserve capacity. Labor’s objective is to land the policy before the party convenes in Adelaide in mid-December for its national conference. The government’s new energy minister, Angus Taylor, is pushing in the opposite direction. Taylor is a bright bloke, with a lot of expertise in energy, which makes some of the positions he is pursuing hard to comprehend. While the science says the energy sector has to transition, and quickly, Taylor is digging in for coal. He’s signalled he wants to extend the life of existing plants and achieve new investment in generation by offering government support, including the possible indemnification of new coal-fired power from future carbon risk, which transfers the risk of these projects from private proponents to taxpayers. Taylor will also meet with the energy companies in Sydney next week to waggle his finger censoriously at them over their pricing behaviour. Now, why? Because he needs an outcome on that before voters go to the polls next year, because Morrison, in the spirit of handing on a poisoned chalice, has dubbed him the minister for getting power prices down. Power prices are high, and it would be terrific if they were lower. Ministers should stick up for the interests of consumers, that’s a given, but we also need ministers to think about interests that extend further than the next six months – something this government has become incapable of doing, which is what happens when the sum of your mistakes forces you to live minute to minute, without much care for whether anything connects to anything else, or whether things make sense. As the chairman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, investment banker and company director Steven Skala, noted this week, the transition is on in the energy market. It can’t be reversed. Business has moved. The financial markets have moved. “The question now is not one of direction, but of pace,” he said. Unlike some disruptions, which present too quickly for governments to ameliorate the effects, we can see this one coming. We are living through the first phase of it. When it comes to Australia’s 8,000 coal workers and the communities that depend on those workers spending their incomes locally, governments can either pretend they can hold back the future, indulging inane, virtue signalling with Alan Jones about “fair dinkum” power while letting real people be crunched in the transformation, or they can act to make the shift as just as possible. The report Combet launched this week warns that a hands off approach has left many retrenched workers and their communities with very difficult transition problems. “Because of lack of subsequent support, some problems – like intergenerational unemployment, poverty and poor physical and psychological health – continue and worsen with time, becoming entrenched and systemic,” it says. “These people, their families and communities have been left to carry the main costs of structural adjustment. This represents a very unfair transition.” So here’s a thought. Instead of “fair dinkum” power, perhaps we could contemplate some “fair dinkum” action?"
"Heatwaves in the UK are lasting twice as long as they did 50 years ago, ice days are disappearing and tropical nights are starting to occur as far north as Middlesbrough, according to a Met Office report. The first study of climate extremes in the UK by the government agency shows the longer-term trend behind this summer’s prolonged spell of high temperatures and the weakening of winter frosts. In line with numerous other research papers on the rise in global temperatures, it also highlights how weather patterns are being pushed off a normal path as a result of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Until now the annual UK Climate Report has focused on monthly and yearly statistics, but a new supplement adds a series of indices on extreme weather. Mark McCarthy, the manager of the National Climate Information Centre, said: “Monthly, seasonal and annual climate data provide a valuable record of the changing climate in the UK. However, these average figures have a tendency to mask extreme weather and climate events. So in our latest report we have focussed on those measures which record weather extremes.” The new report shows that warm spells – when the maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile for the time of year – are becoming much more prolonged. From 1961 to 1990, the average longest warm spell each year was 5.3 days. From 2008 to 2017 this more than doubled to 13.2 days. This year, which is not included in these statistics, was even longer at 17 days. The south-east has seen an especially striking increase over the same period, up from an average of 6.1 days to 18.3 days. Tropical nights – when minimum nighttime temperatures remain above 20C – are being measured for the first time. They were almost unheard of until a couple of decades ago. Even the famous hot summer of 1976 never saw any of these nights, which are particularly gruelling for the elderly and infirm because they provide no respite from the heat. Since 1995 they have started to be recorded in London, Kent, the Isle of Wight and even occasionally in Wales and the north-east.  McCarthy said tropical nights were still very rare but he expected them to occur more frequently in the future. “With projections in climate suggesting warmer temperatures, it is useful to have this metric in place so that future changes can be monitored.” McCarthy said he was most surprised that extremes of hot and cold were changing at different speeds. While the temperature on the hottest day of the year has risen roughly in line with the average annual rate of warming since 1961, the coldest day has warmed at twice that rate. In the 30 years until 1990, the bitterest winter night in the UK averaged -8.5C. From 2008 to 2017 it was -6.8C. Parents who walk their children to school in the depths of winter may also have noticed there is less ice on the path than during their own childhoods. This is confirmed by the metric of “icing days”, which shows that the average number of days each year with freezing temperatures has fallen from 4.8 to 3.2. In the south-east last year there was not a single day averaging below 0C. The weather is becoming a little wetter and more dreary. The maximum daily deluge each year has risen by 17% from 64mm to 75mm, while the longest wet spell has increased from an average of 12.4 days to 12.9 days. The longest dry spell has become shorter, falling from 20.5 days with less than 1mm of rain to 18 days, though this year has brought such severe droughts that many farmers have had poor harvests. Many have already had to feed their winter food stocks to their animals and face increased costs as a result. In August the government was forced to relax rules on how much groundwater farmers were allowed to use after agriculture bodies warned continued dry weather could lead to food shortages and increased prices. Last month the UN’s top climate body warned that unless global temperature rises are held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world is likely to face catastrophic impacts from climate change, with flooding, droughts and extreme heat all more prevalent. Governments will meet in Poland in December for the latest round of negotiations over how to implement and strengthen the recommendations of the 2015 Paris agreement."
"Too many polar bears are roaming the Canadian Arctic, and the growing population is posing an increasing threat to Inuit communities, according to a controversial new government report which has been bitterly contested by environmental scientists. The draft report was prepared by the Nunavut government, and consists of submissions from Inuit community groups across Canada’s northernmost territory. Public consultations are set to start on Tuesday before the government unveils the final report later in the year. “Inuit believe there are now so many bears that public safety has become a major concern,” said one section of the report, according to the Canadian Press. “Public safety concerns, combined with the effects of polar bears on other species, suggest that in many Nunavut communities, the polar bear may have exceeded the coexistence threshold.” The renewed focus on polar bears comes after a tragic summer for the region: two people were killed by bears in separate attacks, including father Aaron Gibbons, who died protecting his children. Researchers agree that polar bears represent a growing threat to Inuit communities, but say that is because climate change has pushed them closer to human settlements – not because the bear population is growing. “There seems to be a divergence between scientists and Inuit on the threat that climate change poses to this species,” said Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher at the University of Alberta. Scientists and conservation groups have warned that a warming climate has reduced sea ice and the availability of prey, pushing bears on to the mainland – and closer to humans. But Inuit argue their own observations are often ignored, and the new report highlights a growing tension between scientific research and Inuit knowledge based on from thousands of years of living in the region. “We know what we are doing, and western science and modelling has become too dominant,” wrote the Kitikmeot regional wildlife board as part of its submission to the report. “Our knowledge, is not the same as thousands of years ago. If your life depended on it, you’d better know what the ice condition is,” said Gabriel Nirlungayuk, an Inuk hunter of Rankin Inlet. “Our knowledge has always evolved.” Aerial surveys are often used by scientists to determine the population health of bears. But Nirlungayuk said that some of the best hunting conditions for polar bears are during stormy, foggy weather that grounds aircraft – when bears can sneak up closer to their prey.  The polar bear hunt remains a critical and lucrative component of life in the northern communities. Hunters can receive as much as $10,000 for pelts, with residents parcelling up and sharing the meat for food. Canada has long resisted legislation that would terminate the harvest. While Inuit and scientists disagree on the population of the bears, they both foresee problems in the future. Derocher worries bears will continue to show up in communities, drawn in by numerous attractants – putting both humans and bears in harm’s way. “We’ve been saying this for years: we’re going to have a lot more problem bears. And if we don’t get on top of it, we’re going to see a lot more issues coming down the road,” he said. Nirlungayuk agrees. “We want to enjoy being out on the land with our families. But today, people need to carry a rifle all the time just to enjoy the great outdoors.”"
"Roger Kelly had been up through the night, watching the orange glow emanating from the hillside above his home of 30 years. The Seminole Springs mobile home park, a co-op of 215 small lakeside homes tucked into the canyon between Malibu and Agoura Hills, was on the warpath of the most destructive fire to ever hit Los Angeles and Ventura counties.  By the early morning on Friday last week, flames were quickly billowing toward them. “The way the smoke was coming you just knew it was on the other side of the hill and about to jump,” he say. His wife was ready with essentials packed. “I never thought we would burn here,” he said. “So, I just grabbed my surfboard” and left many other possessions behind. But before the day was through on Friday, half the neighborhood would be gone, leveled into ash and metal, foundations and car-frames. Referred to as a “hidden gem” by those who live there, most outsiders – even southern California locals – didn’t know the Seminole Springs neighborhood existed until an aerial view of the Woolsey fire caught by a local TV helicopter showed what was left behind. Roughly 100 small homes, which had once been closely clustered together in the canyon, had been reduced to rubble. Lots of people here consider one another family. That’s why the broadcast footage haunted residents. “I probably looked at that screenshot 100 times trying to figure out [who was spared],” Kelly said. “I could see my neighbor’s house, but I couldn’t really see mine. It was killing us, my wife and I.” By Saturday the president of the park had called – his home was safe. But in a tight-knit community like this, the relief couldn’t be fully felt, as neighbors suffered. “I didn’t know my place was there for sure, until I saw it with my own eyes,” he said, explaining why he evaded blockades set by the authorities and returned to the evacuated area over the weekend. “We came over the little hill and I saw it and … I couldn’t believe it. I got so overwhelmed with emotion. Just to see all the devastation.” Most members of the mobile home park, which was built in 1969, had lived there for years, raising their families together. It was the kind of place no one wants to leave, once they snag a spot. Initially constructed as a senior community, over the last few decades Seminole had begun to welcome families with children and recently, the 215 units were filled by a mixture of old and young.  The Seminole Springs website shows brightly colored kayaks adorning the shore, trails that lead past the lake into the green hillsides overlooking the community. There’s a pool, a BBQ area, and a lounge. “It was a gem,” Kelly said. “And it will be again. We hope.” Kelly adds: “In my opinion because we are a community of 215 families and homes –and we have been here for 40 years – we should have been a priority, rather than saving the big fancy homes built way in the middle of nowhere.” The Woolsey fire, which is still burning across more than 97,620 acres near Malibu in southern California, is 47% contained after six days of an around-the-clock firefight. The Los Angeles county fire chief, Daryl Osby, said the battle against this giant blaze, which has now scorched an area larger than the city of Denver, has been the most difficult he’s seen in his 35-year career.  So far, it has consumed more than 435 structures, a number officials say is likely to rise as damage crews finish their assessments. “I feel bad that we lost any homes,” Osby told the Guardian. Though he didn’t know the specifics of the Seminole Springs fire, he said it was something he would assess in the coming months when officials study the fire’s progression. “We did the best we could,” he adds, emphasizing that their teams had to use the limited resources they had to focus on saving lives. “I think we were successful at that objective, preventing death. Unfortunately, it was at the expense of people’s homes.” Carol Ornelas’s home was perhaps the last one that burned before the fire moved past the neighborhood. She lived in one of the few decimated houses in the lower-part of the park. Her three best friends, who live in the upper-part of Seminole Springs, all lost their homes. “We all moved there to be in the same place. But now it’s unbelievable,” she said. “Usually, if something terrible happens to one of your friends you can all rally to help that person – but it is all four of us.” ﻿Now she is resting with a friend and trying not to focus on the negatives. Ornelas had just moved her 94-year-old mother into an assisted living facility, and had recently brought all her family’s keepsakes to her Seminole Springs unit. She and her husband, a drummer, also had the only photo of him playing for Sonny and Cher hanging on the wall. Nothing could be recovered from the wreckage. “They are just things,” she said, “but they are things that we absolutely can never replace. Things that are not valuable so to speak, but they are the things I wanted to have forever. That’s the worst part – losing the things you can’t replace.” Houston Waye, a new resident who moved into Seminole Springs in February, left on Thursday evening to ensure his wife, animals, and two-year-old baby were out safely, but he returned on Friday afternoon, avoiding blocked roads by hiking in through a back route. In the first scramble to get out, he’d barely brought any of his own things. “I had two dogs, a cat, a tortoise and a two-year-old,” he said. By the time he returned, most of the damage was done. But he and others worked to ensure the smoldering patches wouldn’t reignite. The homes on the edge, between the line of saved homes and burned ones, were ablaze when he arrived. Waye and a neighbor who stayed through the ordeal used hoses to put them out. “This will bring out the best in a lot of people,” their neighbor Brandon Rubin said, calling helpful residents heroes. His was one of the homes still standing, but as someone who both grew up in Seminole Springs and who returned to live there with his girlfriend, receiving the news was “one of the most bittersweet things you can imagine”, he said. “There are faces to all those homes that you see gone,” he said. “Close to 100 homes were lost. That is a lot of people in trouble. ” But, he is certain they will rebuild – and they will do it together. “Like any community it’s not perfect. But we all love each other. We are all there for each other,” he said, adding: “the stuff is gone. But we are here. We are strong people and we are going to get through it – together.”"

"The social media influencer Jack Harries has said young people have a duty to protest against environmental destruction, as he took part in a day of protest in London that led to at least 14 arrests. The 25-year-old, whose YouTube channel has 4 million subscribers, spoke to the Guardian as he helped hold a 68-metre banner over the side of Westminster Bridge with the words: “Climate change: we’re fucked”. Harries, who has made a number of films about environmental destruction, said he was willing to use his social media influence to inspire his followers to take action over the climate. He said: “As a young person growing up in London I feel scared for the state of my future [and] overwhelmed by the news about climate change, and I feel like our government is simply ignoring the problem. “It’s worth noting I don’t want to be here, but I feel that it’s my duty as a young person to make our voices heard and to force our governments to listen because, ultimately, it’s our future that’s at stake.” He added: “Climate change is a global issue and it’s up to all of us to stand up to be heard. I think we have gone past the point of turning off our lightbulbs or having shorter showers. This is an existential threat. Young people should be angry and should be demanding change from their leaders. “For far too long leaders have avoided action on climate change because they have banked on the fact that young people don’t understand. We are here today to tell them that we do understand the issues, and we are scared.” Harries spoke at the beginning of a new day of action by the Extinction Rebellion group, which is orchestrating a week of events planned to bring London to a standstill. They say they have 500 activists who have signed up to be arrested.

He said: “If we carry on like we are now, my grandchildren have no future, absolutely no future. This is the last-ditch attempt, it’s too late to try anything else.” A second protester, facing police who arrived minutes later, said: “You don’t have to waste your time with CCTV because we’re not running away and we’ve got paint on our hands.” A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said the protesters used water-based spray chalk, which washes away easily.

"On a stiflingly hot morning, Daw Mya Htay rolls up her longyi, a Burmese sarong, ready to wade into the sea. “The well used to be the centre of our village,” Mya Htay says, grasping the side of a cement water well. But it no longer holds fresh water.  For the people of Khindan, the well is symbolic of their losing battle with the sea. Ten years ago, the town noticed erosion of the beachfront. Five years later, the well was swallowed by the sea. “Because of the storm surges, my old house was destroyed. The sand deposits just fell away,” says Mya Htay. Two kilometres of the village coast have been affected by accelerated erosion. Two weeks ago, the UN jolted the world with the message that we have 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Its report urged action to cut carbon emissions to avoid the atmosphere warming by a disastrous 3C. In countries such as Myanmar, even a modest rise could be the tipping point for a new conflict over water and a new wave of climate refugees. Worldwide, Myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to extreme weather events. The effects are widespread: in the dry zone, home to nearly a third of Myanmar’s total population, temperatures are projected to rise by up to 3C after 2040. In the Irrawaddy delta, in the south – where people are still rebuilding after the country’s worst natural disaster, Cyclone Nargis, which displaced 2.4 million people – the mid-level projection for sea-level rise is up to 40cm by 2050. A sea level rise of roughly 13cm by 2020 may sound less alarming than the rate in the Republic of Kiribati, a group of Pacific islands that at risk of being totally erased this century. But climate consultant Sonia Leonard, who is working in Mon state with environmental organisation Alarm, points out that in low-lying floodplains where more than 140,000 people live, this increase will result in permanently flooded areas and a loss of productive agriculture land. People in Khindan have had to migrate from their homes several times. They have moved back as far as they can go on vacant land. “Now they’re literally just waiting for their houses to fall into the sea,” says Leonard, who is mapping vulnerable communities likely to be displaced by climate change. This year more than 150,000 people across Myanmar were displaced by flooding. What was once consistent rainfall has been replaced by a more intense monsoon, causing flash-flooding. “We feel like hermit crabs, we do not have a place to live,” says Khin Ohn Myint, her voice wavering as she looks at the bones of her house in the sea. What’s most striking is that this year has been par for the course in terms of abnormal monsoon periods and natural disasters.  “If this is just a normal year, with a large storm surge that has been slowly intensifying each year, what happens when a big cyclone hits again?” asks Leonard. In Khindan, the population visible on the streets consists mostly of elderly people and young children. Village elder Aung Shein’s situation is typical: “My children have had to go across the border [into Thailand] to look for work, so we are looking after their children,” he says. As people lose their land, experience a drop in crop productivity and struggle with declining water availability, many in Myanmar’s rural or coastal areas are migrating to the cities. Outmigration is also high, with more than 4 million Myanmar migrants working in Thailand alone. The new government has started to provide financial aid of 20,000 kyat (£9.65) for each household affected by natural disasters, but even officials concede this isn’t much for people who lose their houses or land.  Shashank Mishra of the Myanmar Climate Change Alliance believes access to water could spark conflict in the future. He points to the dry zone, where people have already been forced to leave their homes due to lack of water or an increase in temperature. “The total monsoon period has already decreased from 144 days per year in 1998 to 125 days,” Mishra explains. The number of extremely hot days is projected to increase from one day a month to between four and 17 by 2041, adds Mishra, which will also cause serious health problems. Ten years after Cyclone Nargis, some villages have received new cement tanks to hold fresh water, but there remains a pressing need for better adaptation planning. Leaning over a map of the Irrawaddy delta, field officer Win Naing explains: “We have built two storm shelters here in these central villages, and we are trying to build more mangroves to shelter village coastlines.” But if another intense cyclone hits – and since the 80s, cyclones in the Bay of Bengal have increased in number, often developing into hurricane-force storms – taking shelter in a multipurpose shelter may not be enough. One expert who has worked in Bangladesh advocates a “land bank”, for the government to earmark vacant land that can be allocated to future climate-displaced people. Setting aside parcels of land, which vulnerable communities can move, to is a concrete solution in a rights-based approach that aims to prevent land conflict. Scott Leckie of Displacement Solutions in Australia warns: “In most places in the developing world they [climate migrants] will end up landless, migrating from rural areas and ending up in slums in the cities with severe increased poverty, if there is no assistance.” U Hla Maung Thein, from the environment and conservation ministry, says the government is trying to work towards the goals set in the Paris agreement. “We have initiated plans such as a fish adaptation project, and for a community forest in Hinthada in the Ayeyarwady division and Chauk in the Magway region.” Climate activists welcome the government’s pledges, but say implementation must be quicker.  Back in Khindan, Daw Mya Htay gives her grandson a push on his bike while discussing climate change. She sighs. “It would be convenient if there was no sea level rise,” she says. Then, turning back to her house she shrugs. “But if it does, where will we go?”"
"Vital roads, bridges, rail lines and hospitals in the Glasgow area are at significant risk of being damaged or closed by climate change, a major study has found. The study, thought to be the most in-depth carried out for any city region in the UK, said that by 2050 the area will be hit by far more powerful storms, by regular heatwaves and by heavy winter flooding, affecting up to 1.8 million people. That could see hospitals struggling to cope with abnormal temperatures or flooding, long stretches of motorway closed by floods, the West Highland line at risk of closure from coastal erosion and bridges at greater risk from gale-force winds. The review by Climate Ready Clyde, a coalition of six councils, transport agencies, universities and government agencies, covers an area of about 3,400 km2 (1,300 sq miles) and includes major towns such as Hamilton, Motherwell, East Kilbride and Paisley. It was published on Wednesday to mark UN World Cities day. With findings likely to be replicated across the UK, it has warned that failing to adapt and prepare for climate change could cost the Glasgow region several hundred million pounds a year by the 2050s from storm, flooding and heatwave impacts. In a new five-year plan for the region, the group will recommend including better physical and natural flood defences, more air conditioning and ventilation systems, greater tree cover and greater use of green roofs, and wind barriers on bridges. Some councils could seek new powers to issue their own bonds, to raise money from investors to cover the extra costs. If coastal erosion accelerates, several hundred metres of the West Highland line to Fort William will be threatened by the sea along the north Clyde coastline near Ardmore Point, Cardross and Dumbarton. Long stretches of coast have already been eroded significantly. Other sites most at risk include: • the Erskine bridge over the Clyde, which carries 38,000 cars a day, will see “extreme exposure” to stronger gales and could require costly wind barriers • the M74 motorway near Hamilton and the M8 in central Glasgow, used by 97,000 cars a day, is at high risk of flooding • the Royal Alexandra teaching hospital in Paisley is at high risk of surface water flooding and medium to high risk of river flooding • the poorest neighbourhoods of north and east Glasgow are the most vulnerable to the economic and social impacts of heatwaves and flooding Kit England, project manager at Climate Ready Clyde, said the NHS, Transport Scotland, Network Rail and local councils are carrying out more detailed studies to make sure they could forecast risks to their buildings and infrastructure. Glasgow had a hint of the heatwaves to come last June, he said, when temperatures nearly hit 32C, the city’s hottest day on record. A waterproofing membrane lining the roof of the Glasgow science centre melted, while suburban rail lines closed after rails buckled and signalling systems failed. Warning that the poorest citizens are likely to be the worst affected, its assessment assumes that world governments will fail to meet the target to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C recommended earlier this month by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It has reviewed two scenarios where the world warms by 2C and 4C. Climate scientists forecast that the chances of Glasgow experiencing a summer heatwave by the 2050s will be one in three, compared to 1 in 30 for Aberdeen. Winter rainfall could increase by 50% by the 2080s while sea levels in the Firth of Clyde are forecast to rise by nearly half a metre by the 2080s. James Curran, the former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, who chairs Climate Ready Clyde, said warming is already influencing today’s weather patterns. “We know climate change is with us and there is no natural weather left in the world,” he said. “We have to start adapting for it as well as continuing to press the urgent case for reducing carbon emissions and promoting carbon sequestration and so on.” Curran said weather-proofing urban areas would also provide business opportunities and an economic stimulus, offsetting the costs of climate adaptation. The challenge was ensuring all levels of government, transport bodies and businesses collaborated effectively and at a regional level. Network Rail said it spent some £25m a year in Scotland on earthworks and drainage, but added it would need see dramatic changes to the north Clyde coastline before doing work to specially protect the West Highland line."
"Half of the increase in Australia’s annual carbon dioxide emissions can be linked to a single issue: the failure to bury greenhouse gases underground at the country’s largest liquefied natural gas development. Chevron’s Gorgon LNG development in the Pilbara is considered a landmark development in carbon capture and storage, a long-promised technology to limit emissions from fossil fuels. Under its agreement with the Western Australian government, the energy giant is required to capture 80% of emissions from an underwater gas field over a five-year period and inject them into a reservoir 2km under Barrow Island. The Minerals Council of Australia chief executive, Tania Constable, last month told ABC the project demonstrated that carbon capture and storage was “coming through very strongly”. But nearly two years after the start of LNG production from the Gorgon gas field, emissions storage is yet to begin. A Chevron spokeswoman said technical issues were identified in the commissioning of the storage project and modifications were under way. She said it was expected underground injection would begin by March. The company said between 3.4m and 4m tonnes of carbon dioxide would be buried each year. It was estimated it would cut Gorgon’s total emissions – counting both fugitive emissions from gas wells and those released during production, when the gas is compressed into liquid form for export – by about 40%. The $2.5bn project is backed by $60m in federal government funding. A new report has questioned whether the company expects the project to work. The analysis by research group the Australia Institute said Chevron has also applied – and been granted approval – to emit an average of 8.7m tonnes a year to 2020 under the government’s “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Tony Abbott-era Direct Action climate policy. It said if the injection project does work Gorgon’s emissions would fall from between 8.5m and 10m tonnes to between 5.1m and 6m tonnes a year. The institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said by granting it a higher emissions limit the government was allowing Chevron to plan for the carbon storage project to fail. Federal government data shows increased LNG production was the main reason national emissions rose by 6.8m tonnes in the year to March. The Australia Institute report suggests the delay at Gorgon’s carbon injection project played a central role, causing emissions equal to half that increase. “Rather than holding Chevron to account, the Morrison government is giving it as much leniency as it possibly can,” Merzian said. “It’s another example of the government’s inaction on climate change. If the government isn’t going to address LNG emissions, which is one of Australia’s fastest-growing sectors, then Australia has no hope of meeting its Paris target.” LNG production in Australia has tripled since 2012, doubled in the two years to 2017 and is expected to grow another 18% this year. The related growth in emissions is projected to effectively wipe out carbon pollution avoided through the 23% renewable energy target. The LNG industry is covered by the safeguard mechanism, which grants big industrial sites generous pollution limits, known as baselines. The baseline at Gorgon is drawn from Chevron’s projections of how much will be emitted in its biggest production year in the first five years of operation. The company can emit up to that baseline for free, but will have to buy carbon credits to offset any emissions above it. The baseline is expressed as 25m  tonnes over the three years to June 2020. Merzian said the mechanism was next to useless while companies could nominate their own baseline. “It’s like allowing a taxpayer to nominate how much tax they want to pay,” he said. Based on the cost of carbon credits under the government’s emissions reduction fund, Merzian estimates it would cost Chevron up to $52m a year if it was required to offset the pollution it had agreed to sequester but that is currently being released into the atmosphere. Neither Chevron nor the federal environment minister, Melissa Price, answered directly when asked if Gorgon’s baseline implied the carbon storage project would not work. A Chevron spokeswoman said the company had applied for a baseline in accordance with strict regulations overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator, a government agency. A spokesman for Price said the baseline was calculated based on an audited forecast of emissions intensity and production at full capacity. “Businesses must manage their emissions and keep to [their] limit,” he said. Price’s spokesman said LNG exports played a role in international emissions reduction efforts by providing a relatively low-emitting fuel source for electricity. In WA, the Environment Protection Authority is investigating the agreement between the state and the company in light of the delay, including when the five-year period in which it has to bury 80% of fugitive emissions officially started. After a tour of the Gorgon site in October, state environment minister, Stephen Dawson, was quoted in the West Australian saying he would give the company the “benefit of the doubt” that it would overcome the technical issues the storage project was facing. The EPA is expected to report back by April. Dawson said it should be clear by then if the carbon injection project would work and whether Chevron could meet the target. “Discussions will then need to commence on how Chevron can offset the portion not able to be sequestered,” he said."
"I am saddened by the overwhelmingly one-sided criticism of David Attenborough’s alleged failure to address environmental issues in his nature programmes (Letters, 12 November). Like many teachers I have used Attenborough’s wonderful productions to enthuse my pupils with a love of science and a deep appreciation of our living planet. No living person has educated more children and adults than he. And with education comes the knowledge and understanding necessary to debate the survival of life on Earth calmly and rationally. One of Attenborough’s great strengths is his refusal to be evangelical or politically correct (there are enough of those about). He talks the language of Darwin and evolution but doesn’t preach atheism or secularism. He has shown us virtually every ecosystem on the planet but, having armed us with the knowledge, leaves it up to us, and especially the environmentalists, what to do with it. Stan LabovitchWindsor  • I agree with much of what George Monbiot has to say, but I found his criticism of David Attenborough harsh and unjustified (Attenborough has betrayed the living world he loves, 7 November). Attenborough’s much-acclaimed wildlife programmes can have left most viewers in little doubt about his deep concerns over the damage being done to the environment, and made a significant contribution to public awareness of the problems. Some years ago, I happened to be at the north pole base camp for expeditions and other activities at the same time as the Frozen Planet team. I was struck by the care and time they were taking to find the right conditions for Attenborough to stand at the pole in order to do a piece to camera expressing his worries about global warming. This was not somebody trying to brush the issue under the carpet.

"Looming climate breakdown is opening fresh divisions among environmentalists over nuclear energy, with a major advocacy group calling for struggling nuclear plants to be propped up to avoid losing their low-carbon power. Nuclear is the single largest source of low-carbon electricity in the US. But a third of nuclear plants are unprofitable or scheduled to close, risking a rise in greenhouse gas emissions if they are replaced by coal or natural gas, a major Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report has found. US emissions could increase by as much as 6% if struggling plants are shuttered early, the report warns. This scenario has put pressure on many environmental groups to re-evaluate their intrinsic opposition to nuclear energy as a dangerous blight that must be eradicated. “We are running out of time to make the emissions reductions needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research for the UCS climate and energy program. “Losing a low-carbon source of electricity like nuclear power is going to make decarbonization even harder than it already is. Nuclear has risks, it’s not a perfect technology, but there have to be trade-offs.” The US, like the rest of the world, faces a steep challenge to avoid the worst ravages of heatwaves, drought, extreme weather and flooding. The IPCC report states emissions must reach net zero by 2050 to avoid the most punishing climate change impacts, whereas the Trump administration is currently dismantling every major policy aimed at lowering emissions in the US. The US has an ageing fleet of nearly 100 reactors at 60 nuclear plants, with many nearing the ends of their expected lifetimes. Five plants have shut down since 2013, with a further five set to shutter over the next eight years. In total, a third of US nuclear power plants are set to close down or are unprofitable largely due to a major shift to cheaper natural gas. As nuclear provides more than half of the US’s low-carbon energy, this situation “raises serious concerns about our ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change”, the UCS report states. Replacements for nuclear will vary across the country. The huge Diablo Canyon plant in California, for example, will probably spawn a surge in renewable energy when it shuts in 2025. But in other states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, weak clean energy policies and the abundance of natural gas mean the closure of nuclear plants will probably raise emissions. “Renewables can fill a lot of the gap but it’s a timing issue,” Clemmer said. “Over a long timeframe we can ramp up renewables and phase out coal, gas and nuclear generation but we don’t have that time. We have to cut half of all emissions by 2030, according to the IPCC. We can’t physically ramp up renewables fast enough.” Anti-nuclear campaigning has been a foundational shibboleth for groups such as Greenpeace, which has pointed to disasters such as Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 as evidence that the sector should be shut down. While the UCS have never been militant opponents of nuclear power, Clemmer said “we are getting a bit more vocal” about the benefits of keeping plants open as the scale of the climate crisis has become clearer. Many opponents remain implacable, however. “Nuclear reactors are a bad bet for a climate strategy,” said Dr Gregory Jaczko, who was chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission during the Obama administration. “The Union of Concerned Scientist models don’t reflect the reality of the United States electricity market. Renewables are getting cheaper faster than expected and are in some cases the least expensive source of electricity.” Jaczko said new nuclear is a “financial boondoggle”, with investments better placed in solar or wind. “Employing nuclear for climate change is like Dorothy seeking the Wizard of Oz to get home,” he added. “It’s an expensive enticing mirage.” Clemmer said he agreed that new nuclear plants are enormously expensive but said there was a case for the US government to invest around $814m a year to keep existing unprofitable plants online, given the cleaner energy they provide. “Environmental groups may come round to this, but I’m just not sure,” he said."
"Bristol has declared a “climate emergency”, with the council unanimously backing a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2030 in an effort to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. The motion put forward by Green party councillor Carla Denyer and passed on Tuesday means the city has the most ambitious emissions targets of the UK’s core cities group – with radical policy implications in the coming years.  The move was triggered by a UN report last month which said the world has just 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. Denyer said: “This is a fantastic day for Bristol and I’m delighted the council will be bringing forward its target for making the city carbon neutral by 2030. She said the UN report made it clear that “time to preserve Earth as we know it is running out”. “We can’t wait for the UN or national governments to negotiate when we have just 12 years to act – we have to show how it’s done and commit to ambitious action at the level of cities, which we did this evening.” The target is much more radical than the UK government’s national target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 and comes amid growing concern about interlinked ecological crisis, from climate breakdown to extinction. In a sign of the growing frustration about lack of action, thousands of people are expected to take part in civil disobedience in the UK this weekend as part of the Extinction Rebellion campaign. Denyer said that the Bristol declaration could see a focus on renewable electricity, carbon neutral buildings, congestion charges and investment in clean transport infrastructure. It could also have far-reaching implications for big-ticket projects like the proposed expansion of Bristol airport. “It will mean viewing all policy decisions through their impact on greenhouse gas emissions,” she added. Denyer said that although there would be changes for residents, they would lead to wider benefits. “It should be possible to achieve while maintaining the same or even improved quality of life, because changes that reduce carbon dioxide emissions often also address inequality, public health, air quality, etc. “For example, encouraging active travel and public transport – that would reduce congestion as well as improving health outcomes by reducing air pollution and increasing uptake of cycling and walking.” The move was inspired by US cities such as Berkeley and Hoboken, and the global C40 cities which have all set ambitious emissions targets. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, said Bristol’s decision – which won cross-party support on the council – had set “a gold standard on climate action”. “With the UN warning we have just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe this is the common-sense policymaking we need to face the future.”"
"Warmer winters are linked to increased crime rates in parts of the United States, a new study has found. Researchers found that violent crime is almost always more prevalent when temperatures are warmer in the winter months. The trend was especially strong when winters were mild in regions that usually have fierce winters, like the north-east and midwest.  The study has implications for how America reacts to climate change as the promise of a warming climate could therefore lead to rising crime levels. Researchers compared crime and climate data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, covering 16,000 cities across the north-east, south-east, south central, west and midwest regions for the study published in GeoHealth. The crime data covered the years 1979 to 2016. “The relationship between climate, human interaction and crime that we’ve unveiled is something that will have an impact on people’s wellbeing,” said Ryan Harp, the lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. The explanation is simple enough: warmer temperatures mean more people are out and about, creating the opportunity for crime. In technical terms, three elements needed for a crime to occur – a motivated offender, a suitable target and the absence of a guardian such as a police officer – are more likely to come together when the weather is decent. The link between warmer temperatures and crime all but disappears during the summer months, the study found. That finding cast doubt on an alternative theory, known as the temperature aggression hypothesis, which holds that heat causes stress which makes people more likely to commit crimes."
"On Wednesday I will join hundreds of others in Parliament Square to assert that we will not stand idly by in the face of climate breakdown and ecological crisis. We will affirm a commitment to engage in non-violent but illegal activities to try and force urgent action. Collectively we have signed a declaration to this effect; an Extinction Rebellion against the British government for criminal inaction. Over decades we have all operated in our different spheres of life – whether as journalists, academics, politicians, campaigners and educators – to ring the alarm about the way planetary life support systems are being destroyed. But a powerful alliance of wealthy individuals and multinational corporations, backed by complicit politicians, has subverted the political process and blocked action. This is why, whoever we are and whatever we do, we are coming together now to say we are prepared to engage in civil disobedience to force urgent climate action.  We are prepared to halt lorries entering fracking sites; to stand in the way of bulldozers building roads and block traffic along heavily congested and polluted streets. Direct actions like these have a long and proud history; it’s time to carry them through in a systematic way to protect the climate, and to be willing to be arrested for doing so. So how have we have reached a situation where a law maker like me feels there is no alternative but to become a law breaker? Here my Quaker heritage is helpful. Our thin pamphlet of theological guidance ncludes the useful advice: “Respect the laws of the state but let your first loyalty be to God’s purposes.” As a Quaker, I don’t believe that spiritual wisdom resides in books or rituals but in the still, small voice that tells you when something must change. When the inward light, that I believe we all have within us, prompts you to stand up to a fascist bully or to engage in civil disobedience to halt climate breakdown, you have no choice but to follow. I represent some 5 million people in the European parliament. But who represents the generations as yet unborn that will have no chance of a decent and civilised life unless we act on climate change? Who represents the thousands of species that are becoming extinct during the modern era? A mass extinction that is entirely the result of human actions, and which we are living through almost without noticing? I am proud of the way 50 Green MEPs, of 750 elected across Europe, have achieved policy breakthroughs. Just last week we won a vote on banning plastics and limiting the use of antibiotics on farms. And my work on sustainable finance has a real chance of creating financial incentives to shift investment away from fossil fuels and towards projects that will protect wild habitats. But it isn’t enough. Green voters in the UK are grossly underrepresented because of our unfair electoral system. So British policy on energy and transport is stuck in the past, while other European countries with a strong green contingent in their parliaments are far more advanced in the transition towards a green economy. A spur towards direct action against this government and in defence of our planet conveniently appeared this week. As finance speaker for the Green party, I had called for an emergency budget for the climate, and the party issued a challenge: if the budget offers a single pound to climate-wrecking projects it will have failed. Well, the chancellor didn’t mention climate change once in his statement, and, rather than action to avert climate breakdown, we saw the chancellor accelerate it. He threw £30bn at road building while freezing fuel duty for the ninth year running, meaning this now amounts to a £9bn tax giveaway a year. There was also a sneaky £3bn tax break for oil and gas companies in the North Sea, through the removal of “tax barriers” to investment. This was just the enticement we needed to take the government on. The latest IPCC report and Tuesday’s Living Planet report by WWF, which reveals that wildlife populations have declined by more than half in less than 50 years, show how urgently change is needed. It is no exaggeration to say that our survival as a species is at risk. Enough. Enough of words; of hypocrisy and broken promises. It’s time to act. • Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England"
"How is it possible to live with despair? If, in the wake of last month’s horrifying UN report on global warming, you’ve been asking yourself this question, take some solace (or at least solidarity) from the knowledge that you’re not alone. Jonathan Franzen has been grappling with it for years, and as the final-countdown title of his new volume of essays suggests, his despair at the state of the planet and our absolute inability (“political, psychological, ethical, economic”) to save it is, if anything, deepening. “I don’t have any hope that we can stop the change from coming,” he says bluntly at the conclusion of his opening essay, and nothing in the following pages suggests he is anywhere close to changing his mind. But by refusing to hope for the impossible, Franzen, improbably, manages to produce a volume that feels, if not hopeful, then at least not hopeless. There’s nothing he can do – there’s probably nothing any of us can do – to avert or even alleviate the coming catastrophe. But for now, he’s here and he’s alive, and over the course of these essays he offers us a series of partial, tentative answers to the question he poses himself at the beginning: “How do we find meaning in our actions when the world seems to be coming to an end?” This is not a collection that wastes time attempting to persuade us of the reality of the climate crisis; frankly, we’re way past that. “Drastic planetary overheating,” Franzen assures us, “is a done deal” – and by the way, we need to revise significantly upward our definition of what “drastic” means. The notional two-degree figure widely cited by politicians as the upper limit of what we, and the planet, could possibly accommodate is a line we’re on course to gallop past in just a few years’ time. By 2100, we may well be looking at a five or six-degree temperature rise, and even then there’s a possibility we’re being lowballed. “The scientist who confidently predicts a five-degree warming by the end of the century,” Franzen suggests, towards the end of the collection, “might tell you in private, over beers, that she really expects it to be nine.” It’s a body blow moment in a book that declines to pull its punches, and Franzen acknowledges that many of his readers – “the people for whom the prospect of a hot, calamity-filled future is unbearably sad and frightening” – might be “forgiven for not wanting to think about it”. But over the course of these essays, he succeeds in demonstrating that resignation brings with it a curious intellectual freedom. His acknowledgment that the macro problem is beyond him allows him to start thinking more creatively about micro solutions: what can be achieved here, now, today. Naturally, there’s another way to read his position. Viewed through the other end of the telescope, Franzen’s acceptance of the coming crisis could be seen as an abdication of responsibility: resignation in terms of action, rather than comprehension; a ducking of the issue that’s just a left-liberal version of the US president’s fatuous claim that the climate will “change back”. It’s an accusation to which Franzen is acutely sensitive, not least because it has been levelled at him before. In the collection’s opening piece, “The Essay in Dark Times”, published as “Is it too Late to Save the World?”, what begins as a fascinating consideration of the role of the essay at a moment of objective peril evolves, via a circuitous route that takes in quitting smoking, birdwatching in Ghana and Trump’s election, into a critical rereading of another essay (“Save What You Love”, also collected here) that he wrote for the New Yorker, some two-and-a-half years earlier. That one was triggered by his fury at the actions of the National Audubon Society, the US’s foremost organisation for bird conservation. Franzen’s passion for birdwatching is almost as well known as his novels, so to say the Audubon Society was an unlikely target is an understatement. But it was precisely “as a bird-lover” that it attracted his ire. In 2014, the Society had, “with much fanfare”, thrown all its resources into the climate change fight, declaring that global warming was “the number-one threat to the birds of North America”. There’s no question that climate change poses an existential threat in the medium-term, however, “in 2014, the most serious threats to American birds were habitat loss and outdoor cats”. In Franzen’s view, the society’s position was both “narrowly dishonest” and potentially harmful, in that it might discourage people “from tackling solvable environmental problems in the here and now”. He said as much in his essay, was duly denounced as a “climate-change denier”, and retreated in a mixture of shame and regret on the one hand, and injured self-justification on the other. The irony, of course, was that he wasn’t attempting to deny climate change at all: “In fact, I’m such a climate-science accepter that I don’t even bother having hope for the ice caps.” Rather, he was denying that our current piecemeal, unserious attempts to mitigate it will have any consequential effect, and arguing that therefore we might better expend our efforts on conservation projects whose benefits “are immediate and tangible”. Where Franzen perfectly strikes the balance between form, content and voice you know you’re in the presence of a master It’s a complex position, both to articulate and to accept. But it is not, in the years since he first set it out, one that he has backed away from, because it represents the only hope he has left, and the central hope of this collection: that facing the future “honestly, however painful this may be, is better than denying it”. Rather, as these essays show, the conclusion he has come to is that it’s not his position that’s lacking, but his ability to put it across in a way that readers can accept. It’s a challenge to him as a writer: to think harder; to write more clearly and with more sympathy. It’s a question of what the essay, as a form and specifically in his hands, can do. And it’s a challenge to which he rises. This isn’t a flawless collection: there are uneven moments, and occasional longueurs. There are also – and I say this as a bird-lover – a whole lot of birds. They are the animating spirits of the collection, flitting and rustling through the essays, and Franzen ably makes the case both for their hold over him and their symbolic significance (“If you could see every bird in the world, you’d see the whole world”). But as the pages turn and the feathers pile up, it becomes harder and harder to keep the murres, taikos and storm petrels straight in your head – or, finally, to invest too deeply in the differences. Yet there are essays in which the balance between form, content and voice is perfectly struck, and when you reach one of those, it’s clear that you’re in the presence of a master. The opening essay, in which the idea of the essay itself is held up to the light, is a thing of supple, compelling intelligence, and by placing “Save What You Love”, his piece on the Audubon Society, after his retrospective analysis of its weaknesses, he effectively contextualises it, and allows us to read it for what it is: a teasing-out of complex arguments that refuses to reach for satisfying but reductive conclusions. Then there’s the title essay, which comes fittingly at the collection’s close, brings together all of its strands (climate change, humanity, thinking, writing, birds), and is simply a delight. In it, Franzen weaves together, lightly but tightly, two narrative threads: his expedition on a cruise ship to Antarctica, and the life of his uncle Walt, whose unlooked-for bequest paid for the trip. The timelines diverge wildly (the trip takes a couple of weeks; Walt lived to a ripe old age) but by combining them, Franzen expertly shows how they speak to each other. They’re both stories about death: Walt, we learn, “lost his daughter” (in a car crash in her 20s), “his war buddies, his wife, and my mother” before mortality caught up with him; the Antarctic is both a death zone, the literal and metaphorical end of the world, and, thanks to climate change, dying itself. But read on, and we find that the real resonance between the two tales is the urgent case they make for the worth and beauty of life. Walt survived his tragedies, kept faith with the world, and “never stopped improvising”; in Antarctica, Franzen comes face to face with a king penguin in the wild, and finds that it “seemed to me, in itself, sufficient reason not only to have made the journey; it seemed reason enough to have been born on this planet”. It’s the work of a writer at the top of his game – limber and lovely, delivering deep insights with delicacy and grace – and it poignantly makes the only case for climate action that has any chance of succeeding: that there is so much worth living for. “Even in a world of dying,” Franzen concludes, “new loves continue to be born.” • The End of the End of the Earth by Jonathan Franzen (4th Estate, £16.99).

"Twenty-two people have been arrested after protesters daubed the windows of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in London and blocked passing traffic in an effort to provoke society into action over climate change. One protester climbed above the revolving doors of the main entrance of the building in Westminster and wrote “frack off” in black spray paint, and another sprayed the extinction symbol in red on windows facing traffic on Victoria Street. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the group that coordinated the demonstration, said their members used spray chalk, which washes off. During the day, protesters superglued themselves to card-entry gates inside the staff entrance to the building, and lay down outside in Victoria Street blocking westbound traffic.  The protest is intended to be the first in a series continuing throughout the week and culminating with a mass civil disobedience action on Saturday, which activists are calling “rebellion day”.

At another entrance, protesters from the group Christian Climate Action could be seen through windows to have entered the lobby of the building and locked themselves to fittings. Bell Selkie, 48, from Wales, sitting glued by her left hand to the door of BEIS, said the effects of climate change were becoming obvious. Bell Selkie, 48, centre, farmer from Wales, locked on and glued to the doors of the department of business, environment and industrial strategy: ""I live on a farm and the harvests are failing and it's very obvious to me that climate change is hitting now.""#extinctionrebellion pic.twitter.com/P0MWndqsLx “The IPCC report in October gave us six to 12 years, and this is known to be a conservative report. If we don’t respond with a war-style effort now we are all fucked, all of us. My heart is breaking and I’ve got to do something, and I’m putting my life on hold,” she said. Some protesters wore high-visibility vests and patches with the words “conscientious protector”. Asked what that meant, one demonstrator, who preferred not to be named, said: “I have a conscience and I’ve never done anything like this before; I have to do something. We have to protect the environment because if we don’t, all the other problems, all the other causes that exist, are pointless. Everything else is pointless.” The Green party peer Jenny Jones came to witness the demonstration after seeing news of it on social media from her office in the House of Lords. She said she backed non-violent direct action. “If we’re not bold then we won’t have a usable planet in the next few decades,” she said. “The fact is we need action, we need it fast. This government has dragged its feet long enough. Whether it’s solar subsidies, making windfarms difficult or even actually supporting things like fracking, this government has actually gone in the wrong direction almost every time. So let’s hope they listen.” Contacts from inside the building said announcements had been made over the internal public address system that entrances and exits were blocked and no one was able to enter or leave the department. In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said: “The UK government, specifically BEIS, is promoting fracking – meeting with fracking companies more than 30 times in the last three years, compared to zero times with anti-fracking groups – despite massive local opposition. “From Preston New Road (665 days now and counting) in Lancashire, to Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire, to Horse Hill in Surrey, communities are coming together to fight against fracking.” "
"Veganism, once widely seen as an alternative, if not an extreme, lifestyle, is now in the mainstream. Exactly how many people in the UK have eliminated animal products including dairy and honey from their diets is uncertain. One recent survey suggested there could be as many as 3.5 million vegans in the UK. The Vegan Society offers the much lower figure of 600,000 vegans, which still represents a fourfold increase in four years. But either way, and combined with a big increase in vegetarians and occasional meat-eaters (otherwise known as “flexitarians”), a huge shift in eating habits is under way. This week’s annual food and drink report by the supermarket Waitrose says around a third of people have either cut down on or stopped eating meat altogether. There is more than one explanation for this change in behaviour. More than half of those surveyed by Waitrose said animal welfare was their motivation for changing their diet. The intensive farming and slaughter of livestock has long aroused feelings of regret and distaste in many people who do not object on principle to eating meat. Such feelings, along with concerns around health and sustainability, have led to rising demand for organic and free-range products among those who can afford them. The growing trend towards giving up meat altogether suggests either that the moral objections have spread, that other factors than animal welfare are in play – or, most likely, some combination of both.  These other factors are health and the environment. Expert advice on diet has long focused on a balanced intake of nutrients, and eating more fruit and vegetables and less sugar and fat. There is no simple answer to the question of whether it is healthier to be a carnivore or not. But over the past few years what was once suspected has become official: cured and processed meats can cause bowel cancer, and are classified by the World Health Organization as a group-one carcinogen, alongside tobacco and asbestos. Little wonder, then, that health-conscious people are giving up BLTs. While the health case for vegetarian and vegan diets is inward-looking, the environmental arguments point urgently outwards and forwards in time. Last month a major international study concluded that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential, especially in the western countries that eat most of it, since food production is a big contributor to global warming as well as deforestation, water shortages and pollution from fertilisers. This was one of the main arguments for veganism made by the freelance journalist Selene Nelson in an article this week, after her exchange of emails with Waitrose Food magazine editor William Sitwell led to his resignation. Mr Sitwell had responded to her pitch for a vegan series featuring recipes and tips with a reply that joked he might instead commission a series about “killing vegans” to “expose their hypocrisy”. Since Waitrose is currently promoting new vegan lines, it was unimpressed when these comments ended up in the press. What might have been laughed off in a note to a colleague was poorly judged as a response to a freelancer’s pitch for paid work. Had he thought better of his rudeness and sent a follow-up email, the story might have had a different ending. Vegans, as has been pointed out by Mr Sitwell’s defenders, are not a minority it is a crime to insult. What they are, to those who would rather ignore the peril of rising carbon emissions, is an irritation. To others who share their concerns, they offer a challenge – even an inspiration."

"It’s a stark message from a Nobel-prize winning economist. “We were a very different country 40 years ago,” he says. “The downhill slide has been pretty fast. America, I think, should be an important warning to other countries not to take for granted their institutions. I worry that things in the United States could get much worse.”  Joseph Stiglitz is coming to Australia next week. The renowned economist and Columbia University professor has been awarded the 2018 Sydney peace prize for leading one of the defining public policy discussions of our age – the crisis caused by economic inequality. Stiglitz is credited with pioneering the concept of the “1 per cent”, the idea that the upper 1% of Americans have accumulated so much political power and wealth in recent decades – through voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the corrupting influence of money – that the country’s economy has suffered, and its democracy has been undermined. In 2011, barely two years into Barack Obama’s first presidential term, he warned the political upheavals then roiling countries including Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and Bahrain could one day be visited upon the US, but in an American way. Later that year, the Occupy Wall Street protest emerged in Manhattan’s financial district. His 2012 bestselling book The Price of Inequality explained in detail how America had been growing apart, at an increasingly rapid rate. He argued forcefully that the severe inequality in the US was a choice of the country’s leaders: a consequence of their policies, laws and regulations. This month he plotted in Scientific American how inequality had worsened so much over the last 40 years that US democracy was imperilled. “Whereas the income share of the top 0.1% has more than quadrupled and that of the top 1% has almost doubled, that of the bottom 90% has declined,” he wrote. “Wages at the bottom, adjusted for inflation, are about the same as they were some 60 years ago. Wealth is even less equally distributed, with just three Americans having as much as the bottom 50%.” “As more of our citizens come to understand why the fruits of economic progress have been so unequally shared, there is a real danger that they will become open to a demagogue blaming the country’s problems on others and making false promises of rectifying ‘a rigged system’. “We are already experiencing a foretaste of what might happen. It could get much worse.” Stiglitz tells Guardian Australia, in the lead-up to his trip to Australia, that this country has a lot to learn from America. “One of the reasons I wrote [The Price of Inequality] is almost as a warning to other countries,” he says. “Some of the forces attacking what I would call the social order … those who are shortsighted and in the 1%, know that what they want is contrary to what would evolve in a functioning democracy. “Most Americans want a higher minimum wage, they want gun control, they want access to healthcare, they want stronger financial regulation – the polling on some of these issues is, you know, 75% or more – and yet our democracy can’t deliver it. “Those on the other side have to undermine democracy if they’re going to thwart the will of such a large majority, so they undermine it by disenfranchisement and disempowerment.” Stiglitz says the vision of policymakers in the aftermath of the second world war was to draw together a community that had fought together, to help society become more equal. In the 1960s that was reinforced with demands for racial and social and gender justice, to break down further the forces that had long-divided society. “It was a continuation if you looked at it in a grand historical [perspective] where we’d gotten rid of feudalism and hereditary privilege and we were moving step by step to a greater system of social justice,” he says. “That was our vision, with the civil rights movement.” But the election of Donald Trump as president, and a Republican push to further undermine economic equality, mean the old social contract is being further undermined. “Now we have Trump – a misogynist, a racist, a bigot – as president and openly espousing these things, and we have the majority of the Republican party voting for a tax bill that increases inequality and leads more people to have no insurance coverage. It’s further undermining the social contract and [the old] vision.” Stiglitz says he plans to talk about all of these things in Australia, including the problem of climate change – which he says presents the strongest critique of the capitalist system. “It reminds one of Jared Diamond’s story of collapse on Easter Island where they cut down the last tree and there they were, unable to paddle to any other island and they’d destroyed their future,” he says. “We’re doing the same. The magnitude of the dysfunction is unbelievable. And what’s remarkable about it is, some of the work I’ve done has shown the cost to our society of dealing with this is minuscule, at most 2% of GDP, whereas the cost of not dealing with it could be horrendous.” He says any view of a well-managed society would be “why not deal with the threat of climate change?” “Particularly because the way you’d do it would actually stimulate the economy.” Prof Joseph Stiglitz will be in Australia to receive the Sydney peace prize. He will be awarded the prize at the City of Sydney peace prize lecture on 15 November, and speak at the National Press Club in Canberra on 14 November and at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne on 19 November"
"It is depressing to think that for the first time since the return of democracy in 1985 Brazilians have elected a far-right president of the republic. Jair Bolsonaro, a seven-term lawmaker and former army captain, represents a clear and present danger not only to his country but to the planet. At home he has defended dictatorship and torture and joked about killing his leftwing opponents. He has a history of denigrating women, gay people and minorities. The president-elect promises to bring order by spreading chaos with a relaxation of gun laws. This will cost lives in a country that already records more than 60,000 murders a year. In a familiar but chilling pattern, Mr Bolsonaro successfully pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate, appealing to voters fed up with political graft and violent crime. There’s every reason to think that Brazilians who voted in haste for Mr Bolsonaro will repent at leisure. Mr Bolsonaro’s programme, if taken seriously, and his environmental utterances, if taken literally, amount to a threat to humanity. Brazil’s new president takes office in January, in charge of the world’s lungs, the Amazon, and the world’s breadbasket, the Cerrado savannah. He will be able to decide the course of the battle against climate change at a critical point. The signs are not good. It is thought that we have 12 years to prevent the dangerous destabilisation of Earth’s climate because of the way we live. Our patterns of existence have already led to widespread annihilation of wildlife, a disaster so large that it threatens civilisation. Yet Mr Bolsonaro’s key election pledge was to put his presidency behind Brazil’s huge agri-corporations. He favours business over biodiversity and calls for pro-market ways of exploiting Brazil’s natural resources, notably coming out against the policy of reserving the 12% of the country’s land for indigenous tribes. The far-right president-elect has also promised to weaken the enforcement of environmental laws, while criminalising activism. It is a package of measures that will not reform the model of capitalism that is slowly boiling the atmosphere, but turbocharge it.  Mr Bolsonaro says he will not scrap the Paris climate agreement, where Brazil set itself ambitious climate targets, as long as he gets assurances that his country would not cede sovereignty to native tribes or international jurisdiction over the Andes mountains, Amazon rainforest and Atlantic Ocean. This is a contradiction that will prove impossible to resolve: Mr Bolsonaro’s policies will help pave over the rainforest – with new highways and dams promised in the Amazon basin – and make it all but impossible for Brazil to reduce its carbon footprint. Until now Brazil has been, on balance, a moral force for the environmental good: largely resisting siren calls to exploit its vast natural resources for shareholder value, while bringing together rich and poor nations during climate talks. It was the frontrunner to hold the next UN climate talks. Now, instead of helping, the world’s fourth largest democracy looks like it will do irreparable harm. With the US administration run by climate-change sceptics and China tacking away from its green stance, Europe must take a lead. The EU has a hand to play with Brazil. Deforestation is largely driven by demand for land to grow soybeans – exported to feed livestock – and to expand cattle farms. The EU is the biggest foreign investor in Brazil. Latin America’s largest economy is the biggest exporter of agricultural products to Europe. There is a strong case for new European laws to guarantee that no products or financial transactions linked to the EU lead to deforestation, forest degradation and human rights violations. If the EU acts the UK should follow suit to curb Mr Bolsonaro’s worst environmental instincts, which are a menace to everyone on the planet."
"Knowingly creating a false impression of the world: this is a serious matter. It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”. His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts”. In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems – and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths – I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.  It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect. For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action. You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife film-makers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know – and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it – that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world that persuades us all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it. What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it. Since 1985, when I worked in the department that has made most of his programmes, I have pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995 I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to get environment off this fucking channel. Why the fuck are you bringing me environment?’” I later discovered that this response was typical. The controllers weren’t indifferent. They were actively hostile. If you ask me whether the BBC or ExxonMobil has done more to frustrate environmental action in this country, I would say the BBC. We all knew that only one person had the power to break this dam. For decades David Attenborough, a former channel controller widely seen as the living embodiment of the BBC, has been able to make any programme he wants. So where, we kept asking, was he? At last, in 2000, he presented an environmental series: State of the Planet. It was an interesting and watchable series, but it left us with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Only in the last few seconds of the final episode was there a hint that structural forces might be at play: “Real success can only come if there’s a change in our societies, in our economics and in our politics.” But what change? What economics? What politics? He had given us no clues. To make matters worse, it was sandwiched between further programmes of his about the wonders of nature, which created a strong impression of robust planetary health. He might have been describing two different worlds. Six years later he made another environmental series, The Truth About Climate Change. And this, in my view, was a total disaster. It told us nothing about the driving forces behind climate breakdown. The only mention of fossil fuel companies was as part of the solution: “The people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back underground.” Apart from the general “we”, the only distinct force identified as responsible was the “1.3 billion Chinese”. That a large proportion of Chinese emissions are caused by manufacturing goods the west buys was not mentioned. The series immediately triggered a new form of climate denial: I was bombarded with people telling me there was no point in taking action in Britain because the Chinese were killing the planet. If Attenborough’s environmentalism has a coherent theme, it is shifting the blame from powerful forces on to either society in general or the poor and weak. Sometimes it becomes pretty dark. In 2013 he told the Telegraph “What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about? They’re about too many people for too little land … We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.” There had not been a famine in Ethiopia for 28 years, and the last one was caused not by an absolute food shortage but by civil war and government policies. His suggestion that food relief is counter-productive suggests he has read nothing on the subject since Thomas Malthus’s essay in 1798. But, cruel and ignorant as these comments were, they were more or less cost-free. By contrast, you do not remain a national treasure by upsetting powerful vested interests: look at the flak the outspoken wildlife and environmental presenter Chris Packham attracts for standing up to the hunting lobby. I have always been entranced by Attenborough’s wildlife programmes, but astonished by his consistent failure to mount a coherent, truthful and effective defence of the living world he loves. His revelation of the wonders of nature has been a great public service. But withholding the knowledge we need to defend it is, I believe, a grave disservice. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Hundreds of students around the country are preparing to strike from school because of what they say is a failure by politicians to recognise climate change as an emergency. They’ve been inspired by 15-year-old Greta Thunberg, a Swedish student who has been sitting outside the parliament in central Stockholm to draw attention to the fears younger generations hold about the global climate crisis and the failure of countries to take urgent action.  Fourteen-year-old Milou Albrecht, a year 8 student at Castlemaine Steiner school in Victoria, her classmate Harriet O’Shea Carre, and 11-year-old Callum Bridgefoot from Castlemaine North primary school, started by protesting last week outside of the offices of their local representatives, the Labor MP Lisa Chester and the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie. They’ve been joined by 50 students from local schools and are planning weekly events. And what began as a small local protest is growing into a nationwide movement. Students in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Perth, Hobart, the Whitsundays, Lismore, the Gold Coast, Albury-Wodonga and the Sunshine Coast are planning to walk out of classes this month. Similar plans are being explored in other regional areas including Coffs Harbour, Cairns, Townsville and the southern highlands of New South Wales. Hundreds of students have indicated they want to attend protests outside state parliaments in the capital cities on 28, 29 and 30 November. The idea for the strikes came from the Castlemaine students, who contacted the Australian Youth Climate Coalition for help. They have had assistance from the coalition and their parents with contacting media, building a website and spreading the word about the strikes through their social networks. “We think it’s important because it’s a huge problem,” Milou said. “The Earth is already too hot, with droughts in winter in NSW and the coral reef is dying.” She said students were speaking to Greta in Sweden each week. “I would like our politicians to acknowledge climate change is an emergency and take the necessary steps in order to have a sustainable world,” she said. A 14-year-old Fort Street high school student, Jean Hinchliffe, is organising the Sydney walkout on 30 November. She said there was a template letter students who were worried about taking time off class could give to their teachers. “We’ve got involved because at this stage we can’t vote, we’re not politicians and we want to make a difference,” she said. “We can’t stand around waiting. “I think it’s because climate change is scary seeing that it’s our future. This is a fact and not to be debated.”"

"Heatwaves severely damage the fertility of male beetles and consecutive hot spells leave them virtually sterilised, according to research. Global warming is making heatwaves more common and wildlife is being annihilated, and the study may reveal a way in which these two trends are linked. The scientists behind the findings said there could also be some relevance for humans: the sperm counts of western men have halved in the last 40 years.  Researchers studied beetles because their 400,000 species represent about a quarter of all known species. Insect populations are plunging worldwide as temperatures rise, falling by about 80% in 30 years in Puerto Rico’s rainforest and by 75% in German nature reserves. Insects are such an integral part of life, as pollinators and prey, that scientists say their decline could lead to “ecological Armageddon”. Little is known about the precise causes of the decline, though climate change, habitat destruction and global use of pesticides are considered probable factors. The research, published in the Nature Communications journal, found that exposing beetles to a five-day heatwave in the laboratory reduced sperm production by three-quarters; females were unaffected. “Beetles are thought to constitute a quarter of biodiversity, so these results are very important for understanding how species react to climate change,” said Kris Sales, at the University of East Anglia, who led the work. Other research has shown that heat can damage male reproduction in humans as well as cows, sheep and other mammals. “There could be relevance for human fertility,” said Prof Matt Gage, co-leader of the UEA research group. “The paradox is that one of the reasons the climate is warming up and we are having more heatwaves is there are too many humans. So maybe this is a leveller.” Stuart Wigby, of the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “Given what we already know about the generality of the sensitivity of sperm to heat, there is every reason to expect that similar effects would be seen in other insects and also in mammals including humans.” The red flour beetle used in the experiments is a tropical species that thrives at 35C. When exposed to temperatures of 5C and 7C higher, male fertility plummeted. While these were high temperatures, 90 countries had experienced them in recent years, said Gage. After being exposed to a heatwave, the number of offspring produced by males fell by half. Even more worryingly, harmful effects were inherited by the males they produced – their lives were 20% shorter and they in turn produced fewer offspring. The most extreme impact was in male beetles exposed to two heatwaves 10 days apart – their offspring production fell by 99%. “It kind of wipes them out,” Gage said. Sales added: “Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.” Further experiments are under way to find out whether the beetles can adapt to heat shocks and to examine how other species, such as butterflies, cope with raised temperatures. The research is among the first of its type on cold-blooded creatures. “There is a big gap, as most of life on Earth is cold-blooded and it is much more directly affected by temperature variations,” Gage said. “We’ve shown that sperm function is an especially sensitive trait when the environment heats up, and in [species] representing a huge amount of global biodiversity.” How the heat damages the sperm is not fully understood, though the researchers noticed damage to sperm membranes. It is likely that the DNA in the sperm is also damaged, meaning harm can be passed to offspring. Most warm-blooded male animals protect sperm from excessive heat by having testes outside the body, leaving them several degrees cooler. Wigby said the understanding of factors that reduced male fertility was poor. “So any studies that add to our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying variation in male fertility is valuable. Showing that the harm can occur in a heatwave-like scenario is new and important, as is the demonstration of transgenerational effects. However, the applicability to the real world is always an issue for lab studies.”"
"Democrats don’t have a plan to address climate change comprehensively – or even to a significant degree – if they regain control of the US government in the near future, despite criticizing Republicans as the party of pollution. After failing to get conservatives on board to limit planet-warming gases through legislation or regulation, Democratic leaders in Washington are now wary of wading into another tough political fight, despite an intensifying environmental crisis.  If Democrats win back the House in Tuesday’s midterm elections, their strategy is to hold oversight hearings on Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and pursue more incremental and popular measures, according to close observers and a senior Democratic aide. Environmental advocates hoping progressive politicians will lead efforts to save the planet may be shocked to learn there’s no wide-ranging strategy or headline-grabbing legislation waiting to be unveiled – even if Democrats take the White House in 2020. The party’s efforts as currently planned won’t be enough to spur the rapid transformation in how society operates that leading scientists say is needed to spare humanity from the worst of rising temperatures, extreme weather and massive societal and economic disruptions. But few in the party – or the big environmental groups that traditionally support it – are prepared to admit this outright. “Obviously, a transformative government response to climate is clearly needed based on what we’re seeing from science. We have about 10 years left to really be doing something, but it’s hard [for us] to do because the Republican party is largely in denial on this,” said Congressman John Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president in 2020. Congressman Ted Deutch, the Florida Democrat and cofounder of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House, said he’s not “rosy eyed” that Democrats in the majority could get Republicans to reverse their stances on the environment and climate. “But I’m also not a cynic,” Deutch said. “I don’t reject the possibility of a major piece of legislation, and I think it’s possible to put together a bipartisan bill.” Democrats have a decent chance of winning a majority in the House of Representatives in the 6 November midterm elections this year, while the Republicans are predicted to keep control of the Senate. A senior Democratic aide familiar with the party’s policy blueprints was resigned to the situation. The aide said it doesn’t make sense for the House to work on legislation that Republicans in the Senate will never take up. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is politically sensitive, said Democrats will instead try to encourage infrastructure projects to prepare communities for climate change and invest in green power.The source said “increasing public awareness will be a huge part of an eventual solution” and that Democrats hope to lay that groundwork. But the current leadership isn’t considering anything like the contentious cap on greenhouse gases that Democrats pushed for in 2009 or a tax on industry for carbon pollution. The aide said Republicans have “demonized” attempts to slow climate change, making the issue politically intractable. That is despite almost daily reports of melting glaciers, dying wildlife and worsening storms in the US and across the globe.Democrats don’t only fear futile battles over legislation with Republicans. They also are wary of turning moderate Americans against the party if climate solutions raise the cost of living. George David Banks, a former Trump White House energy and climate adviser, said Democrats aren’t planning any major legislation because they are “still dealing with the fallout from the failure of Waxman-Markey”. Democrats have twice tried and failed to take major steps on climate change. In 2009 when they controlled Congress and the White House, the House passed the controversial “Waxman-Markey” proposal to cap greenhouse gases, but the Senate never took it up following a massive lobbying campaign against it that included ads warning of higher gasoline prices. After that defeat, the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 finalized a rule for power companies to burn less coal. But the supreme court halted it and Trump’s administration is in the process of rolling it back. Progressive environmental advocates say Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, aren’t thinking big enough now. “What I worry about is that Pelosi is going to get bogged down with oversight and is going to introduce a bunch of small-bore tax credit bills,” said RL Miller, the cofounder of the grassroots-focused advocacy group Climate Hawks Vote. Miller cautioned that while smaller federal efforts and states’ work to limit climate pollution are good, the US will still need to make big changes across every sector of its economy. Polling shows that while a majority of Americans care about climate change, few rank the environment as the most important problem. “What I expect Democrats to do is not what I hope Democrats would do,” she said. While 72% of voters backing Democrats see climate change as a “very big” problem, only 11% of those supporting Republicans do, according to the Pew Research Center, making any consensus extremely difficult.  But Sarah Hunt, the cofounder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy, who works with conservatives on climate efforts, said Democrats should offer an “alternative vision”, even if they don’t think it would succeed with Trump in the White House. Elan Strait, the World Wildlife Fund’s US climate campaigns director, argued the action just isn’t in Washington. “There’s no cigar back room where people are hammering out a climate deal because that’s not where the movement is right now … the movement really is at the city and state level,” he said, despite reports that local action isn’t enough. The carbon tax method, to charge businesses and their customers for greenhouse gas pollution, recently won a Nobel prize but currently has limited support in Washington, despite multiple proposals from some Democrats and Republicans. For now, the US policies under discussion do not come close to matching what science requires. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said she is “not aware of any comprehensive plan that would accomplish what the US needs to do” to meet the commitments it made to other countries in the Paris climate agreement, which is meant to keep warming to 2C but is not on track to succeed. “I want to see action, and so far there has been precious little of it,” Hayhoe said."
"More than a year after the US Environmental Protection Agency took down information on climate change from its website for an “update”, it now seems uncertain whether it will ever reappear. In April last year, the EPA replaced its online climate change section with a holding page that said the content was being updated to “reflect the agency’s new direction under President Donald Trump”.  Information previously found at epa.gov/climatechange made it clear that human activity was warming the planet, resulting in harm to Americans’ health as well as crucial ecosystems on which humans depend. The “update” page has now given way to a page that simply states: “We want to help you find what you are looking for.” Below, there are links to search other areas of the EPA website, as well as to an archived “snapshot” of the site from the day before Trump became president in January 2017. The switch was observed by the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, which tracks changes in government websites. “It’s an embarrassment. It is a ghost page,” said Judith Enck, who was EPA regional administrator during Barack Obama’s presidency. “It’s a bit like Amazon not allowing the public to order books via its website – it’s that fundamental. There’s no other issue at the EPA more important than climate change; it affects air, water, health and whether large parts of the world will survive.” Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic who was Trump’s pick as EPA administrator until he resigned in July amid a long-running ethics scandal, repeatedly questioned basic scientific understanding of climate change while he headed the agency, such as whether carbon dioxide is a primary driver of planetary warming. The EPA under the Trump administration has attempted to roll back all key measures designed to address climate change, such as limits on pollution from coal plants, rules to prevent methane emissions from oil and gas drilling and tighter fuel efficiency standards for cars. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who is now acting EPA administrator, has said “federal regulations are not necessary to drive greenhouse gas reductions”. A senior EPA official, who asked not to be named, said: “Wheeler has been somewhat meticulously going through the mess Pruitt left behind and I think is finally getting to the place of making some decisions on stuff.” The official added: “I’ve been surprised that we are still even talking about climate change and that there are still people nominally assigned to that beat in the air office.” Enck said that EPA career staff are “frustrated” and “ashamed” about the new stance on climate change and urged her former colleagues to speak out. The administration also began taking the ax to climate change language across other government websites in the spring of 2017. “The EPA website is used by decision and policy makers, not just for high school student assignments,” she said. “The lack of timely, accurate information is part of a much deeper problem that the agency is on the sidelines of the most urgent environment issue of our time.” The EPA was contacted for comment."
"How to push green issues up the political agenda is a question that has exercised environmentalists for decades. Do dark warnings about the world that awaits us if we do not curtail carbon emissions and protect forests and oceans motivate people to act, or scare them off? Are apocalyptic visions such as that in Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road what we need to open our minds, or an inducement to give up trying? Opinion is divided, as events of the past week have illustrated. In advance of his latest wildlife television series, Dynasties, David Attenborough said at the weekend that too many warnings about endangered species are a “real turn-off”. A few days earlier, the activist group Extinction Rebellion launched a campaign of civil disobedience by demanding a zero-carbon economy by 2025. Writing in advance of a protest in London that saw 15 people arrested, Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said she and others have been driven to break the law after spending years ringing alarm bells and being ignored.  Influenced by thinkers including Charles Eisenstein and Erica Chenoweth, whose ideas about peaceful protest have also been taken up by opponents of President Trump, and with a commitment to grassroots organising that is similar to 350.org (the anti-fossil-fuel organisation launched in the US by Bill McKibben in 2007), Extinction Rebellion aims to foment a mass movement that will change history. Elected politicians, goes the argument, have failed, as have businesses and other organisations including environmental charities. Carbon emissions and biodiversity loss are out of control. The “unimaginable horrors” of unchecked warming and habitat destruction mean more radical tactics are called for – and morally justified by the dangers, in the eyes of protesters. While the current focus on the extinction crisis is novel, and a contrast to more familiar warnings about emissions, the notion that environmental activism encompasses lawbreaking is not new. The Green party of England and Wales approves of civil disobedience in the statement of underlying principles known as its “philosophical basis”. Greenpeace has engaged in nonviolent direct action alongside the traditional NGO tools of lobbying and petitions since the 1970s. Activists have used occupations and blockades as techniques in protests against road-building, airports and coal-fired power stations. They have also mounted protests against sponsorship by oil companies in museums. Most recently, attempts to frack in Lancashire have been disrupted by protesters, three of whom were freed from prison last month after successfully appealing against sentences that judges found to be “manifestly excessive”. The heightened language of emergency and breakdown employed by this new grouping will not appeal to everyone. Nor is it intended to. It is rational to be sceptical about whether the protesters will achieve their aims. But on the basis of the most recent warnings about rising temperatures and species decline, and chancellor Philip Hammond’s failure to mention climate change at all in last week’s budget, it is not rational to deny that they are justified in rebelling against the government’s inaction. Their sense of urgency is welcome."

"Climate action is way off course in all but one of the world’s 20 biggest economies, according to a report that shows politicians are paying more heed to the fossil fuel industry than to advice from scientists. Among the G20 nations 15 reported a rise in emissions last year, according to the most comprehensive stock-take to date of progress towards the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The paper, by the global partnership Climate Transparency, found 82% of energy in these countries still being provided by coal, oil and gas, a factor which has relied on an increase of about 50% in subsidies over the past 10 years to compete with increasingly cheap wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. The G20 nations spent $147bn (£114bn) on subsidies in 2016, although they pledged to phase them out more than 10 years ago. Governments have said they will change, but on current commitments the world is on course for a 3.2C rise in average global temperatures, more than double the lower Paris threshold of 1.5C, which scientists have said represents the last chance to save coral reefs, the Arctic ecosystem and the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people at risk of increased drought, flooding and forest fires. “The gap is still very big,” said Jan Burck, one of the authors of the report. “The G20 is not moving fast enough.” Comparing the goals and policies of different countries, the paper found that only India was on course to stay below the upper limit set by the Paris agreement of 2C, while the worst offenders – Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey – would take the world beyond 4C. China, the world’s biggest emitter, stabilised its releases of carbon for a couple of years by reducing dependency on coal, but this positive trend slipped last year. Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina have promised to cut deforestation but the destruction rate of forests shows no sign of reversing. Britain has made the fastest transition, with a 7.7% decline in the use of fossil fuels between 2012 and 2015, but the report warned that this could stall in the years ahead because the government had cut support for feed-in tariffs, energy efficiency and zero-carbon homes. The authors said political pressures in the G20 countries, with more subsidies for fossil fuels, were working against effective climate action. “There is a huge fight by the fossil fuel industry against cheap renewables. The old economy is well organised and they have put huge lobbying pressure on governments to spend tax money to subsidise the old world,” Burck said. These political pressures are likely to intensify as governments are called upon to extend emissions cuts to the transport and agriculture sectors. The report said G20 emissions needed to start declining in the next two years and halve by 2030 if the world were to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, though not one country in the group had set a credible target to do this. The UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, in December –the COP24 conference – will start a two-year process for governments to deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions. Although there are national leaders hostile to tackling climate change, such as in the US and Brazil, there is still hope they will be open to taking their share of the responsibility. Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “Global emissions need to peak in 2020. The Brown-to-Green report provides us with an independent stock-take on where we stand now. This is valuable information for countries when they declare their contribution in 2020.” • This article was amended on 14 November 2018. An earlier version included figures from the report that were corrected after publication, when it said that fossil fuel subsidies in G20 countries have doubled between 2007 and 2016, from $75bn (£58bn) to $147bn (£114bn). The two figures were not comparable, because the 2007 figure did not include data for all G20 countries included in the 2016 figure. The increase over the past 10 years is about 50%, not double. In addition, an earlier version misspelled Jan Burck’s last name as Buerck. This has been corrected."
"Plans to build a huge new UK gas power station are facing a challenge from an environmental law group that argues the project would breach the government’s recommendations on climate change. ClientEarth, which has repeatedly defeated the government in court over its air pollution strategy, has submitted an objection to the planning inspectorate over Drax Group’s proposed 3.6GW plant in North Yorkshire.  The intervention is the first by the lawyers against a gas project in the UK. Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at the group, said it had acted because the Drax scheme marked a tipping point in the amount of new gas planned by energy firms in the UK. The UK has already given planning approval for 15GW-worth of large-scale gas plants, including at Eggborough, which is not far from the Drax site. Adding the Drax project would take the total to about 18GW, three times the 6GW of new gas the government estimates the country will need up to 2035. Hunter Jones said: “The UK government claims to be a climate leader, yet if major energy projects such as this from Drax are granted planning consent, the UK will risk carbon lock-in that would seriously undermine its ability to meet its climate change commitments.” The planning inspectorate is expected to make its recommendations to the government next spring, with ministers to decide later in the year. ClientEarth believes it has grounds for success under national policy statements that planners have to consider, which say such a major project’s impact must not outweigh its benefits. The group’s written submission said approval risked making the UK’s future decarbonisation significantly more difficult and expensive. Drax said future energy scenarios in the UK indicated the country would need more gas plants in the future to fill in the gaps around wind and solar power. The company also said that building the gas project would enable it to turn off its two remaining coal units in 2023, two years before the government’s coal phase-out deadline of 2025. Andy Koss, Drax Power’s CEO, said: “Our Repower project will deliver cost-effective, high-efficiency, flexible gas power to the grid. By reusing some of our existing infrastructure, including the grid connection and cooling towers, the development will be cost-effective and very competitive.”"
"Democrats in the House of Representatives are likely to reopen an intelligence committee investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election – and begin assisting the criminal inquiry on the same subject by the special counsel Robert Mueller. Devin Nunes, the committee’s outgoing Republican chairman and a Trump ally, obstructed efforts by Democrats to investigate possible collusion with Russia by Trump’s campaign team, and closed the investigation with leads left unexplored. Nunes also declined to share information with Mueller. But Adam Schiff, Nunes’s likely Democratic replacement, has promised to resume the committee’s inquiries and pursue new avenues such as the Trump Organization’s business links to Russia. The extension of the Republican majority in the Senate, however, may embolden Trump to nominate a harder-line replacement for the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, fired the day after the election, in order to get rid of Mueller and shut down the special counsel’s investigation. If that happens, expect some Democrats to propose rehiring Mueller as an independent counsel to continue his investigation on behalf of the House. Jon Swaine Now that Democrats have the House, President Trump’s dream of a “big, beautiful wall” will be all the more elusive. Before the midterms, the outgoing House speaker, Paul Ryan, promised there would be a “big fight” over the border wall immediately after the election. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this was still the plan on Wednesday morning, but Republicans now go into that fight against an emboldened Democratic party. By 8 December, Congress must reach a deal on Department of Homeland Security funding, including the wall – a narrow window for Republicans to secure significant wall funding before Democrats take control of the House in January. House Democrats have also said they will try to restore protections for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children. Voters on both sides of the aisle have expressed broad support for creating a pathway to citizenship for this population and the Trump administration has used them as a bargaining chip since revoking their protections in 2017. Amanda Holpuch Unless Trump gets re-elected in 2020, it now looks certain his massive tax bill will be his last. That $1.5tn giveaway, Trump’s largest congressional achievement, mainly benefited the very wealthy and corporations and has polled badly with voters, so badly that Republicans barely mentioned it in the run-up to the midterms. He has since promised another tax cut aimed at the middle class. Now, with Democrats in control of the House, any legislation will be hard to pass. There are areas of common ground – Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway has already mentioned infrastructure – but given the partisan divide in Washington, striking a deal is going to be difficult. The picture on trade also becomes more complex as the president’s powers are curtailed. Politicians in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere will all be watching to see how his defeat will affect the trade disputes he has fueled. Trump can still use executive orders to force through change but the president’s chances of passing meaningful legislation were hobbled on Tuesday. Now he will be buffeted by the larger, outside forces that will decide the US’s economic forces – forces that are beyond his control. Dominic Rushe Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at a national level are almost guaranteed to halt now that the House is in the hands of the Democrats. At the state level, Democratic governors-elect in Kansas, Maine and Wisconsin could expand ACA protections that Republican state leaders rejected. And in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah citizens voted to expand access to free or low-cost health coverage to the poor through Medicaid. Before the election, Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to return to her former role as House speaker, said a legislative priority would be lowering pharmaceutical drug costs – an issue that could have bipartisan support. And reproductive rights groups have called last night’s results a victory. Federal efforts to limit women’s reproductive rights will be challenged with Democrats in control of the House. And in Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico, the three governors-elect have a record for defending women’s reproductive rights. Amanda Holpuch Attempts to ramp up action to address climate change faltered, most notably in Washington state where voters rejected a proposal to implement a price on carbon pollution. The plan, which was vigorously opposed by oil and gas interests including BP, would have placed a $15 fee on each ton of CO2 and potentially acted as a springboard for other states to do likewise. Washington state voters have now rejected carbon pricing on three separate occasions, raising doubts as to whether the concept, backed by many economists as the best way to drive down emissions and avoid disastrous climate change, will gain traction in the US. Elsewhere, a ballot proposal to require that Arizona get half of its electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind was rejected by voters in the state. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent $40m to successfully fend off an attempt to impose a half-mile buffer between drilling operations and people’s homes. In Florida, however, voters backed a measure to ban oil and gas drilling in state waters. Oliver Milman Democrats picked up seven governor’s seats by early Wednesday. The governor races are particularly important because of a once-in-a-decade redistricting process due to begin in 2021. States will be required to redraw congressional districts to make sure each one represents the same number of residents. That’s where gerrymandering – the process where a party draws often oddly shaped districts to best maximize their voters – can occur. State legislatures do the redrawing, but it is the state’s governor who has the ability to sign or veto the new congressional map in their state. That means a Democrat governor elected on Tuesday to a four-year term would have the power to prevent Republicans – who have become experts at gerrymandering, most notably in Pennsylvania – from redrawing districts in a way which would benefit them in upcoming elections to the House of Representatives. Florida was seen as particularly important as the state is expected to gain two congressional seats after the 2020 census. That’s down to a long-term population shift away from the north-east and midwest towards states like Florida and Texas. Unfortunately for Democrats, Andrew Gillum lost on Tuesday. Adam Gabbatt"
"Since his first day on the job, when he surrounded himself with a National Park Service police escort and rode through Washington DC on a white-nosed horse named Tonto, the US interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, has exhibited a flair for ostentation. Not long after taking office in March 2017, the new secretary started flying a special flag, adorned with the agency’s bison seal, above the interior department’s elegant New Deal-era headquarters. At a cost of more than $2,000, he also commissioned commemorative coins emblazoned with his name to hand out to visitors and staff. He replaced the doors in his office to the tune of more than $130,000, and installed a hunting-themed arcade game in the department’s cafeteria. Yet to some longtime civil servants working at interior headquarters, this flashy behavior was merely a distraction from graver concerns. “There was a lot of eye-rolling and embarrassment about the flag and the horse and all of the ridiculousness,” said a former senior employee who left last year and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. For some, the dominant emotional tenor at the time was “fear and anxiety” as Zinke and his team ushered in “dramatic change” at the interior department. “All the new administration was interested in was their checklist for dismantling regulations and weakening environmental and land use protections,” said the former staffer. “Instead of asking why a senator or lobbyist or CEO was asking for a special favor and whether or not it was allowed under the law, this administration wanted to know why the special favor wasn’t already done and which deep state employee was standing in the way.” I have have seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle … but this is the worst Despite his public persona as a folksy Montanan with a Boy Scout’s penchant for pennants and horses, Zinke has taken shrewd and aggressive steps to transform from the inside a department whose 70,000 employees manage the country’s treasured national parks and its endangered species, in addition to overseeing vast energy and mineral deposits on at least 500m acres of public land. During Zinke’s first months in office, he reassigned at least 25 senior officials at the department, a move that led some of the affected staff to question whether they were being punished for past work on subjects such as climate change, and which prompted at least one high-profile resignation. He publicly questioned the allegiance of other of his newly inherited employees, saying he had “30% of the crew that’s not loyal to the flag”. Most importantly, Zinke rapidly installed a slew of conservative operatives and industry sympathizers in key positions throughout the agency. Because these senior advisers, counselors and other appointees are rarely subject to Senate approval, few people know their names. They nevertheless wield immense power and are responsible for much of the day-to-day work at the interior department. Hundreds of pages of correspondence and calendars reviewed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard show how Zinke and his top aides have favored corporate and conservative calls to prioritize resource extraction at the expense of conservation, while consistently delivering on industry desires – despite sometimes running afoul of conflict of interest rules. The interior department responded to only one of multiple inquiries made to it, saying through a spokesperson that “the Department has addressed these questions to you and other reporters on multiple occasions. Our position remains unchanged.” Zinke is now facing a swirl of misconduct allegations, and Trump has said he would make a decision on his future at the department as soon as this week. But whatever Zinke’s fate, he has stocked the department with a slate of committed conservative appointees who will continue to remake the agency in the image of the Trump administration. “They are undermining the department’s mission at every turn,” said one current high-level civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “I have been here a pretty long time and seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle,” the civil servant added, “but this is the worst I have ever seen.” During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump made no secret of his ambition to exploit the American landscape. “A Trump administration will develop an American first energy plan,” he said in a 2016 speech before the North Dakota Petroleum Council. “American energy dominance will be declared a strategic, economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.” The US controls enormous publicly owned energy resources, from the underwater oil wells of the Gulf of Mexico to the gas fields of North Dakota and the uranium deposits of Arizona. The interior department is the agency that decides who can drill and mine these riches. Zinke has styled himself, at least superficially, after Theodore Roosevelt, the progressive-era president who helped create America’s modern conservation system. But Zinke has veered sharply from Roosevelt’s legacy. Where Roosevelt created the nation’s first national monuments, Zinke drastically reduced the size of Bears Ears national monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Utah last year in what amounted to the largest rollback of protected public lands in American history. More broadly, over the last fiscal year, the department has sought to lease a stunning 12.8m acres of publicly-owned oil and gas parcels to private companies. And while Roosevelt railed against powerful special interests, Zinke has a cozy relationship with industry groups. The monument reductions occurred after Zinke was pressured by conservative groups such as the Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity and energy companies such as the uranium firm Energy Fuels Inc. In fact, during Zinke’s first 18 months in office he met repeatedly with oil and gas industry organizations that have collectively given him more than $110,000 in political contributions over the course of his career, according to a report from the Western Values Project. Zinke’s top deputies also have a close relationship with extractive industries. During their first year and a half on the job, just seven of Zinke’s high-level political appointees collectively participated in at least 280 meetings, calls or gatherings with fossil fuel corporations, mining companies or related advocacy groups, according to calendars obtained via public records requests and analyzed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard. Meetings with conservative ideological organizations, agricultural and timber groups, and corporate lobbying and law firms also appeared regularly on the officials’ calendars. These extractive interests had more than twice as much access as conservation NGOs, which obtained at least 115 meetings and calls with the seven officials within the same timeframe. At a private energy summit that took place in Washington DC last December, a Zinke appointee named Timothy Williams articulated the department’s pro-industry agenda, according to documentation of his remarks reported here for the first time. Williams dismissively characterized the approach taken by the administration of Barack Obama: “Anything you want to do on public land, they want to see what the carbon footprint is and what the social cost is.” Under Zinke, “we’re not looking at this”, he said. The new administration was instead focused on “economic impacts”. It was bent on changing “the mindset of the bureaucrats”. From the very beginning, however, Zinke’s interior appointees appear to have violated Trump’s own ethics directives intended to “drain the swamp”. According to rules put in place by the Trump administration, officials are supposed to be prohibited for a period of two years from the date of their appointment from having meetings with former employers, with few exceptions, and interior department guidelines recommend that officials take steps to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest when performing their official duties. Williams, for instance, previously worked for Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a Koch brothers-funded organization committed to combating government regulations of all kinds, including environmental protections. But soon after joining the department as the deputy director of the office of intergovernmental and external affairs, his office contacted AFP to hold a meeting, according to records obtained by the investigative group Documented. “Happy to meet to discuss partnering on shared priorities,” Chrissy Harbin, then the AFP vice-president, replied in an email. In another case, the political appointee Douglas Domenech met twice in April 2017 with representatives of his former employer, the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another Koch-linked conservative foundation. According to his work calendar, the subject of the meeting was a pair of active lawsuits the organization had filed against agencies within the interior department concerning endangered species and property rights – the meetings appear to be a glaring conflict of interest. Little more than six months after its meetings with Domenech, TPPF had what it described as a “major win” when it settled one of those lawsuits. There are “express prohibitions” on such meetings in the White House’s own ethics pledge, said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. “These high-level officials are supposed to be setting the tone for the entire department and this shows a complete disregard for the ethics rules put in place by the administration.” The Guardian and Pacific Standard have uncovered several instances in which interior department leadership has coordinated closely with industry-aligned groups on crucial legal and regulatory decisions, with profound consequences for efforts to combat climate change, wildlife management and other matters. Zinke’s department plays a major role in the regulation of methane which, for the first 20 years after it is introduced into the atmosphere, is over 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The interior department under Barack Obama moved to clamp down on a principal source of domestic methane pollution – the wasteful leaking, venting and flaring of methane by oil and gas companies. In late 2016, just before Obama left office, the interior department finalized a new federal regulation that required oil and gas drillers operating on public land to take stringent steps to detect and capture methane waste. Influential oil and gas industry trade groups like the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) were opposed to the measure, and sued in late 2016 to block what it considered a “regulatory onslaught on American producers”. During the first months of the Trump administration, Republicans led an industry-backed effort to repeal the methane rule using the Congressional Review Act, a law that enables Congress and the president to roll back recently issued regulations. It seems clear that the methane rule rollback was a foregone conclusion from day one The repeal effort soon ran into trouble, however, when Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, publicly came out against it in the spring of 2017. Emails reveal how the interior department and oil industry coordinated a response.  “Really?” wrote interior official Micah Chambers, in a frustrated March 2017 note to Ryan Ullman, the IPAA’s director of government relations, upon learning of Graham’s opposition. “I’m disappointed to put it very politely,” Ullman responded. Ullman asked whether the department would wheel out Zinke to make the case for getting rid of the regulation. Graham did not change his mind about the methane rule and the Senate ultimately voted against repealing the regulation. Zinke’s department soon took matters into its own hands. The department tried twice in 2017 to block methane regulation by itself, but both times it was stymied by legal challenges from environmentalist groups and state governments. A political appointee named Katharine MacGregor helped lead the department’s handling of the issue. Her calendar shows several meetings with fossil-fuel industry groups in the summer and fall of 2017, including one about methane just a few hours before an internal interior department meeting on the same subject. In September this year, MacGregor announced that the department had decided to rewrite the rule entirely, rather than merely block it. The revision effectively rolled it back. Chase Huntley, the energy and climate program director at The Wilderness Society, said his organization held several meetings with top interior officials, and it became apparent to him that their minds were already made up: the gutting of the methane rule was a preordained outcome. “It seems clear that the methane rule rollback, while arbitrary, was a foregone conclusion from day one of this administration,” he said. It was rooted “in a philosophical and policy allegiance to the industry’s best interests”. Extractive industries also seem to have had a hand in the department’s implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which is regarded as one of the strongest environmental laws in the world but is the bane of some industry groups because it limits development in sensitive habitat. The interior department energy counselor, Vincent DeVito, for instance, appears to have helped delay Endangered Species Act protections last year for an imperiled freshwater mussel species in Texas at the behest of oil and gas interests. In mid 2017, the government relations director for the Independent Petroleum Association of America wrote in an email to DeVito: “We really hope that you can intervene before this species gets listed next month.” When the species’ listing was delayed, the Guardian and Pacific Standard have learned from records, the IPAA sent DeVito an email with the words: “THANK YOU!” DeVito has since left the department to work for an oil and gas company. The department has taken a controversial stance, too, on sage grouse, a chicken-size bird that dwells among the sprawling sagebrush plains of the American west. Even the slightest disturbance can drive the animal from its breeding and nesting grounds, and populations have plummeted in recent decades as oil and gas drilling, mining and other development has fractured its habitat. In 2015, the Obama administration unveiled protection plans for the species, including a proposal to prohibit new mining on 10m acres of federal land in the hope of avoiding disturbance. But after Trump’s election, the mining industry suddenly found itself with committed sympathizers within the interior development. A striking email chain reviewed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard reveals that a mining industry advocate helped edit the wording of legislative language intended to block funding for these sage grouse conservation efforts. In one message from spring 2017, a Republican staffer with the Congressional Western Caucus named Jeff Small described producing the proposed text “after much discussion” with Laura Skaer, the executive director of the influential American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA). He sent an email to top officials at the interior department to run the legislative language past them too. Kathleen Benedetto, a senior adviser at the department, replied: “It will need to be modified.” That very day, a modified version of the language was suggested to a house committee by the Republican congressman Paul Gosar. (A spokesperson for Gosar said that “it is common for us to solicit feedback from outside experts and impacted stakeholders”.) The Republican-led Congress ultimately failed to block funding for the proposed mining prohibition, however, and Zinke’s department once again took matters into its own hands. In June 2017, Zinke established a broad internal review of the Obama-era sage grouse conservation plans, naming Benedetto, previously the co-founder of the Women’s Mining Coalition, as “co-lead” of the effort. Over the course of the next four months, Benedetto’s calendar shows she had at least 16 meetings or calls with mining groups. In October 2017, the Bureau of Land Management, which Benedetto helps oversee, announced that the 10m acres would no longer be out of bounds for mining. The AEMA celebrated the victory, saying the interior department “has done the right thing by ending this epic federal land grab”. Since taking office, Zinke and his department have been subject to no fewer than 15 federal investigations. The interior department’s office of inspector general is investigating his involvement in a Montana land deal with the chairman of the oil services company Halliburton. It is also looking into his role in blocking the development of a proposed casino involving two Native American tribes in Connecticut. In late October, the Washington Post reported that the inspector general’s office referred one of its inquiries to the justice department for further investigation, though it did not specify which one. The secretary’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda, his team’s conflict of interests problems, and his own personal conduct are likely to draw intense scrutiny from Democrats once they take control of the House in January 2019. Already, congressman Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who will probably take the reins as the chair of the House natural resources committee next year, has vowed to call Zinke before the committee in order to interrogate him about his “failures and scandals”. Whether Zinke sticks around at the department is an open question, though many press reports indicate that he is preparing to step down from office. His political appointees, nevertheless, will probably remain. But they too acknowledge that they have a short timeframe in which to finish their work of fulfilling Trump’s energy dominance agenda. At the private Washington DC energy summit back in December, Timothy Williams admitted as much to his audience of conservative operatives and fossil-fuel advocates. “Obviously we are not going as fast as everybody wants, but at some point there will be an administration in here, an administration that is not friendly to your values, to you guys,” he said. “So bear with us,” he added later. “You guys should know that if you have any questions or any problems you feel free to contact me. That is my job.

"I strongly agree with George’s Monbiot’s comments regarding David Attenborough’s latest BBC series, Dynasties (Attenborough has betrayed the living world that he loves, 7 November). Why have most of his wonderful programmes been blind to the tsunami of environmental destruction we have unleashed? Some years ago I confronted Alastair Fothergill, series producer of many of Attenborough’s programmes, at a public meeting: “The Earth is in distress: why do you ignore human impacts?” His response: “Our audience does not want to be disturbed.” What about the mess that future generations will be left with?  In the 1980s I worked at Channel 4 for Fragile Earth, which broadcast some 20 environmental documentaries a year. But as soon as Michael Grade took over as CEO in 1988, he sacked the commissioning editor – advertisers did not like disturbing programmes. And so the global devastation continues largely unreported in TV documentaries.  British TV has also systematically deprived us of information about solutions to the world’s environmental problems. In some countries, major new green industries are flourishing, but viewers in Britain are being left uninformed. We need well-presented programmes helping us to make the right decisions – as consumers, as parents and as voters. Herbert GirardetAuthor and consultant; co-founder, World Future Council • If David Attenborough is unwilling or unable to offer potential solutions to the world’s environmental crisis, perhaps the Guardian should invite those who may have solutions to offer these in a series of features with global mass-media and social-media partners. Contributors could include people who understand that population can be lowered and welfare improved by global development based on justice and greater power for women: there are many examples of this which expose the intellectual poverty of neo-Malthusians. It could include the ideas of economists who reject conventional “growth” as the only way forward. It might tap into the “feasible utopia” ideas of red-green media and thinktanks plus the work of academics who lead the search for sustainability. NGOs and unions could have a role, and there would be space for scientists – but not the Tomorrow’s World types who promised cosy technological fixes for all our problems, passifying a bedazzled public. We must tap into the mass of talented but largely unheard folk who have ideas that begin with the understanding that “another world is possible”.Trevor PhillipsNorwich • The BBC has been guilty of ignoring or dumbing down important information about climate for a long time. Many other organisations that should know better are also guilty of not shouting loud enough about the consequences of global warming: there has been consistent fear among NGOs that frightening people would have adverse effects. They are all complicit in this cover-up.Maureen EvershedDorridge, West Midlands • I couldn’t agree more with George Monbiot. We are not children; we do not need to be protected from the truth because it may make us uncomfortable. Our planet is on the cusp of a downward spiral leading to monumental disaster unless we all do something very quickly. And yet the BBC appears to be more interested in audience numbers, still determined to make safe, appealing programmes with David Attenborough at the helm. He is in an almost unique position to make a powerful statement about the remaining wonders, which still exist, but will most certainly disappear in the not too distant future. And with their disappearance our own species will surely not survive. My generation, and David Attenborough, will be long gone when what’s left of the Earth’s future population will be struggling to stay alive on a very bleak, barren and silent planet. Will they look back and be glad that we were entertained?Carol KnightTisbury, Wiltshire • I sympathise with the concern that George Monbiot expresses. I think there is a problem that people are liable to be put off by all the warnings of the disastrous consequences. It is very difficult to tread the right line between very bad predictions and reassuring us that something can be done. Avoiding single-use plastics is something people can easily aim for and feel that they are preventing a whale from being killed by plastic. I felt sad to see the recent pictures of all the plastic that one whale had ingested. Then I thought of all the creatures that will never be born because of climate change, and that is even more sad.Janet PoliakoffNottingham • Your excellent article reporting the devastating effects of humans on other animals illustrates how important it is to avoid further increasing our environmental footprint (Annihilation of wildlife a threat to civilisation, scientists warn, 30 October). A policy promoted by the Guardian, and supported by its readers, requires a huge increase in our environmental footprint: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. For example, the late David MacKay showed that in order to meet UK energy needs, solar, wind and biomass “farms’ would need to occupy 5%, 10% and 75 % of our available land area, respectively. The required offshore wind turbines would occupy an area equivalent to a 13km thick strip around the entire UK shore. Wave machines would need to stretch across the entire 500km Atlantic coastline. Can we reduce greenhouse gas emission without increasing our footprint on this planet? Yes, by exploiting the densest form of energy: nuclear. Although feared by the public, nuclear has the best safety record of all forms of energy, and is far safer than fossil fuel. Even the most catastrophic nuclear accidents, such as the ones at Chernobyl and Fukushima, eventually caused very few deaths (43 after Chernobyl and none at Fukushima).If we want to protect other species from humans and avoid catastrophic climate change, we need to shift our focus from renewables and expand nuclear energy.

"For the fourth-generation crab fisherman John Beardon, the warming of Pacific waters off the coast of California has meant toxic crabs, shortened fishing seasons and a near decimation of his livelihood as a crab boat captain. Now he would like to see the industry he says is responsible pay for the damage. On Wednesday, associations representing California crab fishermen like Beardon filed suit against 30 fossil fuel companies seeking to make the companies pay for the harm global warming has caused to California’s fisheries. The suit demands that petroleum interests finance the changes that will be needed to sustain the crab fishing industry in the future.  “We just about can’t make a living fishing crabs any more,” said Beardon, who has seen the earnings he can make with his 35ft crab boat, Stormy II, cut in half in recent years because of the effects of ocean warming. “I’d like to see the industry that caused this take responsibility for that.” The lawsuit, filed in California state superior court by the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, is the first legal action by a private industry group seeking to hold the fossil fuel companies responsible for major losses attributed to global warming. It seeks unspecified damages from defendants including Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP. The suit also names 27 other petroleum companies. “We’re taking a stand for the captains and crew, their families and the business owners that support the fleet,” said Noah Oppenheim, the association’s executive director. “The fossil fuel companies named in our lawsuit knowingly caused harm, and they need to be held accountable.” The suit follows a slew of legal actions filed in the last 18 months by government agencies, including the cities of New York City and San Francisco and the state of Rhode Island, claiming that the petroleum industry has long known about the devastating effects their products cause to the climate but has done little to stop them. In June, a federal court judge threw out two suits from the cities of San Francisco and Oakland. Judge William Alsup of the US district court for the northern district of California wrote in his ruling that while he accepted the science behind global warming, “the problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case”. He also cited the benefits that have come from petroleum products. Early this month, the US supreme court refused to stop a lawsuit brought by a group of children and young adults, which seeks to force the US government to do something about climate change. Another federal court recently paused the case after the Trump administration requested a temporary stay. The fishermen’s suit raises the question of who should have to bear the costs of financing the major adaptions that industry – and society – will have to make to survive global warming. “Defendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on Earth’s climate, including a warming of the oceans,” reads the suit. Yet “defendants concealed the dangers, sought to undermine public support for greenhouse gas regulation, and engaged in massive campaigns to promote the ever-increasing use of their products at ever greater volumes”. Chevron, which has a major refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, did not immediately return calls from the Guardian. But R Hewitt Pate, Chevron’s vice-president and general counsel, called for cooperation, not blame, after the dismissal of the San Francisco and Oakland cases in June. “Tackling the difficult international policy issues of climate change requires honest and constructive discussion,” he said. “Using lawsuits to vilify the men and women who provide the energy we all need is neither honest nor constructive.” Starting in 2015, crab fishermen have had to contend with dramatically shortened fishing seasons because the warming of ocean waters has caused huge algal blooms along the Pacific coast. The blooms were blamed for causing a buildup of a neurotoxin, domoic acid, in the crab population, making the crabs potentially poisonous to eat. The start of the 2015 crab season, usually in November, had to be pushed back until the following March. The season was shortened in 2016 and 2017 as well. This year, the crab season will be allowed to open as usual, on Thursday, but one section of the northern California coastline will be closed for fishing. The unpredictable and dramatically shortened seasons have taken a huge toll on the fleet of small fishing boats that usually supply a bounty of fresh Dungeness crab for the state’s restaurants and holiday tables. “For some of these fishermen, losing a season means having to sell the boat. And many of them did,” said Oppenheim of the disastrous 2015-16 season. “We’re talking about families having to go to the bread line.” In releasing the suit, the fishing association called for the petroleum companies to fund studies that will help crab fishermen survive ocean warming and suggested that money could be used to study new ways of making crab fishing viable, such as keeping crabs in holding tanks so that they could expel toxic acids. Beardon, who fishes for Dungeness out of Crescent City, California, said he has had to go to work as a logging truck driver during the summer months in order to sustain his family crabbing business. “The last three years have been really hard,” said Beardon, “Our community came together and held a fish fry to help our crew members. But fish fries and disaster relief are no solution to these closures we’re now seeing year after year after year.”"
"Six months ago, when I stood on this bridge over Waskerley beck, which flows from the head of the Tunstall valley, the reservoir that it supplies was brimful. A rapid thaw after late heavy snowfall, followed by torrential rain, had left a pair of great-crested grebes piling up water weeds in a desperate attempt to keep their nest site above rising flood water.  Today, after the driest summer I can remember, a third of what was 66 acres of deep water is still mud. The sluggish beck meanders through the sediment towards a shallow lake, its rate of flow akin to replenishing an empty swimming pool using an egg cup. It will take many weeks of heavy rain to recharge the groundwater in the surrounding fells to the point where a refilled reservoir will cascade over the dam wall spillway again. Tunstall reservoir, built in 1879 to store drinking water, is now relegated to the role of maintaining summer water flow in the River Wear, three miles downstream at Wolsingham. It has been stocked with rainbow trout and all summer they have become concentrated in a shrinking volume of water. I counted 12 fishermen this morning: only one was using a rod and line; six were cormorants and five were herons, taking full advantage of such easy feeding opportunities. The idiom “shooting fish in a barrel” came to mind. I walked home through Backstone Bank wood, ancient oak woodland on the eastern flank of the reservoir, across a wooden bridge over another stream, where the trickle of water barely disturbed the autumn leaves that spun down into its rocky bed. The morning’s climate change news had been of a Met Office report describing a pattern of wetter winters and longer, drier summers. The reservoir’s water level has sometimes been low in the past, but it seems likely that this year’s exceptional weather experience will become the new normal. I’ve known this secluded valley for most of my life, with its farms, fellsides, wetlands and woodlands, all interlinked. There is now a sense of urgency in appreciating the here and now, before too much changes too fast."

"“Wildfires don’t care about wealth or status,” began the New York Times this week, describing the celebrity homes obliterated by fire in California. But what the report didn’t add, leaving it instead to Neil Young’s website, was that climate change cares even less. As President Trump took time out of his busy schedule protecting his hair and insulting the French to blame poor forest management, Young laid it on the line: “As a matter of fact this is not a forest fire that rages on as I write this. We are vulnerable because of climate change.” In the early stages of the climate crisis, it often felt as if the opposite were true: floods, droughts and heatwaves were always somewhere else’s problem, usually the global south, where they could be chalked up to some pre-existing vulnerability, in a shoulder-shrugging: “OK, so earthquakes aren’t great, but if they’d had better building regulations …” Times moved on. This year, the global heatwave was so pronounced that even habitual climate sceptics – the Sun newspaper, for example – felt moved to point out that the world appeared to be on fire.  Yet nothing brings the environment closer to home than when it affects people who seem a world away, people such as Miley Cyrus and Cher, who you can’t imagine facing any problem more serious than which diamond shoes to pack. If they can’t escape this reality, then it must be real. Right? If Young was the first celebrity to explicitly name the new normal, there is a distinctive tone to most of the statements: an outpouring not of loss, but of care for the rest of the community, notably, those who have died; statements of gratitude to firefighters; a recognition of what is important – pets, loved ones and other people – versus what is not – bricks, mortar and money. Cyrus and her parter, Liam Hemsworth, have donated $500,000 (£384,000) to victims of the fire. I have no idea what that represents as a proportion of their wealth; still, it’s an unusual and laudable thing, if your first thought, in the face of the charred remains of everything you own, is to give more away. In short, this is a vivid inflection point in the world’s journey, like a public information film about climate change. If all the money in the world won’t protect you, what is the endpoint of any equation where profit is pitted against the environment? If every star’s first thought is of the people they love, and even Robin Thicke’s second thought is of people he only barely knows (“It’s a great community, it’s a community of wonderful people, a lot of parents whose kids go to the same school as my kid. It’s just devastating”), there is a parable here about priorities, and the hierarchy of needs, and the fundamental nourishment of the human spirit, and it’s delivered – unbelievably – by the people with the best tunes. The devil must be spitting feathers; he thought he had those guys sewn up. Climate-change denial is dangerous, not because it has major governments by the throat, but because it is shameless: it will reject the facts on a page, and the evidence before its own eyes. It will blame anyone but the real culprits, and marshal that blame to suit a narrative of scarcity and threat. But there does come a point when rhetoric runs out of road, is swallowed up by a more awesome spectacle; the authentic human response to the bite of a reality that can’t be denied for ever.  "
"It’s been a year of natural disasters. After Irma, Maria, Harvey, hurricane Florence left a devastating landscape in the Caribbean. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere have caused devastating fires from Europe to the US. Dozens have been killed in the Philippines after typhoon Mangkhut triggered landslides. And the worst consequences of climate change are yet to come.  It is a huge challenge for rich countries and for developing nations, a sisyphean task: how to collect enough revenue to respond to major catastrophes, while at the same time trying to lift billions of people out of poverty? Look at Indonesia. Disasters are a familiar tragedy in the world’s fourth most populous nation, with its thousands of islands across hundreds of miles of ocean. This should make disaster risk planning crucial. It is not the case, as the latest earthquake and tsunami showed. Reports revealed that parts of the tsunami alert system didn’t work. In some areas, there were no sirens at all. The death toll is still climbing. Indonesia is the largest economy in south-east Asia and is projected to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050, behind China, the US and the EU. However, this prediction depends on its capacity to secure sufficient public revenue. It is the only way to finance, for example, the preparation and maintenance of earthquake-resistant buildings and infrastructure and warning systems. Natural disasters tend to worsen economic inequality in already critical situations, such as that in Indonesia. While many have been lifted out of poverty in the past two decades, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown faster than in any other south-east Asian country. The government now has an ambitious medium term strategy to deal with wide wage disparities and dramatically unequal access to infrastructure, education and health services. Addressing all these challenges requires revenue. At an average of 17.6% of GDP, tax collection in the Asia-Pacific region is among the lowest in the world, a level regarded by experts as totally insufficient to achieve sustainable development goals. And with big companies paying less and less taxes, most governments have the same answer: austerity. In the past decade, the average corporate tax rate in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) region has fallen from 30 to 22%, reflecting global trends. While these lower tax rates may attract higher levels of foreign investment, they come at a very high price: less fiscal revenues means less money to construct vital public services and infrastructure, not to mention less money to prepare for the effects of natural disasters. The only winners in this race to the bottom are multinationals, which end up paying almost no taxes. Vito Tanzi, the former head of the IMF’s Tax Policy Division, has branded such tax-avoiding companies “fiscal termites” for eating away the foundations of tax systems around the world. In his recent book, Termites of the State, Tanzi acknowledges that while no fiscal house is fully insulated from these tax pests, developing countries – especially those with mineral resources – are particularly vulnerable. Developing economies such as Indonesia rely heavily on corporate income tax bases. The IMF reports that the revenue lost from tax evasion in developing countries is 1.3 times larger, as a share of GDP, than it is in advanced economies. It’s a tough fight that involves tackling power elites, overcoming deep institutional resistance, pursuing inclusive forms of growth, eliminating unacceptable levels of poverty and building quality health and education systems for all. But the fight back is underway. The global debate about the tax dodging behaviour of unscrupulous multinationals is beginning to pay dividends. Civil society campaigning has led to the creation of a template for country by country reporting which could eventually expose the scale of tax avoidance in the region. The Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), of which I am a member, is putting forward a bold agenda of international tax rules from a perspective of global public interest rather than advancing national corporate interest. In the last decade Indonesia has made great progress towards its sustainable development goals. What a tragedy it would be therefore if this emerging Asia-Pacific middle class fails to emerge because multinational companies continue to get away with dodging tax and ransacking these nations of their wealth. • Wayne Swan is the former treasurer and deputy prime minister of Australia and a member of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT)"
"Fifteen environmental protesters, who blocked the roads outside the Houses of Parliament in the first stage of an “escalating campaign of civil disobedience” have been arrested. More than 1,000 people from the newly formed Extinction Rebellion group issued a declaration of rebellion in London’s Parliament Square on Wednesday in an effort to draw attention to the unfolding climate emergency.  The group, that included families, pensioners and teenagers, then sat down in the road blocking traffic at one of London’s busiest intersections for more than two hours as speakers from different faiths, Green party politicians and journalists warned about the unravelling environmental crisis. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato told the crowd: “We are here because we have a deep love and spiritual connection to the planet. “We must rise up. When the law tells you to support something that your deep inner voice is fundamentally against, you should take non-violent direct action.” Other speakers included Guardian columnist George Monbiot and Green party MP Caroline Lucas. The protest came a day after a stark warning from scientists that humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970 – a level of extinction that experts warn threatens the future of human civilisation. And earlier this month the UN warned that there are only 12 years left to prevent climate catastrophe. Wednesday’s protest was due to be a symbolic start to a campaign of civil disobedience that organisers say will bring large parts of London to a standstill next month. The group had expected a few hundred people to turn up but more than 1,000 arrived and after a show of hands it was decided to block the road outside parliament. Some of those involved locked themselves together, while others linked arms as the police moved in. Felix, 28, was one of those who had chained himself to a fellow protester. He said the disruption, which saw parts of central London come to a standstill, was justified. “The disruption we are causing today is nothing to the destruction that our governments are unleashing by not taking serious steps to stop the ecological crisis. I have never been to prison before but I feel I have to try and do something.” The group is planning a campaign of mass civil disobedience starting next month and promises it has hundreds of people who are prepared to get arrested in an effort to draw attention to the unfolding climate emergency. It will culminate with a sit-in protest in Parliament Square on 17 November and a series of planned occupations of London bridges. The “rebellion” has been backed by almost 100 senior academics from across the UK, including Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury. In a letter published in the Guardian last week they said the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means “the ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.” Organisers said Wednesday’s turnout showed the strength of frustration and the desire to do something to tackle the ecological crisis. And they predicted widespread disruption next month. “People are no longer prepared to sit back and watch our politicians and corporations drive us off the cliff of ecological destruction,” said one of the organisers, Gail Bradbrook. “This is an emergency situation and it needs an emergency response.”"
"A rare sighting of sperm whales in the Canadian Arctic is the latest sign of a quickly changing ecosystem, say scientists, as a growing number of species expand their range into warming Arctic waters. Brandon Laforest, a marine biologist with the World Wildlife Fund, and guide Titus Allooloo were working on a project monitoring the effect of marine traffic on the region’s narwhal population when they spotted the pair of large whales just outside Pond Inlet, a community at the northern tip of Baffin Island in September. Video of the incident, released at the end of October, captures the second known sighting of sperm whales in the region. In 2014, hunters from Pond Inlet spotted them in the area. At first, Allooloo and Laforest thought the dark shapes in the water were killer whales – another species that has become a frequent visitor to the waters as temperatures creep up. But the distinct shape of the dorsal fin surprised Allooloo – a veteran hunter. “They’re not known by us, we don’t know too much about them,” Allooloo told the CBC. While a number of whales species thrive year-round in the Arctic, including beluga, bowhead and narwhal, the physiology of a sperm whale makes it difficult for them to navigate colder waters. Their heads and upper parts of the body are soft and contain an oily fat – long prized by whalers – that turns waxy in cold waters. Their bodies – which can weigh as much as 125,000lb (56,700kg) – are also ineffective at breaking through ice. While they don’t represent a threat to the ecosystem, there are worries sperm whale could become trapped as winter approaches. “Inexperienced whales exploiting a northern habitat may not know to leave early enough before the sea ice forms,” Laforest told the CBC. The vast area of the Arctic waters – estimated by Canadian researchers to measure 5.5m sq miles - makes it difficult for scientists to effectively track changes in the ecosystem, including the arrival of previously unreported species. Baseline datasets are also rare, making trend gathering difficult. Increasingly, researchers are working with Inuit communities, which have a long oral history of species in the region. In recent years, killer whales, or orcas, have also become more frequent in a number, taking advantage of longer ice-free seasons. The whales, which feast on resident narwhal, have even started changing narwhal behaviour, according to a 2017 report by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. “I think the narwhal are scared to death,” report co-author Steve Ferguson told the Canadian Press. “Watching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.” A recent presentation by the department also highlighted a spike in chum salmon populations the western Arctic – in numbers far greater than previously recorded. Warming temperatures have also prompted interest in the potential for expanded commercial fishing in the Arctic. In response, nine countries have agreed to ban fishing in the region until a more thorough study of the ecosystem can be completed."

"Spain has launched an ambitious plan to switch its electricity system entirely to renewable sources by 2050 and completely decarbonise its economy soon after. By mid-century greenhouse gas emissions would be slashed by 90% from 1990 levels under Spain’s draft climate change and energy transition law.  To do this, the country’s social democratic government is committing to installing at least 3,000MW of wind and solar power capacity every year in the next 10 years ahead. New licences for fossil fuel drills, hydrocarbon exploitation and fracking wells, will be banned, and a fifth of the state budget will be reserved for measures that can mitigate climate change. This money will ratchet upwards from 2025. Christiana Figueres, a former executive secretary of the UN’s framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), hailed the draft Spanish law as “an excellent example of the Paris agreement”. She added: “It sets a long-term goal, provides incentives on scaling up emissions technologies and cares about a good transition for the workforce.” Under the plan, “just transition” contracts will be drawn up, similar to the £220m package announced in October, that will shut most Spanish coalmines in return for a suite of early retirement schemes, re-skilling in clean energy jobs, and environmental restoration. These deals will be partly financed by auction returns from the sale of emissions rights. The government has already scrapped a controversial “sun tax” that halted Spain’s booming renewables sector earlier this decade, and the new law will also mandate a 35% electricity share for green energy by 2030. James Watson, chief executive of the SolarPower Europe trade association, said the law was “a wake-up call to the rest of the world”. Energy efficiency will also be improved by 35% within 11 years, and government and public sector authorities will be able to lease only buildings that have almost zero energy consumption. Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, and former French climate envoy who helped draft the Paris accord, described the agreement as groundbreaking and inspirational. “By planning on going carbon neutral, Spain shows that the battle against climate change is deadly serious, that they are ready to step up and plan to reap the rewards of decarbonisation,” she said. However, the government’s hold on power is fragile. With just a quarter of parliamentary seats it will depend on the more leftwing Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos parties to pass the climate plan. No dates were included in the legislation for phaseouts of coal or nuclear energy, and a ban on new cars with petrol or diesel engines was delayed until 2040."
"A milestone plan to impose America’s first ever price on carbon pollution failed to win enough votes in Washington state, on a tough night for environmentalists who had pinned their hopes on a number of climate change-related ballot measures across the country. A majority of Washington state voters in the midterm elections rejected a measure, known as Initiative 1631, that would have put a $15 fee on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted in the state, with the funds used to bolster various renewable energy projects. It is the third time an attempt to implement carbon pricing has been thwarted in Washington, a progressive state in the Pacific north-west with just one, soon-to-close coal power plant and a glut of hydroelectricity. The glaring ballot failure threatens prospects of moving quickly enough to avert disastrous climate change. “It’s a setback because nothing really happens at a federal level until it happens in the states – just look at gay marriage,” said Heidi Peltier, an expert in low-carbon policy at the University of Massachusetts. “If we are going to have a carbon tax nationally, we need to have enough states doing it. Washington state had a chance to be one of the leaders.” Carbon pricing has been backed by a broad range of economists as the most efficient way of driving down emissions, with the European Union and, more recently, Canada, embracing the idea. A recent UN report, which warned of dire consequences if planetary warming isn’t urgently curbed, suggested a fee much higher than $15 a ton. Initiative 1631, which followed a similar ballot measure that failed two years ago, aimed to raise $2.2bn over five years and help Washington slash its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter by 2025.  However, voters rejected the initiative because “they understood it was a flawed initiative that would have raised consumer costs substantially while doing very little to meet carbon reduction goals in the state”, according to Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, which spearheaded the no vote. Oil giant BP and others spent $30m opposing carbon pricing. Environmentalists vowed to persevere. “While we still believe that a carbon fee would be a helpful solution, we can and must do more to find and adopt other creative solutions to slow global warming,” said Bruce Speight, director of Environment Washington. A spokesman for the yes on the 1631 campaign said the group hadn’t conceded defeat yet.  “The oil industry spent the most money in our state’s history and were willing to lie to voters about their support and mislead them on the facts,” he said. The Washington vote was just one green-tinged measure rejected by voters. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent more than $40m to help defeat a proposal requiring oil and gas wells to be half a mile from homes, schools and waterways. Meanwhile, Arizona voters said no to Proposition 127, which would have mandated the state obtain half its energy needs from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030.  Climate activists enjoyed a win in Florida, however, with voters backing a ban on all offshore drilling for oil and gas in state waters.  There was further encouragement for environmentalists at the prospect of a Democrat-held House of Representatives probing the activity of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Interior, as well as the election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Deb Haaland and Ilhan Omar – all House Democrats who favour a transition to 100% renewable energy. The current Democratic leadership is not, however, understood to have large-scale plans to tackle the climate change crisis. And the midterms highlighted the ongoing clout of the fossil fuel industry and the vast gulf between the current slow pace of emissions reduction and the action that scientists say is required to stave off the worst impacts of heatwaves, flooding, extreme weather and losses of animal species. “Environmentalists still have a challenge in their messaging, there’s still the impression that carbon pricing or regulations will make everything more expensive,” said Peltier. “Oil, gas and coal can put a lot of money into ballot initiatives they see as detrimental to their future and put out information on climate change that isn’t real. There’s a real disparity there.” Environmental advocates at a post-election press conference in Washington DC, largely claimed victory as Democrats won back the House and many governors pledged to phase out fossil fuels, but they acknowledged they are still in an uphill battle. “We didn’t win everywhere, and we know that,” said Wendy Wendlandt, senior vice-president for the Environment America Action Fund. “I think that’s on us as the environmental community to figure out how to connect the concern we know exists with environmental voters at the ballot box.” “It is true that we have been able to make progress over the last couple years,” said the Sierra Club executive director, Mike Brune, noting environmental successes. “But it is also true that we are in a fight. We are in a bitter fight, a divisive fight.” Tom Steyer, the California billionaire whose group financed the Arizona renewable power measure, said Democrats can’t wait for Republicans to come to the table as the science shows a need for immediate action. “If we want to succeed by 2030, it is completely unclear to me that there are Republicans that are willing to compromise on this,” Steyer said. "
"Woodside Petroleum chief executive, Peter Coleman, has joined mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto in calling for a price on carbon to help with emissions reduction targets and the transition to renewable energy. But the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has claimed Australia doesn’t need a carbon price as emissions levels are coming down – a position at odds with the government’s official emissions data and independent modelling. He also claimed the companies would benefit economically from putting a higher price on carbon – but has not put forward any evidence to support that claim. “There is almost no other country in the world that has the credentials of Australia in reducing carbon emissions,” Taylor told ABC radio on Wednesday. “We are bringing emissions down, and we’re doing extremely well.” The latest government data showed overall greenhouse gas emissions climbed 1.3%, to their highest quarterly levels in eight years. Woodside Petroleum had been an outspoken opponent of carbon pricing under Julia Gillard’s former Labor government. However, its current chief, Coleman, says investors are increasingly concerned about the company’s sustainability measures, and the issue should be dealt with through an appropriate global approach. “We need a price on carbon. We need to ensure the most effective energy gets into the system,” he told the ABC on Tuesday evening. “We don’t want to have perversive outcomes where lowest-cost energy suppliers are competing against renewables, and we end up in a situation where we’ve invested a lot in renewables but in fact see no benefit from a carbon point of view.” Industries such as shipping need to be incentivised to transition to cleaner energy, he added. “If you believe in the science or not really doesn’t matter,” Coleman said. “By the time the science is proven, it will be too late to act. So it’s prudent to act today.”"
"It’s not about “them”, it’s about us. The horrific rate of biological annihilation reported this week – 60% of the Earth’s vertebrate wildlife gone since 1970 – is driven primarily by the food industry. Farming and fishing are the major causes of the collapse of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Meat – consumed in greater quantities by the rich than by the poor – is the strongest cause of all. We may shake our heads in horror at the clearance of forests, the drainage of wetlands, the slaughter of predators and the massacre of sharks and turtles by fishing fleets, but it is done at our behest. As the Guardian’s recent report from Argentina reveals, the huge forests of the Gran Chaco are heading towards extermination as they are replaced by deserts of soya beans, almost all of which are used to produce animal feed, particularly for Europe. With Jair Bolsonaro in power in Brazil, deforestation in the Amazon is likely to accelerate, much of it driven by the beef lobby that helped bring him to power. The great forests of Indonesia, such as those in West Papua, are being felled and burned for oil palm at devastating speed.  The most important environmental action we can take is to reduce the area of land and sea used by farming and fishing. This means, above all, switching to a plant-based diet: research published in the journal Science shows that cutting out animal products would reduce the global requirement for farmland by 76%. It would also give us a fair chance of feeding the world. Grass-fed meat, contrary to popular belief, is no alternative: it is an astonishingly wasteful use of vast tracts of land that would otherwise support wildlife and wild ecosystems. The same action is essential to prevent climate breakdown. Because governments, bowing to the demands of capital, have left it so late, it is almost impossible to see how we can stop more than 1.5C of global warming without drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The only way of doing it that has been demonstrated at scale is to allow trees to return to deforested land. But could we go beyond even a plant-based diet? Could we go beyond agriculture itself? What if, instead of producing food from soil, we were to produce it from air? What if, instead of basing our nutrition on photosynthesis, we were to use electricity to fuel a process whose conversion of sunlight into food is 10 times more efficient? This sounds like science fiction, but it is already approaching commercialisation. For the past year, a group of Finnish researchers has been producing food without either animals or plants. Their only ingredients are hydrogen-oxidising bacteria, electricity from solar panels, a small amount of water, carbon dioxide drawn from the air, nitrogen and trace quantities of minerals such as calcium, sodium, potassium and zinc. The food they have produced is 50% to 60% protein; the rest is carbohydrate and fat. They have started a company (Solar Foods) that seeks to open its first factory in 2021. This week it was selected as an incubation project by the European Space Agency. They use electricity from solar panels to electrolyse water, producing hydrogen, which feeds bacteria that turn it back into water. Unlike other forms of microbial protein (such as Quorn), it requires no carbohydrate feedstock – in other words, no plants. Perhaps you are horrified by this prospect. Certainly, there’s nothing beautiful about it. It would be hard to write a pastoral poem about bacteria grazing on hydrogen. But this is part of the problem. We have allowed a mythical aesthetic to blind us to the ugly realities of industrial agriculture. Instilled with an image of farming that begins in infancy – about half the books for very small children involve a rosy-cheeked farmer with one cow, one horse, one pig and one chicken, living in bucolic harmony – we fail to see the amazing cruelty of large-scale animal farming. The blood and gore, filth and pollution. We fail to apprehend the mass clearance of land required to feed us. The Insectageddon caused by pesticides; the drying up of rivers; the loss of soil; the reduction of the magnificent diversity of life on Earth to a homogeneous grey waste. The compound the Finnish researchers have produced from air, water and electricity is most likely to be used as a bulk ingredient in processed food. But (though this goes well beyond the company’s current plans) is there any reason why, with modifications of the process, it could not start to deliver the proteins required to make cultured meat, or the oils that could render palm plantations redundant? Is there any reason why it should not eventually replace much of what we eat? According to the researchers’ estimates, 20,000 times less land is required for their factories than is needed to produce the same amount of food by growing soya. Cultivating all the protein the world now eats with their technique would require an area smaller than Ohio. The best places to do it are deserts, where solar energy is most abundant. When electricity can be generated at €15 (£13) a megawatt hour (a few years hence), their process becomes cost-competitive with the cheapest source of soya. Could a similar technique also be used to produce cellulose and lignin, eventually replacing the need for commercial forestry? Is there any inherent reason why the hydrogen pathway could not create as many products as photosynthesis does today? Could it help to change our entire relationship with the natural world, reducing our footprint to a fraction of its current size? There are plenty of questions to be answered, plenty of possible hurdles and constraints. But think of the possibilities. Agricultural commodities, currently using almost all the Earth’s fertile land area, could be shrunk into a few small pockets of infertile land. The potential for ecological restoration is astonishing. The potential for feeding the world, a question that has literally been keeping me awake at night, is just as electrifying. None of this means we can afford to relax and wait for an infant technology to save us. In the meantime, as urgent intermediate steps, we should switch to a plant-based diet and mobilise against the destruction of the living planet. You could start by joining the Extinction Rebellion movement, which launches today. But if this works, it could help – alongside political mobilisation – to change almost everything. Places that have become agricultural deserts, trashed by giant corporations, could be reforested, drawing carbon dioxide from the air on a vast scale. The ecosystems of land and sea could recover, not just in pockets but across great tracts of the planet. A new age of global hunger becomes less likely. Crude and destructive technologies got us into this mess; refined technologies can help get us out of it. The struggle to save every possible species and ecosystem from the current wave of destruction is worthwhile. One day, perhaps within our lifetimes, they could repopulate a thriving world. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"It was a moment of the kind that changes lives. At a press conference held by climate activists Extinction Rebellion last week, two of us journalists pressed the organisers on whether their aims were realistic. They have called, for example, for UK carbon emissions to be reduced to net zero by 2025. Wouldn’t it be better, we asked, to pursue some intermediate aims? A young woman called Lizia Woolf stepped forward. She hadn’t spoken before, but the passion, grief and fury of her response was utterly compelling. “What is it that you are asking me as a 20-year-old to face and to accept about my future and my life? … This is an emergency. We are facing extinction. When you ask questions like that, what is it you want me to feel?” We had no answer. Softer aims might be politically realistic, but they are physically unrealistic. Only shifts commensurate with the scale of our existential crises have any prospect of averting them. Hopeless realism, tinkering at the edges of the problem, got us into this mess. It will not get us out. Public figures talk and act as if environmental change will be linear and gradual. But the Earth’s systems are highly complex, and complex systems do not respond to pressure in linear ways. When these systems interact (because the world’s atmosphere, oceans, land surface and lifeforms do not sit placidly within the boxes that make study more convenient), their reactions to change become highly unpredictable. Small perturbations can ramify wildly. Tipping points are likely to remain invisible until we have passed them. We could see changes of state so abrupt and profound that no continuity can be safely assumed. Only one of the many life support systems on which we depend – soils, aquifers, rainfall, ice, the pattern of winds and currents, pollinators, biological abundance and diversity – need fail for everything to slide. For example, when Arctic sea ice melts beyond a certain point, the positive feedbacks this triggers (such as darker water absorbing more heat, melting permafrost releasing methane, shifts in the polar vortex) could render runaway climate breakdown unstoppable. When the Younger Dryas period ended 11,600 years ago, temperatures rose 10C within a decade. I don’t believe such a collapse is yet inevitable, or that a commensurate response is either technically or economically impossible. When the US joined the second world war in 1941, it replaced a civilian economy with a military economy within months. As Jack Doyle records in his book Taken for a Ride, “In one year, General Motors developed, tooled and completely built from scratch 1,000 Avenger and 1,000 Wildcat aircraft … Barely a year after Pontiac received a navy contract to build anti-shipping missiles, the company began delivering the completed product to carrier squadrons around the world.” And this was before advanced information technology made everything faster. The problem is political. A fascinating analysis by the social science professor Kevin MacKay contends that oligarchy has been a more fundamental cause of the collapse of civilisations than social complexity or energy demand. Control by oligarchs, he argues, thwarts rational decision-making, because the short-term interests of the elite are radically different to the long-term interests of society. This explains why past civilisations have collapsed “despite possessing the cultural and technological know-how needed to resolve their crises”. Economic elites, which benefit from social dysfunction, block the necessary solutions. The oligarchic control of wealth, politics, media and public discourse explains the comprehensive institutional failure now pushing us towards disaster. Think of Donald Trump and his cabinet of multi-millionaires; the influence of the Koch brothers in funding rightwing organisations; the Murdoch empire and its massive contribution to climate science denial; or the oil and motor companies whose lobbying prevents a faster shift to new technologies. It is not just governments that have failed to respond, though they have failed spectacularly. Public sector broadcasters have systematically shut down environmental coverage, while allowing the opaquely funded lobbyists that masquerade as thinktanks to shape public discourse and deny what we face. Academics, afraid to upset their funders and colleagues, have bitten their lips. Even the bodies that claim to be addressing our predicament remain locked within destructive frameworks. Last Wednesday I attended a meeting about environmental breakdown at the Institute for Public Policy Research. Many people in the room seemed to understand that continued economic growth is incompatible with sustaining the Earth’s systems. As the author Jason Hickel points out, a decoupling of rising GDP from global resource use has not happened and will not happen. While 50bn tonnes of resources used per year is roughly the limit the Earth’s systems can tolerate, the world is already consuming 70bn tonnes. At current rates of economic growth, this will rise to 180bn tonnes by 2050. Maximum resource efficiency, coupled with massive carbon taxes, would reduce this at best to 95bn tonnes: still way beyond environmental limits. Green growth, as members of the institute appear to accept, is physically impossible. Yet on the same day, the same institute announced a major new economics prize for “ambitious proposals to achieve a step-change improvement in the growth rate”. It wants ideas that will enable economic growth rates in the UK at least to double. The announcement was accompanied by the usual blah about sustainability, but none of the judges of the prize has a discernible record of environmental interest. Those to whom we look for solutions trundle on as if nothing has changed. As if the accumulating evidence has no purchase on their minds. Decades of institutional failure ensures that only “unrealistic” proposals – the repurposing of economic life, with immediate effect – now have a realistic chance of stopping the planetary death spiral. And only those who stand outside the failed institutions can lead this effort. Two tasks need to be performed simultaneously: throwing ourselves at the possibility of averting collapse, as Extinction Rebellion is doing, slight though this possibility may appear; and preparing ourselves for the likely failure of these efforts, terrifying as this prospect is. Both tasks require a complete revision of our relationship with the living planet. Because we cannot save ourselves without contesting oligarchic control, the fight for democracy and justice and the fight against environmental breakdown are one and the same. Do not allow those who have caused this crisis to define the limits of political action. Do not allow those whose magical thinking got us into this mess to tell us what can and cannot be done. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"David Attenborough is probably guilty of assuming that his viewers will usually be intelligent enough to join the dots and work out for themselves the implications of what he shows them (George Monbiot: Attenborough has betrayed the living world he loves, 7 November). The people who have a much more serious responsibility for the threadbare coverage the BBC has given to climate change and other environmental crises are the editors who for many years refused to treat climatology as a serious branch of science, and whose notion of “balance” led them to insist on equal airtime for people who, for whatever reason, have denied and often sought to discredit the scientists who say human activities are warming the Earth.Alex KirbyBBC News environment correspondent, 1987-1996 • In David Attenborough’s Dynasty programme he pointedly emphasised the diminishing number of chimpanzees and the threat that gold mining poses.
