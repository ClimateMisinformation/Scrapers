"Australia has come third last in an annual assessment of 58 nations’ climate policies, with only Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan ranking worse. The assessment by Germanwatch and Climate Action Network Europe was released at the Paris climate summit, just one day after foreign minister Julie Bishop told the assembled ministers Australia was meeting and beating its climate targets and transforming its energy production. The report measures actual emission levels per capita, the trend in emissions projections, the deployment of renewable energy, and the energy intensity of the economy, and assesses climate policies for each of the 58 countries. Australia’s score is slightly better than last year, but not enough to shift it very far up the rankings. The Australian Conservation Foundation acted as one of the “expert advisers” for the review, and its chief executive, Kelly O’Shannassy, said the study showed up the difference between what Australia was saying at the Paris conference and what it was doing. “This report cuts through the government’s spin to show that we are a climate laggard,” she said. Denmark topped the ranking, while the UK, Sweden, Belgium and France all scored well. Japan and Korea ranked only slightly higher than Australia. Australia’s high per capita emissions means it scores very badly in the first category of the assessment – measuring emissions levels. It scores better, although not well, in a second category assessing projected future emissions across a number of sectors. It also scores poorly on renewable energy deployment, where other countries are moving faster, and on both national and international climate policy. The expert comments would have contributed to the negative assessment. A selection are printed in the report, including: The report was finalised before the recent change of prime minister and does not appear to reflect what many negotiators believe is a more positive attitude by Australia in Paris. It says Australia’s record at global climate talks in recent years has been “poor” and that Australia tried to “relegate climate change off the agenda” in the leadup to the G20 meeting in Brisbane. “Experts criticise that Australia’s attitude appeared to be to try to avoid making any substantive commitments, and to do the absolute minimum that it has to. There appeared to be no recognition of Australia’s national interest in minimising climate change; rather, the focus seems to be on protecting domestic energy and resource exporters (coal and gas industry),” it says. The UK moved up the rankings, from six to five, because it has continued to expand renewable energy and set a deadline for phasing out coal-fired power. Indonesia also moved up, despite rampant illegal deforestation, because it has low per capita emissions and – according to the report – “improvements can be seen in the renewable and the efficiency scores”."
"The climate change talks going on in Paris are too dominated by men, to the detriment of effective action on saving people from the ravages of global warming, the UN’s special envoy on climate change has said. Mary Robinson, the former UN human rights chief and Ireland’s first female president, told the Guardian in an interview: “This is a very male world [at the conference]. When it is a male world, you have male priorities.”  She pointed to the line-up of ministers now leading the talks, few of whom are women. “If you don’t have women here, how can you say this is about people?” Tuesday was officially designated as “gender day” at the fortnight-long talks, which began nine days ago.  At Paris, governments are meeting in the hope of signing a new global agreement on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, which would kick in from 2020 when current commitments expire. It is seen as the last chance for the UN negotiations, which have been carrying on since 1992. “We have to humanise this, we need to send a strong message that this is about people. We need to have legal text on human rights and gender equality,” said Robinson. “Women in developing countries are among the most vulnerable to climate change.” Of the talks, she said: “There is a tendency to think that this is not a place for women, and we have to resist that. I have heard women here saying they feel strange to be here. Women have to be here in large numbers, to have critical mass.” She added: “Climate change is affecting the most vulnerable people around the world, and they are not the cause of it. This is at the heart of the future for all women, for all people.” Some countries are understood to be opposed to including language on gender equality in the text, including middle eastern countries. The UK, US and EU have said they support the inclusion of such terms. Climate change, Robinson warned, would prove a “serious disruption to social order” if allowed to go unchecked. The mass migration of people afflicted by warming, which is likely to render swathes of the globe virtually uninhabitable if temperature rises continue, would have a huge impact. “We are not handling migration well,” she said, referring to the crises provoked by the mass movement of people from Syria, north Africa and across the region, which she said would be worsened by climate change. “We need to change our whole approach to it.” Robinson said that a climate deal in Paris, if struck, would not be the end of the story. More work would need to be done on ensuring regular reviews of countries’ commitments on emissions and on finance for the poorest nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. “I know we can’t get it all done in Paris.” She said that climate change should not be seen in isolation, but alongside economic development for the world’s poor, which she hopes will be fostered by the UN’s sustainable development goals. “From the first of January 2016, I hope we will be starting a new era of sustainable development. It will not be perfect, but every country has to strive to get there.” As developed countries sought to gather together a “coalition of ambition”, including some of the biggest developed countries and some of the smallest developing nations, to strike a deal, Robinson said: “There is more ambition from developing countries [than the rich world] – that’s the sad lesson to the rich world.” Robinson said that some women had been excluded from the talks, having failed to get the badge needed to enter the high-security compound. She was in touch with some of them, communicating the goings-on in the negotiations, she said."
"The BBC has been reprimanded for a “serious” breach of rules on impartiality and accuracy over a Radio 4 show that featured climate sceptics mocking the science behind global warming.  The episode of What’s the Point of..., presented by Daily Mail columnist Quentin Letts, focused on the Met Office, which backs the opinion of the majority of the world’s scientists that climate change is being caused by human activity.   It included a number of statements suggesting that the Met’s stance was controversial, referred to the “climate change theory” and called it a “fiction”.  The BBC Trust said the show had failed to provide a balanced view of the debate around climate change, and had featured interviews with well known climate sceptics without adequately explaining that their views were not representative.  Guests included Peter Lilley MP, Graham Stringer MP, forecaster Piers Corbyn and Andy Silvester from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, all of whom have questioned the widely accepted science behind climate change.  The Met’s response was confined to a short clip from the organisation’s head of communications, Helen Chivers, which did not address the show’s critique of climate change research. The BBC Trust report said the programme had “failed to make clear that the Met Office’s underlying views on climate change science were supported by the majority of scientists” and that “audiences were not given sufficient information about prevailing scientific opinion to allow them to assess the position of the Met Office and the Met Office position on these criticisms was not adequately included in the programme”.  A section of the report contributed by the BBC executive said that the mistakes were in part due to a heavy workload and inexperienced production staff. A decision at a meeting early on in the commissioning process not to discuss climate change was not recorded properly and later ignored, it added. The BBC had previously acknowledged the failings and issued an apology in October. Radio 4 spokesperson said: “Radio 4 referred this programme to the trust given its shortcomings and we note that the trustees agree that this episode broke the editorial guidelines. We have already taken steps internally to avoid similar mistakes happening again and we apologise for the editorial failings in this programme.” The trust said the show should not be broadcast again and, due to the seriousness of the breach, should not be made available online."
"A decline in wildlife is threatening core functions of the ecosystem that are vital for human wellbeing, researchers behind an unprecedented study of biodiversity in the UK have warned. Climate change and habitat loss are leading to a reduction in biodiversity, with species that act as pollinators and natural pest controls most at risk, the study in the journal Nature Communications shows.  Hedgehogs, hoverflies, moths and birds are among the groups in most serious decline, with individual species under particular threat including the common red ant, red shanked carder bee and the common banded hoverfly. The findings are based on what is believed to be the biggest analysis of British wildlife ever conducted, with researchers from the University of Reading and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology looking at records covering 4,424 species, collected between 1970 and 2009.  Wildlife, trees and plants were analysed according to five functions they performed in the ecosystem: pollination, pest control, decomposition, carbon sequestration and species often recognised as being of cultural value, which included species such as birds, butterflies and bees. Among species considered pollinators – such as bees, moths and hoverflies – 28% are in decline, while 16% of those that act as natural pest controllers, such as ants and ground beetles, have witnessed significant losses.  Although some native species are increasing, along with some new species that have appeared in the UK, they do not offset the losses caused by the drop in wildlife performing the functions of pollination and pest control. Dr Tom Oliver, an ecologist at the University of Reading who led the study, told the Guardian that continued losses among wildlife performing those functions would lead to significant rises in the price of food, with some food groups likely to become unavailable. “Under current trends we are moving towards the loss of species and the ecosystem functions that are vital for human wellbeing, especially pollination and pest control,” he said.  “We need insects to pollinate our crops – we can’t do it by hand – and if we lose natural pest controls, less food will be available. If we lose those functions, the crops we eat won’t be able to be pollinated so the price of food would go hugely up and certain foods we wouldn’t be able to eat such as fruits including strawberries, raspberries and apples.” Species that support decomposition, carbon sequestration and that are considered to be of cultural value are at less risk, with 8%, 10% and 14% in those respective groups in decline. And some species such as the silver birch tree and the large black ant have shown significant rises.  But Oliver warned that further declines in biodiversity across all five functions driven by intensive farming and urbanisation could lead to “potentially catastrophic and irreversible impacts on human wellbeing”. “Climate change would be much more rapid, we would struggle to find food and would be knee deep in waste. We can either carry on the trajectory we are on and face huge costs in the future and potentially catastrophic impacts on human wellbeing, or we can pay costs now to mitigate those impacts,” he said.  The research builds upon on evidence collected in the 2013 landmark State of Nature report, which analysed fewer species but over a longer period of time, revealing that most UK species are in decline and that one in 10 are at risk of extinction.  Conservation organisations responded to the findings two months ago by calling on the government to produce a long-term strategy for how it will offset the impacts of decades of intensive farming and building on nature, including the effects on human health. Paul Wilkinson from the Wildlife Trust, which helped to compile the State of Nature report, said: “This latest shocking barometer of the state of our natural environment highlights the urgent need to halt the loss of our precious wild heritage for its own sake, but also for our future prosperity and survival.  “Nature underpins our economy, health and wellbeing. The government has an opportunity, with its 25-year Plan for Nature to stop the loss of our wildlife and secure its recovery within a generation. It’s vital that we all hold it to this task.” In order to mitigate the impact of decline in species, the government should introduce regulation to ringfence wildlife habitats from farming practices, or prevent the use of “the most harmful” pesticides, said Oliver. But recent cuts to environmental budgets make the situation more challenging. “The cuts are potentially very worrying, even under the previous level of funding we are already seeing historic documented biodiversity declines. With further cuts one can only imagine that the situation will get worse,” he said. “The government needs to more adequately recognise the value of the natural environment and put it on a equal footing with other demands such as energy and transport and housing. Those things are very apparent in that we can see a lack of housing, but the potential consequences of the decline in biodiversity are hidden.” The researchers believe the new study to be the most comprehensive of its kind in the world, made possible by data collected for nearly 40 years by thousands of trained volunteers."
"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has launched a war on deforestation, the country’s foreign minister said at the Paris climate talks, pledging to “actively engage” in global environment efforts. The reclusive country is among the 195 nations gathered in the French capital to craft a deal aimed at curbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are pushing climate change.  Kim “has declared war on deforestation and has put forward a massive project to turn all the mountains of the country into mountains of gold, thickly wooded with trees,” Ri Su-yong told delegates. Ri said the country would complete a large-scale tree-planting initiative over the next decade, which will help the “national effort to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions”. He said North Korea had the “aim of reducing the country’s total amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 37.4% compared with the levels of the 1990s. North Korean carbon emissions plummeted in the 1990s as its economy collapsed, but have crept slowly back up in recent years. The government “will continue to faithfully discharge its responsibilities as a party to UNFCCC and actively engage itself in international efforts to protect the global environment,” said Ri. The UNFCCC is the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, established 1992 as the main international arena for addressing global warming and its impacts."
"As the Paris talks draw to a close, there has been late flourish of artistic and cultural response to the potentially catastrophic threat of climate change. Some works are shouts of outrage, or attempt simply to make us connect with the reality of global warming. Others are of a more ambitious bent, seeking to be part of the solution by actively bringing people together to reimagine how we live in the world.  The campaigning work of the Beehive Collective, a volunteer-driven arts organisation in Paris for the festival of economic alternatives, has more in common with the medieval artisans who made the Bayeux tapestry than the fashionable but fleeting clicktivism of the age.  Two huge images, extraordinary in their detail, were inked by 20 artists from South and North America across nine painstaking years. Strung up between Parisian trees, they depict a kind of heaven and hell for the future development of Mesoamerica, depending on which pathways are chosen.  Subverting the style of old colonial maps, Plan Mesoamerica depicts a future of rapacious, financially-driven exploitation, one that continues across the regions even as the climate worsens, crushing local cultures and ecosystems. A scroll reads: ”Every time history repeats itself the price goes up.”  Mesoamerica is fighting back! turns the story around, reimagining the future of South and North America as a celebration of indigenous culture and ecological flourishing. Look closely and you’ll find depictions of more than 400 insect, plant, and animal species native to somewhere between Mexico and Colombia. These are more than illustrations or simple agitprop. The works, developed following long conversations with local communities, are designed to be used as a basis for the collective mapping of different, better development paths. As the collective writes, the two pieces show “stories of grassroots organising and community resilience”, in which “a multitude of characters symbolise strategies and tactics for building and defending autonomy”. The Danish artist Jens Galschiot has exhibited a number of installations around Paris over the duration of the talks. His work can be seen as an attempt to simplify the complex issue of “loss and damage”, a subject that has divided the global north and south.  The north has made the greater historical contribution to the emissions causing global warming. It has also shown rising antipathy towards migrants and refugees, who are likely to increase in number as a result of climate change. Yet northern governments have been slow to accept any financial responsibility for the harm caused by emissions.  Galschiot’s works illustrate these themes unambiguously. Freedom to Pollute, a kitsch, six metre-high figurine, depicts the Stature of Liberty with a smoking torch symbolic of western consumption. The fibreglass piece is surrounded by Climate Refugees, a series of bronze sculptures of people forced to flee by the impact of global warming. But how do you make global warming more personal? The climate ribbon initiative, found across Paris from the People’s Climate summit to the Place de la République – not to mention in the public area of the climate conference itself – poses a simple question: what do you love and hope never to lose to climate chaos? Beguilingly simple yet strangely effective, the initiative offers a secular echo of lighting a candle in church, with people invited to write their answer to the question on a coloured ribbon and tie it to a crafted tree. The artists ask participants to read the replies of others and carry their wishes with them. Similarly colourful is an experimental pop-up shelter that peaks out beneath Parisian rooftops at the festival of alternatives in Montreuil. The accordion-like structure is part of an exhibition and workshop on ecological building. But while commissioned works of art vie with labours of patient devotion, there is also a place for the quick work of a furtive spray can and stencil. Some of these messages get straight to the point."
"The US has promised to double to $861m aid to countries on the frontline of climate change in the final push to reach an agreement to avoid dangerous global warming at crucial UN talks in Paris. As the negotiations moved into their critical final phase, the White House said the US would deepen its commitment to help low-lying and poor countries that are already threatened by rising seas and powerful storms.  The additional aid, announced by John Kerry, the secretary of state, came as part of an all-out offensive by the White House and administration officials to seal a deal at Paris. “We need to get the job done,’’ Kerry said in a hard-hitting speech to the Paris meeting. “This moment demands we do not leave Paris without a durable ambitious climate agreement.” As Barack Obama worked the phones from Washington, calling the leaders of India and Brazil, Kerry praised countries moving towards renewable energy, and proffered more aid to countries already living with the impacts of climate change on the ground. “There are countries we know for which climate change is an existential threat today,” Kerry said. “We have a moral responsibility today to adapt and prepare for those impacts.” He said the US would double the existing $430m budget for adaptation by 2020, and that the funds would come in addition to $3bn the US pledged earlier to the Green Climate Fund, which will focus more on helping countries move to green energy and cut emissions. Administration officials said the funds would go towards building up weather forecasts and early warning systems to help countries exposed to extreme storms. It was not immediately clear how the additional funds would be delivered – or how Obama would get around inevitable opposition to the expenditure from Republicans in Congress. They have tried to block the US from entering an agreement at Paris, or providing climate aid to developing countries. Administration officials said they would not “cannibalise” existing aid budgets, and suggested that Congress would see the sense of spending money to prevent disaster – rather than clearing up after catastrophes. The aid was an attempt to win over developing countries who say the US, Europe and other rich countries have failed to deliver on promised funds to fight climate change. The World Resources Institute, a respected environmental thinktank, said adding to the pot for climate finance could help reach a deal. “These funds will increase the total pot of climate finance available to support vulnerable countries and shows the US commitment to reach a strong outcome,” it said. On Tuesday, resentments from developing countries became even more public when Brazil, India, and South Africa said they had no confidence in assertions from the OECD that rich countries were two-thirds of the way to meeting a goal to mobilise $100bn in climate aid, saying the accounting was murky and unclear. Those tussles over finance will be increasingly critical as countries pore over the draft text scheduled for release by the French hosts later on Wednesday. “The next 48 hours will be all hard and real negotiations,” Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister, told a press conference. But he added: “We will ensure that the world has a good outcome from Paris.”"

"Ministers are back in Paris for the final stretch of COP 21 negotiations. A draft is in hand, peppered with the brackets that indicate areas of disagreement. France’s foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, is busy constructing coalitions. The process of paring down the brackets has begun in earnest.  It is not clear what the agreement will be, but it is clear that there will be an agreement. That means Paris can be declared a success. Of course, Paris was condemned to succeed. The ignominy that was Copenhagen (COP15, 2009) was never to be its destiny. That meant getting to an agreement – any agreement. Now that such an agreement is in sight, there is a palpable sigh of relief. Now is a good time to ask just how meaningful (or not) any given Paris agreement will be. Here are 10 questions I will be using as a yardstick. They will be my guide to exactly what we are celebrating, and how much we should celebrate. Given the science, the experience of a quarter century of climate talks, and all the promises made in the past three years, an ideal agreement should garner 10 “yes” responses. I, however, will be happy with anything that gets at least five. Anything less, I think, will not be worth the carbon cost of everything that has gone into the process. 1. Is there an agreement? Any agreement? 2. Are there binding emission targets for industrialised countries?  The responsibility of industrialised countries is already enshrined in Annex I of the Kyoto protocol. Here, and elsewhere, “binding” would imply clear legal language that makes implementation a responsibility that states would, and could, be held accountable for. 3. Are there binding emission targets for major emerging economies with large emissions? This category could be defined, for example, by G20 membership. However, it would, at a minimum, include the two mega-emitters, China and India. 4. Does the agreement include quantifiable financial commitments to assist developing countries in mitigation and adaptation, and are these a) binding, b) sufficient, and c) additional? The obligation to assist developing countries in mitigation and adaptation to climate change has long been accepted. However, actual commitments tend to be vague and often remain unfunded. A yes on this question would mean all of the following: a) any commitment made is considered binding and implemented transparently, b) the already agreed goal of $100bn by 2020 is met or exceeded, and c) any climate financing is “additional” and does not simply relocate existing development assistance allocations. 5. Does it include a clear roadmap for restricting global warming to 2C or less? The 2C goal is already contained in international agreements. This question, therefore, pertains to whether the Paris agreement will include a clear pathway to reaching this goal through intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) or other mechanisms. 6. Does it revise the long-term goal to restrict global warming to 1.5C or less? The most vulnerable countries, and many scientists, have argued for a downward revision in the long-term goal of climate stabilisation on the grounds that several hundreds of millions of people will slip through the crack between a 2C and a 1.5C goal. 7. Is 2020 confirmed as the date for the next major round of commitments and review of progress? Any slippage will result in delays in action and could have adverse long-term impacts for vulnerable countries and communities. 8. Is there a clear and independent mechanism to measure, report and verify emission reduction claims? Especially in the possible absence of binding commitments, a robust and independent system for reporting emission reductions (mitigation) is necessary. Any self-reporting mechanism would, by default, result in a “no” answer to this question. 9. Does the agreement include clear language on conditions for adaptation financing for vulnerable developing countries? The goal of developing “adaptative capacity” in vulnerable developing countries must not be an unfunded mandate. Clear language on the responsibility of industrialised and large emerging economies to fund such activity, and the principles for its use and disbursement, must not be left vague and should be included in any agreement. 10. Is there a clear mechanism for dealing with “loss and damage”? There are a number of climate change impacts, particularly in the most vulnerable and poorest countries, that will be difficult or impossible to adapt to. We need a clear mechanism – including principles for funding and disbursement of support – to respond to them."

"A package of measures to improve innovation in the economy, unveiled by Malcolm Turnbull, has had an airing on the world stage with foreign minister Julie Bishop citing it at the Paris climate talks as evidence of Australia’s belief that “technological breakthroughs” will solve the climate change problem. “Today in Australia the prime minister launched a new national innovation and science agenda to place innovation at the heart of our economy,” Bishop told ministers from around the world in her short, allocated introductory statement at the start of a week of high-level negotiations in Paris.  “Australia will lead by example in the way we invest in and reward technology … it will be innovation and technological breakthroughs that will ultimately bring the breakthroughs in our climate change responses,” she said. Bishop arrived in Paris on Sunday to lead Australia’s negotiating team in the crucial final week, scheduled to finish late Friday. Her statement contained no new promises and repeated Australia’s prediction that it will “meet and beat” its minimum emissions target for 2020. Australia is doing this with the help of the international accounting rules which allow the “carryover” of emission reductions from earlier commitment periods. Leading European countries last week promised not to use “carry-over” but Australia has said it will not follow suit. She described Australia’s 2030 target, to cut emissions by between 26 and 28% compared with 2005 levels as “ambitious”. Climate tracker - an international non government group that assesses national targets - describes Australia’s as “inadequate”. Bishop said Australia is “transforming the way we generate electricity” via its renewable energy target, which was wound back by the Abbott government earlier this year. And she repeated Australia’s promise to spend at least $200mn a year from its existing aid budget on climate activities, including $635,000 to help women take part in “climate related decision-making processes.” On her first full day in Paris Bishop was meetingthe Japanese environment minister Tamayo Marukawa. Australia has joined 32 other countries in trenchant opposition to Japan’s decision to renew whaling in the southern ocean this summer and has said it is “exploring options for further legal action”. The high-level negotiations were opened by the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius and the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon who implored the gathered ministers to reach an ambitious agreement and reminded them what was at stake. Ban pointed to a “rising tide” of demands for a strong agreement from business, city administrations, Pope Francis and world faith leaders and the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who marched last Sunday. The assembled ministers “have a moral and political duty to heed those voices”, Ban said. “The world is expecting more from you than half measures and incremental approaches, it is calling for a transformative agreement … the eyes of the world are upon you,” he said. “Seven billion people want to know that you, the world’s leaders, have their interests at heart and those of their children.” Fabius said the 150 world leaders who came to Paris last Monday had given the meeting a clear mandate. “You must succeed … it is up to you to take those decisions, you are political decision makers, in other words you are entrusted with the task of finding answers.”  Ban set out the elements of a strong Paris agreement, most of them still hotly disputed in the draft text before negotiators. He said the agreement must contain a goal to limit temperature rise to less than 2 degrees, because for many states even 1.5 degrees of warming would have “grave consequences”; and include regular reviews, starting before 2020, so that countries could strengthen their national commitments “according to what the science tells us”. It also had to include a single framework for measuring, monitoring and reporting how countries are meeting their emission reduction promises, and clear commitments from developed countries on financing poor countries’ efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to already locked-in warming. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said she was kept up at night by the vision of the next seven generations, asking her what she had done to solve the problem of climate change. “The same question will be asked of each of you. May we all be able to stand tall and clearly say, we did everything that was necessary,” she told the ministers. But the statements from leading negotiators raised all the same divisions that have dogged the talks for years. Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, the South African diplomat who chairs Group of 77 and China negotiating bloc (which now covers 134 countries) said the 77 had not come to Paris to “renegotiate, rewrite or reinterpret” the original 1992 climate convention, which embeds the idea of “differentiation” of the contributions of developed and developing countries. Countries like the United States and Australia say the categorisation of countries has changed dramatically over the past 23 years and the Paris agreement must include the expectation that all nations work towards the same rules for monitoring and reviewing their emissions reductions."
"Rule one of diplomacy is, walk your talk: otherwise people stop listening. In Paris last week David Cameron called for “action today”, not excuses tomorrow, on climate change. Back home, his ministers are already making excuses for what looks increasingly like a systematic repudiation of 10 years of successful action to build a prosperous low-carbon economy in Britain. The Green MP Caroline Lucas is right to have called this a “spectacular display of cognitive dissonance”. Not surprisingly, the world is beginning to notice. “On eve of Paris climate summit, Britain pulls plug on renewables”, read a recent headline in the Washington Post. The job of government on climate change is to ensure attractive and stable conditions for investment in the low-carbon transition. In recent months our government has hit the brakes on onshore wind and solar energy, on energy efficiency and on community renewable schemes. Its plan to sell off the Green Investment Bank will destroy a crucial financing mechanism. Its trashing of a 10-year effort to make the UK a leader in carbon capture and storage blew away more than £100m in imminent investment from China. Its surreptitious edging away from its 2020 renewables target casts doubt on all its climate promises. Meanwhile our energy secretary, Amber Rudd, has invited a new dash for gas. If implemented at the scale apparently intended, this will kill the Climate Change Act by steadily undermining our capacity to stick to its legally binding carbon pathway. The government’s unnecessary and undeliverable obsessions with disruptive fracking and expensive nuclear energy will further chill investment in renewables and energy efficiency. And as camouflage for her boss in Paris, Rudd has claimed credit for a phase-out of coal that her predecessors had already made inevitable. Our government claims to want coherent policies. So why did it slap a carbon tax, the climate change levy, on carbon-neutral renewable energy? Our government claims to want value for money. So why is it signing up for a nuclear power plant that will make our electricity needlessly expensive for 20 years while putting obstacles in the path of onshore wind, the cheapest form of carbon-neutral energy? Our government claims to want local people to decide on local infrastructure. So why is it desperate to force fracking on unwilling communities while obstructing the renewables schemes they desire? Recent dismay from the Scottish government is a warning that these policies may sow new divisions between London and Edinburgh. Scotland needs more, not less, ambition nationally to realise the potential of its abundant renewable energy resources and escape from its unhealthy dependence on North Sea oil and gas. Privatisation of the Green Investment Bank will weaken the attraction of Edinburgh, where it is based, as a centre for low-carbon finance. When our leaders speak, we should not only listen to what they say but read their lips. Reading the lips of Rudd and the chancellor, George Osborne, it is hard to escape the conclusion that these incoherent, unconvincing policies seem driven more by ideology and casual expediency than by a serious assessment of what Britain needs. Any incoming government is entitled to make changes. There were gaps and contradictions in the energy and climate policies this government inherited. But in its response there is little sign of real intent to make sure that our country does at home what our prime minister has just urged on the rest of the world. Every step it has taken has been a step backwards. Conditions for investment are now less attractive and less stable. That imposes extra risks on investors – risks consumers will be asked to pay for. That is, of course, on top of the growing risks to our people arising from climate change itself. The floods that have brought death and suffering to Lancashire and Cumbria are just the latest reminder of those. As for diplomacy, the world’s governments will probably agree this week on a new basis for global action on climate. It will be a step forward. But it will only take us, at best, to the end of the beginning. Whether we can achieve the sustained effort that this challenge really demands will depend less on deals about to be done in Paris and more on choices made globally over the next five years as governments strive to turn their promises into action and push up levels of ambition that are still inadequate. The UK’s backward lurch has, thankfully, come too late to damage prospects at Paris. But it is nonsense to claim, as our ministers have, that the choices they are making will not cut our diplomacy off at the knees. And it is rich for them to accuse other parties of weaponising climate policy when it is they who have broken the cross-party consensus that gave our diplomacy a special edge. No country has done more than Britain to spur global progress on climate. We have done that by walking our talk, with strong diplomacy based on a strong domestic base. It would be a tragedy and a betrayal of our national interest if, just as our competitors pick up the pace, we start giving succour to those nations and industries that want to slow down an endeavour on whose success all our destinies depend."

" Democratic senators staged a show of force at the Paris climate meeting on Saturday, pledging they “had Barack Obama’s back” and would defend his agenda in a Republican-controlled Congress. The appearance by 10 Democratic senators, days after Congress voted to repeal new power plant rules, was intended to demonstrate solid political support for Obama’s climate plan – despite Republican claims to the contrary.  The 10 senators, the first wave of an expected US political invasion of the climate talks, said they would be prepared to defend Obama’s agenda in Congress and push for stronger climate action. “What you see here are people who are going to protect what the president is putting on the table here in Paris as a promise from the American people to the world,” Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, told a press conference. “We are going to back up the president every step of the way.” Republican presidential contenders and the party’s leadership in Congress have moved repeatedly to undercut Obama’s position as a global leader on climate change. Last week, the House of Representatives voted to repeal the clean power plant rules that are the main pillar of Obama’s climate plan and released statements accusing the president of pursuing “a suspect climate agenda”. The White House has said it would veto any such measures, and Republicans do not have the votes to overturn a presidential veto. The senators said they were in Paris to demonstrate there was strong political commitment to fighting climate change. “We are moving in the right direction and we are not going to back down,” said Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico. “We have the president’s back and we are going to make sure we keep moving in the right direction.” But Markey said there would be more fights to come, warning that Republicans were mobilising to overturn increased fuel efficiency rules, which would raise the standard for US cars to an average of 54mpg. Obama’s focus on climate change has put the Paris meeting on the US political map to a much greater extent than in past years. The Democratic delegation included some of the strongest climate warriors in Congress such as Markey, who co-wrote the 2009 climate bill, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who has delivered well over 100 speeches about climate change on the Senate floor, and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who last month co-wrote a bill with presidential contender Bernie Sanders that would halt new fossil fuel extraction on public lands. All of the senators have come out strongly in favour of the US playing a global role on climate change, and called for a strong deal in Paris. Ben Cardin of Maryland, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Coons of Delaware, Al Franken of Minnesota, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Tom Udall of New Mexico also made the trip. Several Obama administration officials are scheduled to visit Paris to demonstrate US commitment to fighting climate change.  A far bigger delegation – with Republicans as well as Democrats – is expected to visit the meeting next week, and could deliver a much more ambivalent message from the US about a climate deal."
"The devastating floods in parts of northern England have resulted in a massive collaborative effort to save the lives and property of those affected (‘We never thought that this could happen again’, 7 December). But amid the understandable concern for these human victims, we must also remember the hundreds – possibly thousands – of animals that will perish, largely unremarked upon. As in the spring of 2013, when heavy snow and freezing weather led to the traumatic deaths of more than 100,000 animals – mostly sheep – the latest flood victims have received virtually no mention in any of the national media. And even in the online farming press, there are just sketchy accounts that are devoid of any mention of welfare impacts. They amount to a brief audit of losses.  The public should give up the idea that it is “natural” to leave sheep out in fields and on hills, even in brutal winter and summer weather. The reality is that their lives are harsh, their suffering is considerable and, unless they die beforehand, their last terrifying moments are in a slaughterhouse. Being upset by their plight is the compassionate response, but to make a difference, please consider adopting a humane, vegan diet.Andrew TylerDirector, Animal Aid • “After [David Cameron] took office in 2010, annual funding for flood defences was slashed by 27%”, with Labour’s surge in funding in response to the 2007 floods “halted by the coalition in 2010”. (Analysis, 8 December). Many examples of Tory cuts or undelivered flood defences are cited in this article. And the devastation wrought by Storm Desmond has been matched by the relentless slashing of budgets across the board, almost entirely in the name of Osborne’s austerity craze. As ever, those who can pay are blind to this wanton excess of destruction, so “Cameron has visited Cumbria” but, beyond a photo opportunity, will offer his usual sticking plaster to contain the floods. And ministers from all departments will continue their hi-vis tours of enfeebled and depleted police forces, jobcentres, schools, care homes and hospitals where corridors serve as wards. Ignoring the irony, they do like a busy foodbank where they can praise the volunteer spirit of their citizens and rest easy in the knowledge that everyone’s doing their bit.Carolyn KirtonAberdeen • It’s not just that, in the words of your editorial’s headline, “Flood defences are a higher priority than another runway” (8 December): it’s that the latter would increase the need for the former.Jem WhiteleyOxford • Your editorial, George Monbiot’s article (Do little, hide the evidence: the official neglect that caused these deadly floods, 8 December) and your reports on the Cumbrian emergency – and the recent history of flooding elsewhere – must now show everyone that climate change poses at least as great a threat to the security of the UK as any recent sporadic terrorism. In the face of this threat, where is the sense of urgency; the immediate parliamentary debate, the action plan and mobilisation of effective resources both national, local and international required to defeat such a fundamental attack on the safety, livelihood and wellbeing of every potentially threatened community throughout these islands?Michael PoulterStafford • How I do agree with George Monbiot and the letter from Peter Shaw about beavers (8 December). Here on the southern edge of the North York Moors national park we don’t have beavers, but we do have the Slowing the Flow project, which was visited by Elisabeth Truss recently. Although she praised the innovative ideas of the statutory bodies as well as the national park, she has only spoken of more and more flood defences in towns over the last few days. As part of the work was done by volunteers, I would have thought that this was an ideal opportunity for a Tory minister to put her money where her mouth was some months ago.Janice GwilliamNorton, North Yorkshire • There must surely be someone in government or the Environment Agency who has common sense enough to cure the flooding problem. Unless flood barriers are placed along rivers from near the source to the sea, the problem is merely moved downstream. The only logical solution is to create new flood plains, to replace those that have been stupidly built on over the centuries. These should be new reservoirs, with concrete run offs to them, constructed on the outer bends of rivers, placed upstream from all towns etc prone to flooding. As soon as rivers reach a certain height, they would start to fill. The potential uses for such reservoirs, from leisure activities to fish farming, to watercress beds are endless, not to mention the increasingly valuable extra water supply, which will be saved and could be exported to regions affected by drought.Edward LyonSandown, Isle of Wight • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"A leading scientist who features in David Attenborough’s new series about the Great Barrier Reef has told the Australian government it cannot expand coal exports and continue to claim to be protecting the reef. The government is planning a big tourism campaign to run at the same time as the new series screens around the world.  Biologist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg made the remarks to Guardian Australia as Tourism Australia “clarified” the purpose of its $1.5m in funding for the BBC project. It retracted public statements that the money was a no-strings contribution to the production of the three-part series and said it had now been informed the funds were used for a subsequent educational campaign. Hoegh-Guldberg compered a panel discussion with Sir David, Sir Richard Branson, explorer and marine biologist Sylvia Earle and the director general of WWF-International Marco Lambertini at La Maison des Oceans in Paris on Saturday ahead of a special screening of the first episode of the series.  Australia’s environment minister Greg Hunt firmly requested – some said demanded – a chance to speak after the screening because of Australia’s financial contribution to the series, sources told Guardian Australia.  Hoegh-Guldberg, a professor and director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, cut off a question to the panel about the incompatibility of approving Adani’s $16bn proposed coalmine in Queensland and protecting the reef, saying the minister would answer it in his remarks after the screening. Hunt did not address the question, but in answer to a similar question earlier at the Paris conference claimed rejecting the mine would have amounted to “neo-colonialism” by Australia. He did mention Australia’s $140m “reef trust” to combat soil erosion, crown of thorns starfish and other threats. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Hoegh-Guldberg said in his opinion opening the coalmine was incompatible with limiting global warming to 2C, or 1.5C in the longer term, goals considered necessary for the future of the reef.  “There’s a disjunct between the agreement that we have to keep global warming below 2 degrees, and 1.5 degrees in the longer term, necessary for the healthy future of the reef, and opening the world’s largest coalmine. Anyone would see that as strange and the government needs to face the fact that expanding our coal and gas exports is not consistent with the imperative of keeping 80% of fossil fuel reserves in the ground. We need to resolve that as a government and as a nation,” he said. “We can’t have it both ways.” A spokesman for Tourism Australia told Guardian Australia on Tuesday it had invested $1.5m to assist in the production of the series because it complemented a new campaign featuring Australia’s “aquatic and coastal experiences”. He said Tourism Australia had no involvement in the editorial decision-making or script, but had taken “the opportunity to invest in a series with global reach that will shine a light on the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most popular attractions in Australia”. “The timing could not be better for us because our new tourism campaign is all about aquatic and coastal experiences,” he said. But Atlantic Productions, the company that made the series, said Tourism Australia was wrong. “No Australian government funding went into the production of the BBC television series. Separately, Tourism Australia is assisting in the production of an educational IMAX 3D film about the Great Barrier Reef to be launched in 2017, with various outreach and educational projects which will also be launched later,” a spokeswoman said.  “Neither Tourism Australia nor the Australian government had any input in or editorial control over the series” which had been “made under the normal strict editorial guidelines governing a BBC project,” she said. Tourism Australia’s executive general manager of corporate affairs, Karen Halbert, then contacted Guardian Australia to say Atlantic Productions had “asked that we clarify our position with Atlantic on this project”. “Tourism Australia funded part of a multi-platform media project (which includes an IMAX 3D film as well as various outreach and educational projects) between Atlantic Productions and Tourism Australia aimed at inspiring greater interest in the world’s largest coral reef system. We have been informed by Atlantic Productions that our investment has not been allocated into the production of the BBC television series,” she said. At the Paris screening, Hoegh-Guldberg asked Sir David what would happen if world leaders did not agree to limit warming to 1.5C because of the cost. “The expense of not doing it is gigantic,” the filmmaker said. “Seventy per cent of all fish species are dependent on the coral reef at some stage in their lives. If we were to lose coral reefs, the biological and ecological destruction of life in the ocean would be enormous and for those people who live on the coast and depend on fish for their food it would be a major loss.” Queensland’s environment minister, Steven Miles, has also said that “the greatest long-term threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change. If we are serious about protecting the Great Barrier Reef, we need the Australian government to stand up and do our bit to reduce carbon pollution and limit global warming.” The Australian government has backed the 1.5C goal in the new climate agreement, but its national greenhouse gas reduction target has been branded as “inadequate”. Climate change is addressed in the third episode of the BBC series, dealing with threats to the reef. Australia House in London recently hosted celebrities including the Duke of Edinburgh and chef Heston Blumenthal to a special screening of the episode. Conservation groups have asked the federal court to overturn Hunt’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael mine because he did not take into account the impact on the reef of the greenhouse gases emitted when the coal is burned. A recent report  found the coal from the mine would create annual emissions similar to those from countries such as Malaysia and Austria, and more than New York City."
"Si rien n’est fait, avertissent les climatologues, les températures pourraient augmenter de presque 5°C d’ici 2100 par rapport au niveau de l’époque préindustrielle. Les dirigeants mondiaux qui se retrouvent à Paris, espèrent limiter la hausse de la température moyenne sur Terre à 2°C maximum – mais les analyses montrent que leurs engagements à réduire les émissions ne permettraient que d’en arriver à 3°C. Alors qu’il est très difficile de faire des prévisions fermes, voici une liste des impacts potentiels.

"Contrary to the article by James Hansen, Kerry Emanuel, Ken Caldeira and Tom Wigley (Nuclear power paves the only viable path forward on climate change, 3 December), many scientists around the world remain sceptical that nuclear is the answer, or even part of the answer, to climate change. The academic authors have a fine record in identifying the causes and consequences of climate change, but their proposed solution simply doesn’t make sense. The main problem is that, contrary what many think, nuclear power is a poor method of reducing carbon emissions: its uranium ore and fuel processes have heavy carbon footprints. Indeed, of the ways to reduce carbon emissions in the energy sphere, nuclear is by far the most expensive in terms of pound per tonne of carbon saved.  Renewables, especially wind and solar, are now less expensive, quicker to install, and much safer: with them one does not have to worry about the spectres of Chernobyl and Fukushima. But perhaps most important of all is the moral dimension. Given the technical and political obstacles to dangerous spent nuclear fuel, should we be passing these problems to future generations? What about the Irish Sea, still the most radioactively contaminated sea in the world due to Sellafield’s discharges? What about the sheep farms in north Wales still subject to food controls due to radioactive contamination from Chernobyl almost 30 years ago? The climate change negotiators in Paris should think hard before recommending nuclear as a solution. It isn’t.Dr Paul Dorfman Dr Ian Fairlie Dr David Lowry Jonathon Porritt  • In his speech to COP in Paris, Prince Charles said “We must save our forests” and “There is no plan B to tackle climate change without them.” I agree our forests are vital; but there is a plan B that would save them – and mitigate climate change. It would also greatly reduce hunger, malnutrition and poverty. To save tropical forests we first have to reduce the pressures from tropical agriculture. This involves simple and inexpensive biological approaches to rehabilitate degraded farm land and improve crop yields from the current 10-15% of their biological potential. Then we need to plant local, highly favoured, traditionally important food trees to reduce hunger and malnutrition – species like safou, marula, shea, eru, baobab, and hundreds of others producing tasty, nutritious and marketable fruits, nuts and edible leaves. This diversification also restores ecological health and, importantly, generates income from the sale of their products in local markets. The final step is to set up new cottage industries to process and add value to these products, creating business and job opportunities to further improve household livelihoods. Of course, this is the antithesis of conventional modern agriculture and is not understood by policymakers, but where it has been done it has been a huge success – see “Living with the Trees of Life – Towards the Transformation of Tropical Agriculture” (CABI, 2012). If you don’t believe me, ask the poor farmers of Africa. They fully understand it, and make the importance of this abundantly clear when they apply to us at the International Tree Foundation for funding. Prof Roger LeakeyInternational Tree Foundation • News about the airstrikes in Syria is in danger of overshadowing developments at the climate conference in Paris. Some environmentalists may view this as regrettable, but the upside is that it should serve to highlight that the two are actually linked. Between 2006 and 2009 Syria experienced its worst recorded drought. It left up to 1.5 million people refugees in their own country. This placed severe demands on urban centres to employ, house and feed rising populations that were largely ignored by the Assad government. Protests and the subsequent uprising in 2011 led to the current civil war and the rise of Daesh. A study by Kelley et al published this year in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1421533112) makes a convincing case for the initial drought to be associated with human-modified climate change. Increasing conflict, mass migration and geopolitical instability are the real impacts of unmitigated climate change.Prof John DearingUniversity of Southampton • I sat in my house in Kendal on Saturday night watching the floodwaters creep up the road to a level never seen before. I was terrified, as were friends and townspeople. My neighbours had to evacuate, their homes waist-deep in water. The floodwaters stopped one house away from mine. Storms hitting north-west England, particularly Cumbria, are becoming more common. They cause terror and disruption to us and our infrastructure on a scale that terrorists could never hope to achieve. Why is the government not waging war on climate change? The implication of climate-induced disruption and terror for people in their everyday lives is huge. Surely we should be dealing with this threat as a priority and making our infrastructure more resilient to such weather extremes. Cumbria county council is facing another round of enormous cuts. How are we supposed to get back on our feet after these catastrophic floods when there is no money to fix the roads and railways, to fix flooded schools and day centres, and pay staff to do so? There is of course money to bomb Syria, despite the fact that severe climate change-induced weather events are significantly more of a threat to our way of life than Daesh.Dr Kate WillshawKendal, Cumbria • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has said governments trying to reach a climate agreement in Paris face a tough fight in the 72 hours remaining to reach a deal. The talks move into the endgame on Wednesday, when the French hosts produce a new draft text for review by the 195 assembled countries.  French officials have said the talks will end with a strong outcome and on time on Friday – although climate negotiations typically run over into the early hours of Saturday and even Sunday. But Kerry said governments face a tough slog to reach a deal. “I think consensus is slowly being built. There will be differences tomorrow. Some of them will be sharp, and that is where your final stage fight will be beginning, but I think there is a growing feeling of possibility,” Kerry told a small group of reporters. The challenge of reaching an agreement has now been handed off from negotiators to ministers and cabinet officials like Kerry. When the talks got underway at the start of the week, the 48-page draft text was littered with more than 900 sets of brackets indicating areas of disagreement – which is considered a relatively positive position for a climate negotiation. After mainly upbeat statements from US and European officials, Kerry offered a fairly sober view of the prospects for an agreement in Paris that would ensure that future warming remains below dangerous levels. Kerry indicated some areas of emerging agreement. After meetings with leaders of Tuvalu and other small islands most vulnerable to climate change, he said that the US was inclined to support their demands to set a goal of limiting warming to 1.5C. However, he described the target as an add-on to the agreement, and more of an aspiration than a must-do.  “I think you can write that aspiration into the agreement in a way that doesn’t make it the target or guidepost for the agreement,” Kerry said. Even after lengthy negotiations, conducted by smaller working groups huddled behind closed doors, a number of stumbling blocks to an agreement remain – the main one being the division of responsibility between rich and poor countries for cutting emissions. But Kerry rejected a key argument from developing countries that the current structure of the deal – that was widely influenced by the US – did not adequately reflect those different economic histories. “The entire agreement is based on differentiation,” he said. Other obstacles to a strong deal remain, Kerry said. He accused unnamed countries of getting in the way of a deal. “I think there are a few countries that wouldn’t mind coming out of here with a minimalist consequence and result and I think the verdict is very much out on what is manageable there,” Kerry said. “We just have to see where the text emerges before we really know how the lines are drawn.” As the talks move towards the finish, China, Brazil and South Africa joined India in rejecting a key OECD study saying that rich countries have already mobilised two-thirds of the $100bn (£67bn) pledged to secure a new climate deal. Their stand suggests that finance will continue to be a big sticking point in the negotiations."
"Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, is to head a new global taskforce aimed at highlighting the financial exposure of companies to the risk of climate change. Investors, insurers, banks and consumers will be provided with more information under plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system, at the COP21 Paris climate change conference on Friday.  Announcing the decision, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and FSB chair, said the industry-led body would help the financial markets understand mounting climate-change risks. Carney, who proposed the creation of the climate change taskforce in a speech to the Lloyd’s insurance market in September, added: “Access to high-quality financial information will allow market participants and policymakers to understand and better manage those risks, which are likely to grow with time.” Carney said that Bloomberg, the UN special envoy for cities and climate change, had “an unparalleled track record of execution in a broad range of fields and his lifelong commitment to open and transparent financial markets make him the ideal leader for the taskforce”. Bloomberg, the billionaire founder of the eponymous financial news and data company, said: “It’s critical that industries and investors understand the risks posed by climate change, but currently there is too little transparency about those risks.  “While the business and finance communities are already playing a leading role on climate change, through investments in technological innovation and clean energy, this taskforce will accelerate that activity by increasing transparency. And in doing so, it will help make markets more efficient, and economies more stable and resilient.” The FSB said the taskforce would complete its work within a year and would deliver specific recommendations for voluntary disclosure principles. As part of its work the taskforce will conduct public outreach. Chris Cheetham, global chief investment officer at HSBC global asset management, said: “The establishment of this taskforce is an important step towards creating the transparency and consistent standards needed for investors and pension funds to understand the risks and opportunities within their portfolios as we transition to a low carbon economy.” Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of IIGCC, a European network of Institutional Investors with €13tn (£8.61tn) in assets, said: “Access to high-quality information can only help accelerate the reallocation of capital by investors in ways that will accelerate the low carbon transition. More consistent and reliable carbon disclosure will make it easier for investors to evaluate climate risk in their portfolios and understand where the opportunities in clean energy and other essential low carbon technology lie.”  In April 2015, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors asked the FSB “to convene public- and private- sector participants to review how the financial sector can take account of climate-related issues”. The idea was pursued by Carney in his Lloyds speech. The Bank of England governor said in September that it was important to take action because “once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late”. He added: “Companies would disclose not only what they are emitting today, but how they plan their transition to the net-zero world of the future. The G20 – whose member states account for around 85% of global emissions has a unique ability to make this possible.” Simon Howard, chief executive of the UK sustainable and investment finance association said better disclosure would help investors prepare for the challenges ahead and play a part in identifying profitable mitigation opportunities.

"Australia has signed a Paris declaration calling for new clear rules for international carbon trading in a signal the Coalition’s six-year carbon pricing policy veto could be softening as it prepares to review its climate policy in 2017. Foreign minister Julie Bishop, who signed the declaration in Paris, said it was in Australia’s interests to recognise the role an international carbon market might play in reducing emissions after 2020.  “It’s just a declaration, it’s not legally binding,” she said after a speech to an event organised by Australia’s Carbon Market Institute. “It’s signalling our commitment to working with others about rules for a carbon market post 2020. The detail is for each country to include in their domestic policies, and this is something Australia will consider in due course. “It is a declaration that recognises the role a carbon market might play after 2020 and we thought it would be in our national interest to sign up to it,” she said. “We are engaging closely with business as we work towards developing and reviewing our domestic climate policies in 2017 and we deeply appreciate the private sector’s interest in accessing international [carbon] units and recognise international carbon markets are also a key part of the global effort to reduce emissions. Carbon markets can provide flexibility for countries and companies to use genuine and verified international units to help meet their commitments.” The declaration, pushed by New Zealand and set to be announced at the end of the Paris meeting, calls for countries to work on transparent rules for carbon trading after 2020 so that they have the choice to enter into bilateral or multilateral carbon trading arrangements. The Coalition has said it will review its Direct Action climate policy in 2017, including the so-called safeguards mechanism – which could at that time become a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme – and also whether businesses will be able to buy offshore carbon permits. The quality of international carbon markets has been of concern to the Coalition in the past. Tony Abbott once described buying international permits as being like sending “money … offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”.  Australia’s opposition to allowing businesses to buy offshore permits began to soften towards the end of Abbott’s prime ministership, and is now considered almost inevitable after 2017.  Bishop said the declaration was not about domestic climate policy, but companies only need offshore credits if they have a domestic liability. At the moment the “baselines” or benchmarks set for emissions from the 140 businesses covered by the safeguards mechanism are set to stop wild increases in emissions, with no business ever likely to exceed them. But the 2017 review will consider whether they should be tightened to make sure policies can achieve the 2030 emissions reduction target Australia has pledged in Paris; to allow businesses who exceed their baselines to buy emission reduction credits from those who have managed to do better; and whether they should be able to source permits offshore. The review could also consider other versions of carbon pricing. Environment minister Greg Hunt has said the “safeguards mechanism” is slated to deliver 200m tonnes of greenhouse gas abatement by 2030 – something that would require major change.  There has been an overwhelming consensus from business groups in Paris that a carbon price would be the most efficient mechanism to drive deep emission reductions. On the first day of the talks the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and six heads of state launched the carbon pricing leadership coalition, which called on all countries to start pricing carbon pollution. The coalition includes more than 90 businesses and non government organisations. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said “the right carbon price” had to be at the centre of reducing emissions and “given the slump in energy prices, there has never been a better time to transition to smart, credible and effective carbon pricing”. “Policy makers need to price it right, tax it smart and do it now,” she said, The call was backed by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto, French president François Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Chilean president Michelle Bachelet Jeria, and Ethiopian prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn. World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim said it was important to get “momentum” behind carbon pricing. Labor’s environment minister Mark Butler told the same Carbon Markets Institute event Labor remained convinced that a cap and trade scheme was the most effective policy, but indicated Labor might reconsider – in the interests of business certainty – if the Coalition won the next election and established its safeguards mechanism as a working baseline and credit scheme.  He said businesses told him a baseline and credit scheme was a “clunkier model” and that they would prefer cap and trade, but he said “if years down the track it has become a serious proposition and has deep roots and everyone has constructed their operations around it, then come back to me”. Lewis Tyndall, co-founder of GreenCollar – a firm that has been a big winner from the government’s Direct Action auctions, told the same event: “Greg Hunt has described the safeguards mechanism as a baseline and credit system ... everybody is saying we should have a carbon markets of some kind, from a tax to baseline and credit system to an emissions trading scheme, and we agree.” Greens leader Richard Di Natale said he was disappointed at the lack of ambition in the Australian government’s position in Paris. “We continue to be one of the few countries who advocate the use of fossil fuels as a solution to poverty,” he said. New Zealand is particularly keen for clear international carbon trading rules as its domestic emissions are largely from agriculture and it has limited options to reduce them."

"As the Paris talks enter their final week, there is increased focus on the impact of climate change in the world’s poorest nations. Representing least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states, Gyan Chandra Acharya calls on leaders to make the most vulnerable countries the top priority. “It is a sad reality that while the world’s most vulnerable countries have contributed the least to climate change, they are most at risk from its negative effects and the least equipped to withstand and adapt to it,” Acharya writes. You can stay updated with the Guardian’s coverage of the latest news from COP 21, including Africa’s ambitious renewable energy drive backed by the continent’s leaders, the latest push from religious leaders on action against climate change, and China’s call for rich countries to take responsibility for historical greenhouse gas emissions. What should the world do in the face of unprecedented humanitarian disaster? As complex conflicts continue to unfold, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, says the priority should be strengthening respect for the laws of war. “Not enough countries, not enough armies, not enough armed groups, are abiding by the fundamental human values enshrined in the Geneva conventions,” Maurer writes.

"Developing countries should not be treated as a single bloc at the climate change talks in Paris, as their interests are often starkly divergent, the former president of Mexico has said. Felipe Calderón was Mexico’s leader at the Cancún climate talks in 2010, which enshrined under the UN process commitments made a year earlier at the chaotic summit in Copenhagen. He is now the chairman of a global commission on the New Climate Economy.   In an interview with the Guardian, he warned that the differences among developing countries can be as great as those between them and the rich world. “Sub-Saharan Africa is not the same as China,” he said. “The G77 [which comprises most of the biggest developing economies] is not the same as the Alliance of Small Island States [which stand to lose most if engulfed by sea level rises]. Arabian countries [rich in oil] have different interests.” Rapidly developing economies want to use more fossil fuels to grow, and oil-rich countries want to be allowed to exploit their resources, but the poorest countries which have little of the infrastructure needed to cope with climate change are likely to be worst affected. Yet at the UN talks developing countries are often seen negotiating as a bloc, at least at first. Calderón’s warning was repeated privately by several developed country negotiators at the talks. “This is the point at which you begin to see the differences - the G77 are not united, they do not have the same interests,” said one. Another said: “We are having meetings with these countries individually, and they are not all on the same line.” Differences among developing countries are an important issue in crafting a deal. Todd Stern, the US special envoy for climate change, told journalists that a “coalition of high ambition” was being assembled, from the developed and developing world. He borrowed the phrase from the UK minister Greg Barker, who attended a previous round of talks in 2011 at Durban at which the timetable for a deal in Paris was hammered out. At that conference, the EU managed to pull together a broad but fragile coalition of the least developed countries of the world, many rapidly emerging economies, and rich nations. By the end of marathon negotiating sessions aimed in Durban at setting the goal of a global agreement to be signed in 2015 - which was the genesis of the current talks - every country but China and India was in favour. Those two finally agreed more than 36 hours after the talks deadline. It was remarkable because in previous talks China and India had led coalitions of developing countries, but at Durban they ended up isolated from traditional allies. The French hosts are hoping that these talks will show more unity before Friday, when they are scheduled to end. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU’s climate commissioner, said the EU was playing its part, holding bilateral meetings with a variety of nations, including China. Calderon praised the French hosts of the talks for managing the negotiating process. “They have done incredibly good diplomacy, in difficult circumstances,” he said. “They have taken all points of view, from all players. I hope they succeed.” But he said some developing countries were likely to cause difficulties. He suggested that Bolivia, which helped to block a formal agreement at Copenhagen in 2009, was one such. “Ideology defeats ideas for the Bolivians. I talked to them before the COP. It was a very disappointing meeting. Bolivia opposed the whole argument.” Negotiators report that Bolivia tends to begin each meeting with a long peroration on Mother Earth. Some find it frustrating - “we are all here because we want to save the planet, but we have business to do” - but one told the Guardian: “You have to listen to them, and understand where they are coming from, and find common ground.” Calderón had an important message for the French hosts. At UN climate meetings, a consensus is required before any resolution or agreement can be passed. But in preparation for Cancún, in 2010, Calderón consulted experts in international law and found that “consensus does not have to mean unanimity”. At Copenhagen, developed and developing countries agreed jointly for the first time to limits on greenhouse gas emissions under the UN framework. But because of blocking tactics by a small number of countries - including Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua - those targets and the declaration made by world leaders could not be formally incorporated into the UN process. Calderón, who managed to formalise those commitments in Cancún, said that international law allowed for the French hosts to “declare” when a consensus had been reached, even if some countries were holding out. “It takes a lot of discipline and patience [to craft a COP agreement],” he said. “There are cultural needs to understand. This is not an environmental issue - it is a diplomacy issue.”"

"It’s as if it had come to remind us of what’s at stake. While the climate negotiations in Paris trudge their dreary road, Storm Desmond takes a great boot to our backsides. Yet still we fail to make the connection. The news records the spectacle and ignores the implications. Flooding on this scale used to be described as a “once in 100 years”, or 200 years event. But in Cumbria, where some 30cm of rain fell in 24 hours, this is the third such catastrophe since 2005. Exceptional events are, perhaps, no longer exceptional. If so, we should scarcely be surprised. More heat means more energy in the system, and more moisture in the atmosphere. An analysis by scientists at the Met Office, published last month, found that global warming raised the odds – by a factor of seven – that a string of storms of the kind the UK suffered two winters ago would result in exceptionally wet weather. Just as remarkable is the collective lack of interest in what happens when rain hits the ground. The government boasts that: “We are spending £3.2bn in flood management and defences over the course of this parliament – half a billion pounds more than in the previous parliament.” Yet almost all the money devoted to freshwater flood relief is being spent at the bottom of river catchments. This means waiting until the wall of water arrives before seeking to contain it; a perfect formula for disappointment. A rational policy would aim to prevent the flood from gathering in the first place. It would address the problem, literally and metaphorically, upstream. A study in mid-Wales suggests that rainwater’s infiltration rate into the soil is 67 times higher under trees than under sheep pasture. Rain that percolates into the ground is released more slowly than rain that flashes off the surface. But Cumbria’s hills are almost entirely treeless, and taxpayers, through the subsidy regime, fund farmers to keep them that way. Rivers that have been dredged and canalised to protect farmland rush the water instead into the nearest town. Engineering works of this kind were removed a few years ago from the river Liza in Ennerdale. It was allowed to braid, meander and accumulate logs and stones. When the last great storm hit Cumbria, in 2009, the Liza remained clear and fordable the following day, while other rivers roared into furious spate. The Liza’s obstructions held the water back, filtered it and released it slowly. Had all the rivers of Cumbria been rewilded in this way, there might have been no floods, then or now. During the last deluge, in the winter of 2013-2014, the government’s Environment Agency published a presentation called River Dredging and Flood Defence. It remarked that “Dredging of river channels does NOT prevent flooding during extreme river flows.” Dredging, it noted, makes rivers more dangerous, destabilises bridges, banks and weirs and requires endless expense to maintain. All copies of this presentation have now been deleted from the web (we republish it above). It is not hard to see why. In June 2014, in pursuit of its primary mission – appeasing the farming industry – the environment department proposed to deregulate dredging, allowing landowners to strip the structure and wildlife habitat out of ditches and rivers. It would also permit them, with minimal oversight, to extract gravel from the riverbeds and to build culverts. There could be no better formula for disaster downstream. Once water is in the rivers, it has to go somewhere. If you don’t hold it back in the fields, it will tumble into people’s homes instead. But no one in power seems interested in the causes; all focus is on the outcomes. For the past three years, Cumbria’s two most prominent MPs, Rory Stewart, now a minister at the environment department, and Tim Farron, leader of the Lib Dems, have denounced those who call for the better management of watersheds to prevent flooding. In 2013, Rory Stewart blasted the National Trust because it “allows water to ruin the lowland pastures of their small tenant farms, apparently on the advice of the Environment Agency”. In 2014, he mocked the RSPB and the water company United Utilities for managing their land “in a way that ‘increased biodiversity, decreased flooding, increased carbon capture’”. In 2013, Tim Farron pronounced himself “delighted that Natural England are readjusting their approach to the uplands, with the recent dropping of their Uplands Vision”. This vision (called Vital Uplands) proposed that there should be more vegetation in the hills to reduce “the risk of downstream flooding”. It noted that “intensive grazing can cause soil erosion and compaction, and prevent regeneration of scrub and trees, thus speeding water run-off”. The report was publicly denounced by the head of Natural England (the government body that commissioned it), who happened to make his living as a farmer. Again, the online version was deleted and the hard copies were pulped. Is this how democracies behave? Now Messrs Stewart and Farron wring their hands and wring out their clothes, lamenting this inexplicable act of God. On Saturday, Tim Farron was trapped in the floodwaters while driving his car, and had to be rescued. The car, apparently, is a write-off. There is relief that he and his four children came to no harm. Still, parables have been told about men like him. Meanwhile, the talks in Paris have become a festival of empty gestures. The pledges governments have brought fall short of those required to prevent disasters on a much greater scale, and even they are broken as they are made. By pursuing a new dash for gas, while closing down its carbon capture and storage, renewable power and energy efficiency programmes, David Cameron’s government makes a mockery of its promises. Worse still, the collective refusal even to discuss keeping fossil fuels in the ground condemns the talks to futility. Nothing is learnt, crucial discussions are avoided or buried. We are drowning in ignorance; ignorance manufactured by an illiterate media and a hostile government. Every time disaster strikes we respond with bewilderment. Our understanding of what confronts us seems scarcely to have advanced since we responded to catastrophe by burning old women. • A fully linked version of this article can be found at Monbiot.com."

"Governments including China, India, the US and companies such as Ikea are backing a plan to have 10bn super efficient light bulbs fitted worldwide to tackle the 5% of global emissions caused by lighting. The public-private partnership is expected to see India sell 0.8bn LED bulbs by 2019 and China committing to sell 5bn by 2018.  Ikea, the Swedish furniture multinational, committed to sell 500m LED bulbs to its customers by 2020.  The Swedish energy minister, Ibrahim Baylan, told the Guardian that the scheme had been an outgrowth of innovations in the lighting sector this decade. “New lighting creates new opportunities in our societies with multiple benefits,” he said. “Sweden wants to support the transition to universal access of high-efficient and high-quality lighting, which is why we join this race with other Clean Energy Ministerial partners to realise the efficiency potential that exists in Sweden and the rest of the world.” The US energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, will also be endorsing the project which is backed by 13 major economies – including Australia, the UK and Mexico – and the European commission. Lighting accounts for around 15% of the world’s electricity consumption, more than the combined output of all the planet’s nuclear plants. That demand is set to rise 50% by 2030 as the world’s population grows, urbanisation increases and 1.2 billion people who currently lack access to energy grids get connected. Equally though, an overnight transition to LED lighting could save about 735m tonnes of carbon emissions, which is enough to displace nearly 250 coal-fired power plants around the world. The initiative is thus being presented as a race against time. “If we have 20 years of the global carbon budget left, we need to create products that are fantastically energy efficient and roll them out to scale very fast,” said Steve Howard, Ikea’s chief sustainability officer.  Ikea converted its entire lighting range to LEDs in September, and says that it expects its contribution to the project to save enough energy to power half a million homes each year. The Swedish firm’s LED sales promotion strategy currently includes giving a euro to pay for sustainable lighting for refugees, each time an LED is bought. High Street LED prices have fallen by four-fifths since 2012, but the lights are still more than twice the price of their competitors, even if they use 85% less electricity and can last for up to 20 years. Howard said: “A year or two ago, people were still used to paying 50p for a lightbulb so they didn’t get the value proposition. But 18 months ago, we suddenly got to the price point where there was a massive response from our customers and sales took off.” Industry leaders such as Philips, Osram, Cree and Enervee have also made private commitments to back the blueprint for affordable but climate-friendly illumination. The US has seen a six-fold increase in LED home lighting in just two years, saving Americans $1.4bn in energy bills last year alone, according to the country’s Department of Energy."
"You don’t need to be in Paris this week to get in on the climate change conversation. Watching modern explorers attempt to get to the North Pole while an ice cap melts around them might be enough to get even the staunchest of global warming apologists thinking. That’s the set-up for Melting: Last Race to the Pole, a reality show/expedition that details what its creators are claiming could be the final trip to the North Pole before the impact of climate change makes the journey impossible.  “The ice this year is so different from what I’ve experienced in the past,” says seasoned polar explorer Eric Larsen in a new Animal Planet special premiering on Wednesday. In vertiginous footage, he bounces up and down on a sheet of Arctic ice so compromised it responds like a water bed – just moments before his partner Ryan Waters falls through.  The two-hour documentary follows Larsen and Waters on their 2014 attempt to break the record for the fastest human-powered traverse to the North Pole. But the race against the 2006 benchmark of 49 days, set by a Norwegian team, quickly becomes a struggle to ski, trudge and, eventually, swim their way across the rapidly changing Arctic. As Larsen describes it: “Take the hardest thing that you could possibly imagine – do that for 40 days. Then make it twice as hard and keep going.” In reality-TV superlatives, Animal Planet has billed it as the most difficult and dangerous expedition on Earth. Bombast aside, Larsen and Waters’ 480-mile race is one of the world’s strongest tests of human willpower. The three other teams on the ice with them that spring were evacuated, and no one has completed the crossing since. And it’s possible that no one ever will. This year, peak Arctic sea ice was the lowest on satellite record. Around the same time this year, two climate change researchers on an Arctic expedition they called the Last Ice Survey disappeared, presumed drowned. Their gear and despondent sled dog were found next to a large hole in the ice. In fact, the ice has become so hazardous that the private airline that flew all expeditions to the starting point on Ellesmere Island has ceased operations. “The biggest non-event in expedition history is happening,” Larsen said. “And no one knows about it.”  When famed Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen completed the first documented expedition to the North Pole in 1926, he did so with a 16-man team and the help of the airship Norge, from which he deposited his national flag on to the ice below. It wasn’t until 1990 that any explorer reached the pole unsupported. Since then, fewer than 50 people have completed the crossing under their own power and without aid. Considering how recently humans managed this feat, it’s a bit alarming to think that the window for Arctic exploration might already have closed. “It’s very clear to me this is the last expedition of its kind,” says Larsen in the film, after finding the last few miles of ice divided by open water. It should have been too early for conditions like this. “It’s overwhelming. I don’t think we’re going to make the North Pole.” Filming their own, already challenging and dangerous expedition was an added hazard, says Larsen, who also blogged their journey. The several cameras they carried would freeze unless kept inside their long underwear. For any shot including the two of them, they had to go back for the camera, effectively tripling the distance they traveled. “When you’re cold and tired and hungry, the last thing you want to do is pull out a camera,” Larsen said. But for the sake of the Arctic, we should be glad they did. It might be the last opportunity to witness a journey of this kind. Melting: Last Race to the Pole airs Wednesday 9 December at 9pm ET on Animal Planet"
"Australia has warned against stripping the Paris climate agreement of ambition in order to get some kind of deal as negotiators met to consider yet another draft agreement. Speaking of behalf of the so-called umbrella group of developed countries – which includes the US, Canada, Japan and New Zealand – Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Peter Woolcott, said the group had significant concerns the draft was “not balanced”.  On each of the three points central to the political deal – the finance provided by rich countries to developing nations, the demand that all countries eventually report and review their emission reductions in the same way and the overall ambition of the agreement – both ambitious and weak options remain in the text. But developed country negotiators argue it has been “slanted” towards the developing country concerns. Woolcott said there were particular concerns about the longstanding issue of “differentiation” – the different requirements of rich and poor countries enshrined in the original 1992 climate convention which rich nations argue no longer reflect the world’s economy or its greenhouse emissions. He said it was critical the Paris agreement did not bind the world into “static categories”. Developing countries reacted relatively positively to the draft, with China saying it was “open and balanced” and South Africa, on behalf of the G77 group of developing countries (which now numbers 134) saying it was “a good basis on which to continue our negotiations”. After more than 20 years of negotiations, including eight days of talks in a conference hall outside Paris, the next 48 hours are seen as crunch time in reaching a deal to avoid dangerous temperature rise. With the release of the latest draft agreement by the French hosts on Wednesday afternoon, governments were meeting late into the night to try to strike an agreement before the scheduled end of talks on Friday. Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said the draft was the “starting point for the end negotiations” and she remained “hopeful we will see an ambitious, enduring agreement”. The latest draft agreement recognised a key demand of more than 100 countries to limit warming to 1.5C above industrial levels, which scientists think will assure a better chance of survival for low-lying countries. After years of fierce argument, pitting rich countries against poor, negotiators and campaigners described a spirit of cooperation and willingness to tackle climate change – symbolised by a US pledge of $860m in climate aid to poor countries, a doubling of its existing commitments. The US and the EU joined some African and Latin American countries in a powerful “high ambition coalition”, bringing countries within sight of an agreement. But the rising economies of China, India, Brazil and South Africa were noted hold-outs – especially on the 1.5C goal. “There are some countries who seek a more minimalist outcome,” Todd Stern, the state department envoy told negotiators. “We need a figure of 1.5c.” Anote Tong, the president of the low-lying Pacific island state of Kiribati, said he remained upbeat. “I’ve always said we need to come away from Paris with a deal that would ensure the survival of people,” Tong told the Guardian. “Nobody left behind – that’s the mission all along. This is quite a long way from where we started. It’s coming together.” But the action plans submitted so far by some 186 countries were still likely to result in temperature rise of close to 3C, and the 29-page text lacked specifics on how to ratchet up emissions cuts among developed countries and channel more climate finance to the developing world. Miguel Aria Cañete, the EU energy commissioner, acknowledged the gaps. “The text is not bold enough as it stands,” he said. “We will work to improve it. We invite other countries to join us. Oxfam’s international director, Helen Szoke, said: “There is still a long way to go: this is crunch time. The chance to set new funding targets from when the Paris deal comes into force in 2020 is still very much on the table and needs to stay there if developing countries are to have any hope of more support in the years ahead.”  She said countries needed to improve emissions reductions within the next five years to have any chance of limiting dangerous warming. Mary Robinson, the former Ireland president and a campaigner for climate justice, said there was at present nothing in the current draft which would stop countries from reaching the new lofty 1.5C goal. But the deal remained in a state of limbo – high hopes, but little prospect of getting there unless governments agreed to take tough decisions in the next few years. “There is still a lot of work to do but the good options are still in there,” Robinson said. “We can get a very good robust climate agreement if they make the right choices.” Unlike earlier climate negotiations, there was a strong concerted push from the US, Europe and some of the world’s poorest countries to try to strike a deal. Earlier on Wednesday, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, made a passionate appeal to countries to rally around a climate deal, sweetening the pot with an offer to double existing levels of aid to countries on the frontline of climate change. The White House said the US would deepen its commitment to help low-lying and poor countries that are already threatened by rising seas and powerful storms. “We need to get the job done,’’ Kerry said in a hard-hitting speech to the Paris meeting, “This moment demands we do not leave Paris without a durable ambitious climate agreement.” As President Barack Obama worked the phones from Washington, calling the leaders of India and Brazil, Kerry praised countries moving towards renewable energy and proffered more aid to countries already living with the impacts of climate change on the ground.  “There are countries we know for which climate change is an existential threat today,” he said. “We have a moral responsibility today to adapt and prepare for those impacts.” He said the US would double existing $430m budget for adaptation by 2020, and the funds would come in addition to $3bn the US pledged to the green climate fund, which will focus more on helping countries move to green energy and cut emissions."

"Worldwide greenhouse gas emissions will fall in 2015, researchers have said, in what would mark the first time they have declined while the economy has grown substantially. Emissions have fallen in previous years but only because of financial crashes, such as the global slump in 2007. But a decline in coal consumption by China, the world’s carbon juggernaut responsible for more than a quarter of emissions, means global levels are projected to fall 0.6% this year. China’s own emissions are expected to drop 3.9% in 2015, after a decade of rising by nearly 6.7% a year. The figures, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, will provide a fillip to negotiators from 195 countries entering a second week of climate talks in Paris on Monday.  But the paper’s authors warned the fall may only be temporary and that a switch away from fossil fuels to clean sources of energy needs to be accelerated if dangerous warming is to be avoided. “One wonders: is this peak emissions? It depends in large part in the immediate term on what happens in China, and how they deal with their economy instability and restructuring, what they call the ‘new normal’,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia and author on the paper. “The Chinese themselves think their emissions are going to go up. So the prognosis for global emissions is also probably for resuming an upward trajectory.” Rapid growth in emissions in other emerging countries dependent on coal, such as India, means that emissions are likely to go upward again in a few years. India, despite having a similar population to China, emits the same amount of greenhouse gases as China did 25 years ago.  “If history repeats itself and India becomes the new China in five-10 years, then the [global] emissions go up again,” said Le Quéré. India has emerged as a key player at the Paris talks. Prime minister, Narendra Modi, has simultaneously pushed solar power as a way to cut emissions – signing up a global alliance of 120 countries to back the technology – as well as signalling India would not accept curbs on its development.  The new paper shows that Indian emissions in 2015 are likely to have shot up 6.7% this year. Millions are still without access to electricity in India, and coal is expected to provide much of that new power. Le Quéré said that while the global picture in 2015 was a welcome change to recent years of high growth, if emissions continue at such a level they would lead to disastrous warming, of 3-4C above pre-industrial levels. “It’s really, really large warming. It means fundamental changes in rainfall patterns ... coastal areas would be impacted by sea level rises, both these things are pointing to increased risks of floods. That kind of warming level has a really strong influence on ecosystems and influence on risks for a range of pest and disease outbreaks.” World leaders have agreed at previous climate talks to limit warming to 2C, and some countries at the current summit, including France and Germany, are fighting to have a goal of 1.5C enshrined in any Paris agreement. “3-4C is pulling out the Earth really far from its natural equilibrium with the society and the way we have nature in relative balance now,” Le Quéré said. “2C is already pulling it away but at least it’s not too much of a stretch. 3-4C is really big.” However, the study did highlight signs of hope for bringing emissions from the power sector and industry down to zero, which is where scientists believe they must be by 2070 to avoid warming of more than 2C. Solar and wind are highlighted as particular successes, with the amount of wind power installed in 2014 the same as the entire world capacity a decade ago. Nuclear is described as having been “less successful” in cutting emissions due to a stall in global capacity, while the report notes that “little progress” has been made on other technologies, such as carbon carbon and storage. “Is this the beginning of the end of global warming? Probably not. But let’s hope it is the end of the beginning,” said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the paper. The study, Reaching Peak Emissions, said that emissions in 2015 were projected to be 35.7 gigatonnes (GT) of CO2 in 2015, down from 35.9 GT CO2 in 2014. Last year’s stall happened despite global economic growth of 3.3-3.4% a year during 2012-2014, and this year’s decline with a forecast of economic growth at 3.1% in 2015. Richard Black, director of the UK-based thinktank, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “This indicates that the old assumption of economic growth being dependent on rising fossil fuel use is broken. It should cheer anyone concerned that climate change might be insoluble, and encourage ministers meeting at the UN climate summit in Paris that pragmatic curbs on their carbon emissions are compatible with economic development.” More than 185 countries submitted plans to cut emissions for the Paris climate talks, where ministers this week hope to reach a deal on Friday for cuts beyond 2020.  Le Quéré said of the Paris summit: “It is super important. Not in the next five years. The next five years is already in train. But for what happens beyond 2020, and whether India does take the place of China as the biggest driver of emissions growth, Paris is going to be fundamental. “If Paris does have a five-year review process [something the US, France and China have called for], that’s going to have a very important influence on the [emissions] trajectory.” A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “The review reinforces our commitment to ensure we reduce all emissions at their source ... that’s why we are seeking an ambitious a global deal in Paris to reduce the risks of delaying action on climate change for future generations.”  Energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, is attending meetings at the Paris talks from Monday."
"An undercover sting by Greenpeace has revealed that two prominent climate sceptics were available for hire by the hour to write reports casting doubt on the dangers posed by global warming. Posing as consultants to fossil fuel companies, Greenpeace approached professors at leading US universities to commission reports touting the benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels and the benefits of coal. The views of both academics are well outside mainstream climate science.   The findings point to how paid-for information challenging the consensus on climate science could be placed into the public domain without the ultimate source of funding being revealed. They come as government ministers meet in Paris this week to try to reach an agreement to fight climate change, and one month after it emerged that ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy were under investigation in the state of New York over claims of misleading the public and investors about climate change. Over the course of their investigation, Greenpeace posed as the representative of a Middle Eastern oil and gas company and an Indonesian coal company. In the guise of a Beirut-based business consultant they asked William Happer, the Cyrus Fogg Brackett professor of physics at Princeton University, to write a report touting the benefits of rising carbon emissions, according to email exchanges between the professor and the fake company. Happer is one of the most prominent climate sceptics in the US and on Tuesday was called to testify at a congressional hearing into climate “dogma” convened by Ted Cruz, the Republican presidential candidate and chair of the Senate science committee. He is also chairman of the George Marshal Institute in the US and an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the UK. Reacting to the sting at the UN climate talks in Paris, US secretary of state John Kerry was dismissive of the impact of such paid-for work. “One professor or one scientist is not going to negate peer-reviewed scientists by the thousands over many years and 97% of the scientists on the planet,” he said. The proposed report for the fake consultant was intended to highlight the negative aspects of the climate agreement being negotiated in Paris, he was told in the email approach. The physicist was receptive to the commission, and asked to donate his fee to the CO2 Coalition, a group founded this year to “shift the debate from the unjustified criticism of CO2 and fossil fuels”. “My activities to push back against climate extremism are a labor of love, to defend the cherished ideals of science that have been so corrupted by the climate change cult,” he wrote in an email. He did not respond to a request from the Guardian for comment. The campaign group assumed another false identity, posing as an Indonesian energy consultancy, to approach Frank Clemente, a retired sociologist formerly at Pennsylvania State University, to commission a report countering damaging studies on Indonesian coal deaths and promoting the benefits of coal, according to the email exchanges. In both cases, the professors discussed ways to obscure the funding for the reports, at the request of the fake companies. In Happer’s case, the CO2 Coalition which was to receive the fee suggested he reach out to a secretive funding channel called Donors Trust, in response to a request from the fake Greenpeace entity to keep the source of funds secret. Not disclosing funding in this way is not unlawful under US law. Also, in an email exchange with the fake business representative, Happer acknowledges that his report would probably not pass peer-review with a scientific journal – the gold-standard process for quality scientific publication whereby work is assessed by anonymous expert reviewers. “I could submit the article to a peer-reviewed journal, but that might greatly delay publication and might require such major changes in response to referees and to the journal editor that the article would no longer make the case that CO2 is a benefit, not a pollutant, as strongly as I would like, and presumably as strongly as your client would also like,” he wrote. He suggested an alternative process whereby the article could be passed around handpicked reviewers. “Purists might object that the process did not qualify as a peer review,” he said. “I think it would be fine to call it a peer review.” Greenpeace said its investigation demonstrated how, unbeknownst to the public, the fossil fuel industry could inject paid-for views about climate change into the international debate, confusing the public and blocking prospects for strong action to avoid dangerous warming. “Our research reveals that professors at prestigious universities can be sponsored by foreign fossil fuel companies to write reports that sow doubt about climate change and that this sponsorship will then be kept secret,” said John Sauven, the director of Greenpeace UK. “Down the years, how many scientific reports that sowed public doubt on climate change were actually funded by oil, coal and gas companies? This investigation shows how they do it, now we need to know when and where they did it.” Such practices are receiving greater scrutiny in academic circles after it emerged that Dr Willie Soon, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who rejects mainstream climate science, was financed almost entirely by fossil fuel companies and lobby groups and a foundation run by the ultra-conservative Koch brothers. The Smithsonian launched an investigation.  In Happer’s case, the physicist declined any personal remuneration for his work but wanted his fee donated to the CO2 Coalition. Happer wrote in an email that his fee was $250 an hour and that it would require four days of work – a total of $8,000. “Depending on how extensive a document you have in mind, the time required or cost could be more or less, but I hope this gives you some idea of what I would expect if we were to proceed on some mutually agreeable course,” he wrote. Clemente, who was approached by the sham Indonesian firm to produce a report countering findings linking coal to high rates of premature death, said such a project fell within his skill set. He estimated a fee of about $15,000 for an eight-to-10-page paper, according to email correspondence released by Greenpeace. The professor said he charged $6,000 for writing newspaper opinion pieces. He said there was no problem quoting him as professor emeritus at Penn State, or obscuring the funding for the research. “There is no requirement to declare source funding in the US. My research and writing has been supported by government agencies, trade associations, the university and private companies and all has been published under the rubric of me as an independent scholar – which I am.” Clemente told the Guardian that he acted as a consultant to “many industries that improve the human quality of life”. He added: “I fully stand behind every single statement I made in my emails. I am very proud of my research and believe that clean coal technologies are the pathway to reliable and affordable electricity, reduction of global energy poverty and a cleaner environment.” “I write is an independent scholar and University is not responsible for any of my work. This is called academic freedom in the United States,” he said. Greenpeace said it had approached a total of seven prominent figures in the US and UK climate denial movement. The other five declined, either citing time pressures and area of expertise, or just did not respond. Greenpeace argues its investigation offered a rare glimpse into the practice of clandestine industry funding of reports casting doubts about the threat of climate change. The campaign group argues that obscuring funding in this way dupes the public into thinking the reports are produced by the scholars independently with no financial interests at stake. Happer, who served as an energy adviser for former president George HW Bush, has long argued that rising carbon emissions are a net benefit for humanity. He returned to the point in his email exchanges with the fake entity, saying: “The Paris climate talks are based on the premise that CO2 itself is a pollutant. This is completely false. More CO2 will benefit the world.” Naomi Oreskes, a science historian at Harvard University and author of Merchants of Doubt, a book about the climate denial movement, said Happer had been deploying the same arguments that CO2 is good for agriculture for about 20 years – even though such claims have, she said, been thoroughly debunked. “He has been recycling refuted arguments for quite some time now,” she said. “Happer sits in the profile of people we wrote about in Merchants of Doubt,” she said. “I’ve always argued that for this group of people, cold war physicists, it’s not about money, it’s ideologically driven.” Meanwhile, Peabody Energy regularly cites Clemente’s research to make its case that expanding coal use to developing countries would help eliminate global poverty. That argument runs counter to the thinking of financial institutions such as the World Bank which has rejected the notion of coal as a poverty cure. Happer noted he had also donated an $8,000 fee from Peabody for testimony in a Minnesota state hearing on the impacts of carbon dioxide to the CO2 Coalition. Happer did not dispute the veracity of the emails, but refused to address questions.  "

"A weak agreement remains the greatest danger for the Paris climate talks, with negotiators confident some kind of deal will be reached before next weekend despite little concrete progress and continued trenchant disagreements on most issues. The Paris summit is now entering its final week – when ministers and high level officials take over the negotiating lead under the French presidency.  The final agreement will be a political trade-off over the issues that have been dividing negotiators – so the document that will be handed to the French on Saturday remains to the lay-observer a hopeless scramble of options in brackets, indicating disagreement. But the senior negotiators believe there will be a way through. US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern said “a high-ambition coalition” was emerging, which “includes many countries” but not all of the 195 countries in the talks. He said the United States was now “really focused on getting that kind of strong agreement that is not watered down and does not kind of go to a lowest-common denominator or a minimalist agreement.” And Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN convention on climate change, said the talks were “where we thought they could be”. One impasse in the talks so far is about whether the document should mention that the latest science says the world should be aiming to limit global warming at 1.5 degrees, with Saudi Arabia and India flatly refusing attempts to even “reference” a UN study saying a 1.5 degree target was safer than 2 degrees.  There are also divisions over suggestions big developing countries should join rich countries to make financial contributions to help poor countries reduce their emissions and cope with the impacts of locked-in climate change. Stern told reporters some countries had “overread” the issue. He said it was about recognising what was already happening - China pledged US$3.1 billion in support to developing countries, when president Xi met president Obama at the White House - rather introducing any requirement he said. There is also intense disagreement over the agreement is worded in a way that would bind rich countries to specific continued investments, beyond the deal struck in Copenhagen for $100bn a year in public and private money to flow by 2020. (An OECD review said around $60bn was already committed, but poor countries dispute the calculations) But Stern said the US believed clear rules for monitoring and verifying where countries were meeting their greenhouse gas reduction targets “was an an enormously important part of this agreement, really one of the central parts of this agreement.” “When you think we have 184 targets put forward ... the transparency regime is the thing that will allow everyone to have trust that others are acting ... transparency is vital,” he said. Some countries, including China and India, have also raised concerns about the idea of five yearly reviews of countries’ targets – the mechanism that it is hoped will help increase their ambition to meet even the goal of containing global warming to 2 degrees.  The final deal is likely to be a trade-off between the rich countries demands for monitoring and oversight of all countries’ efforts and the developing world’s need for financing. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said he had appointed high level ambassadors to try to move things forward before negotiators hand over the text containing what agreement they have managed to achieve. China was widely blamed for the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen meeting, but in Paris Fabius said China had “so far played an extremely positive role.” This time Saudi Arabia is taking its traditional hard line stance and India is playing what one negotiator described as a “blocking role”."
"The survival of seabirds including puffins and kittiwakes on St Kilda – the island archipelago home to one of the world’s most important seabird populations – is being threatened by climate change, striking new evidence shows. Naturalists have discovered that the kittiwake, a small migratory gull with ink-black wing tips, is on the brink of disappearing from St Kilda. The remote cluster of Scottish islands in the eastern Atlantic is the UK’s only place with two Unesco world heritage site listings – for its culture and natural history – and one of only 24 sites with a dual listing worldwide.  The kittiwake did not breed in St Kilda this season, with just one chick born there this year after a 99% decrease in occupied nests since the 1990s. Its adult population has since halved. The number of fulmar chicks has plunged by 33% since 2005, while St Kilda’s puffin population is in persistent decline. Warming seas to the west of the Hebrides are believed to have driven the marine life the birds rely on further north into colder seas or deeper into the water, starving the birds of food.  The findings from the annual bird survey by the National Trust for Scotland, the charity which owns St Kilda, have alarmed conservationists. “This data from St Kilda is really extremely worrying,” said Dr Paul Walton, head of habitats and species in Scotland for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “We are losing whole colonies of these birds now and it’s a very serious issue. Frankly, it breaks my heart, it really does.” With crucial UN climate talks approaching their halfway point in Paris, the data underscored the case for urgent action on climate change, he said. Capping the growth in global temperatures at 2C – the target for policymakers – could be enough to allow the marine environment to adapt over time, Walton added.  “There’s a very strong climate change link here that needs to go straight to Paris: what they decide there is going to determine the future of our seabirds,” he said. “We are clear on what the science is saying, that really big ecology effects of climate change are unfolding in the marine environment around Scotland right now. It’s not coming, it’s here now.”  St Kilda – now regarded as one of the world’s most significant bird sanctuaries – was once inhabited by an isolated and beleaguered community whose songs and poetry heavily featured the seabirds they subsisted on before moving off the archipelago in 1930. It lies about 41 miles (66km) west of the Hebrides. When bird populations are at their highest, about 1 million birds perch on the island’s high, precipitous cliffs, sea stacs and rocky crags, hosting the world’s largest gannet colony and nearly a third of the charismatic Atlantic puffins that live around the UK and Ireland.    In 1987, the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) counted 7,829 kittiwakes on the islands. Now that number stands at 3,886. When routine monitoring began 21 years ago, there were 513 occupied kittiwake nests there, with 56 chicks born. This year, researchers found just four nests, a 99.2% decrease, and a single chick. The number of fulmar nests has declined by 37% since 2002, with productivity rates well below normal levels, averaging 0.28 chicks per nest compared with 0.42 in 2005.  Puffin numbers are also struggling. At 0.59 chicks per burrow, the NTS says puffin breeding is “still below the long-term average and, set against the longtime scale of the decline, suggests conditions are becoming less suitable for breeding”. Susan Bain, who manages the island for the NTS, has ruled out windfarms and overfishing as other causes for the birds’ decline. Studies of dead kittiwakes found they had not been eating their normal diet, suggesting fish had moved to follow the cooler waters.  Lighter and more buoyant than their neighbouring gannets, the birds struggled to dive to the necessary depths. As a result, dead chicks were found having digested non-nutritious pipefish.  “We’re seeing significant declines in the number of species, which suggests that there’s something changing in the seas,” Bain said. “We know the sea temperature is getting warmer, so the fish are moving or are at greater depths.”  Bain says the headline figures are worrying, given the island’s exceptional biological significance. But she is not concerned for its Unesco status, yet. “At the moment, no, I’m not worried, but I wouldn’t want to be complacent about that either,” she said. “If these declines continue, then maybe.” Regular, long-term visitors had noticed the kittiwake’s absence, she added. “We were seeing a couple of hundred nests around the village bay in the past. Now there are four, which is devastating. It’s very noticeable. They’re statistically extinct, although we will continue to look for them next year. “It is normally a noisy place. You walk up to the cliffs and put your head over and it’s constant noise of fulmars, guillemots and razorbills. When they leave and go out to sea it’s silent, you really do notice. It would change the nature of the place significantly if that soundtrack was gone.” "
"Oil tankers take a long time to turn around. The skyscraper-length ships carry so much weight and momentum that turning one 180 degrees takes at least 40 minutes even in calm seas. It is a fitting metaphor for the challenge our leaders face at the climate summit in Paris as they try to steer a new direction away from fossil fuels.  Decades of dirty energy investment, the dead-weight of vested interests, shifting political tides and – let’s be honest – cheap fossil fuel prices, mean that changing the world’s entire energy system to remove the carbon causing climate change will also be a slow turnaround.  Thankfully the world seems poised to chart a course for a cleaner energy future. This is not a moment too soon. If the international energy system continues on its present course, world temperatures could rise almost 3C by 2100. To avoid the consequences such a rapid climatic change could bring, global emissions need to peak and start to fall within the next few years. Campaigners will rightly point out this week that the commitments agreed in Paris do not add up to enough to avoid the dangerous 2C threshold. A legally binding agreement to rapidly and fairly reduce emissions – reflecting what the science tells us we need to do to avoid disaster – would be the perfect outcome. But that is simply not politically possible at the moment and we must not let the best, become the enemy of the good. We should not give up on the goal of a legal cap on global emissions that keeps us below 2C. But right now we just need to get things moving in the right direction.  The UN has done a good job of getting countries on board with the looser idea of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and I am hopeful that the deal reached next week will be a reasonably good one. But Paris is only the beginning of a slow transition from a fossil-fuelled world to one powered by clean technology. Implementing the pledges made in Paris will be crucial. To get that tanker turning we need a clear steer from governments. Our own included. That means strong and consistent policy. Governments in the UK have had a good record on climate leadership. The UK introduced the world’s first legally binding carbon budgets, the Scottish government set a target to go 100% renewable, and the present government’s recent ‘energy policy reset’ set a date to close the last of our polluting coal plants. The ‘reset’, however, does not provide the clear steer we need beyond Paris. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd envisages a new fleet of gas power stations to replace coal. Gas pumps out half the emissions of coal, at roughly 450 g CO2 per kilowatt hour (KWh), so this will deliver some savings in the short term. But these new power stations will last for decades and can only be consistent with our climate change targets if their emissions can be brought down to under 100g CO2 per KWh by the 2030s. That can only be achieved if technology is developed to capture and store the carbon pollution they produce. However, the energy department has pulled the plug on funding for a £1bn government competition to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) pilot projects. It was 10 years in the making, with companies only weeks away from submitting final entries. This latest policy reversal comes at a time when the energy industry’s trust in the government was already sinking. Since coming to power the government has also scrapped subsidies for renewables and ended the green deal for energy efficiency and planned regulation on zero carbon homes. This is extraordinarily short-sighted. Onshore wind farms and solar power are rapidly approaching cost parity with other forms of power, but they still need support. And the best way to cut carbon, while also reducing bills and enhancing our energy security, is to build energy efficient homes and businesses. This would save us all money and reduce the need for new gas power stations. Getting a good deal in the next two weeks is essential, but it represents only the first turn of the tanker’s wheel.  A clear and consistent steer from government is crucial to instil the confidence needed for the big investment decisions before the end of this decade to meet our carbon budgets. If the government locks us into 20th century fossil fuel technology now, we may be forced to make a more expensive emergency turnaround later.  The Kyoto protocol sank after it was agreed because governments did not commit to it, we must not let the same fate befall Paris. The move towards a sustainable energy system shouldn’t be seen as a cost to be avoided, but as an opportunity to innovate, create jobs and enrich our economy. We should join the rest of the world in charting a course for a clean energy future."

"Delegates from 195 countries at climate change talks in Paris are under pressure to produce a working text of a deal by Friday, exposing sticking points and fault lines nearly halfway through the UN negotiations. Developed countries, along with the French hosts and the UN, were mostly optimistic about signing a deal in advance of the landmark summit.   World leaders met on the first day, an unprecedented gathering of the heads of state and government of 150 countries, pledging their commitment to a legal outcome that would reaffirm the world’s collective action on greenhouse gas emissions. Developed countries – or most of them – came to the Paris climate change conference with a few clear priorities. They wanted to validate the emissions targets made by nearly all of the world’s governments; prove to developing countries that the flows of finance, mostly from the private sector, would be sufficient for the assistance they need; and ensure that the mechanisms for review, transparency, and accountability in meeting the emissions targets are sound. On the emissions targets, the omens were good. Nearly every country, developed and developing, produced a national plan – known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) – on curbing their emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments, agreed at Copenhagen in 2009, run out. Although rich countries have been criticised for not doing enough to keep global emissions below the levels likely to lead to dangerous climate change, they were fortified by analyses of the INDCs that the “emissions gap” could be met, with additional contributions from “non-state actors” such as cities, regional governments and businesses. In addition, they were proposing a mechanism of five-yearly reviews at which commitments could be ratcheted up, which would enable the target of limiting temperature rises to 2C to be met in future years. However, while the principle of five-yearly reviews was widely regarded as a useful and workable innovation, some countries have raised concerns. These include China, India, Middle Eastern countries and some of Latin America. For these countries, a five-year “stock take”, at which progress on targets could be discussed, is the preferred option. They argue that, as most have 2030 targets, these should be allowed to stand. But for countries such as the US, which has offered a 2025 target, a five-year review would be appropriate. Developed countries are resistant, still asking for a full review process rather than a mere stock take. “It’s about having a level playing field,” one delegate told the Guardian. “That’s an important principle.” Another said: “We don’t want to lock in modest ambition [by dropping five-year reviews].” This issue, along with the mechanisms for reporting and verifying that emissions reductions have truly been made, could yet provoke more controversy in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the talks. On finance, reports from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Resources Institute have suggested that climate finance is flowing to the poor at levels needed to meet the Copenhagen pledge of $100bn a year by 2020. Most of this is likely to come from the private sector, but rich country governments and international development banks, such as the World Bank, have fortified the prospects with raised pledges on finance, such as the UK’s promise of £5.8bn over this parliament. Critics say some of this money is being taken from other development aid budgets. The finance issue is likely to continue to be wrangled over into the closing days of the talks, as developing countries seek further assurances. Developed countries are holding firm on another controversial matter: loss and damage. This, according to the rich nations, is the principle that poor countries struck by disasters of climate-related extreme weather should receive special assistance, and they will commit to that. However, for some poor nations and NGOs, loss and damage is interpreted as being compensation owed to the developing world from the industrialised countries that have historically been most responsible for emissions. “We are not signing up to anything on compensation or liability,” one EU official said. The US is understood to take the same stance. Finally, a key risk as the talks grind on is that yet again, as at Copenhagen, they become bogged down in wrangles over details in the text. The draft text contains thickets of square brackets, denoting issues where wording has not yet been resolved, or where several options still remain to be decided upon. If these cannot be resolved in time, a text may not be ready for agreement, and the talks could fail. The French hosts, and the UN, have tried to avoid this by demanding the text be ready at an early stage – this weekend – before being passed to ministers for the political discussions that still need to be had among countries. To this end, they have introduced novel forums for discussion among delegates, such as a system of “informal informals” by which small groups of officials take passages of the text – often just a paragraph – and try to beat it into a shape acceptable to all. “France is acutely aware of the risks of process failure,” the EU official said. Getting a text into a workable format is now the top priority. Whether the compromises that are still possible will be enough to satisfy developing countries cannot yet be discerned. Some countries, including some Latin American, African and Middle Eastern delegations, have been privately indicating they are not happy with the way the talks have gone in their first week and may step up their rhetoric in the second week. India, which was late to produce its INDC and whose president, Narendra Modi, has been outspokenly critical of western countries, has been the subject of a charm offensive, including meetings with President Obama, David Cameron, and other high-ranking developed country officials, and from NGOs. At Durban, in 2011, the UN climate talks carried on until dawn on the final Sunday, some 36 hours after they were supposed to end, after a mammoth non-stop negotiating session. What was at stake was in fact whether the Paris conference would take place, and indeed the entire future of the UN process. Taking place in the shadow of the 2009 Copenhagen summit, which produced a deal but no legal agreement and ended in scenes of chaos, the Durban conference was unusually fraught, even by the standards of these long-running annual negotiations.  The EU had assembled a “coalition of ambition” at Durban, made up of most of the poorest countries on the planet, as well as the richest, to push for a new round of talks that would culminate in 2015, aimed at forging a legal agreement to come into force from 2020. Late into Saturday night, only two countries were holding out against that proposed timetable: China and India. In the end, they agreed to it. In the intervening years, China has re-gauged its stance, most notably in forming an unprecedented alliance last year with the US to announce joint commitments on emissions. But the interests of Delhi and Beijing are far from identical."
"The French hosts of the Paris climate change conference are moving “at breakneck speed” to reach a deal by the end of this week, incorporating targets on global emissions and financial help for developing countries. Ministers from countries including the UK have been appointed to head special working groups with the aim of producing a revised draft text of a possible agreement on Wednesday.  The ministers, most of whom have flown here in the last few days, are expected to resolve the political decisions – as opposed to technical issues on narrow questions of the wording and architecture of a deal – that still need to be taken. These political decisions include: the level of ambition to be set in terms of emissions limits; a long-term goal on limiting temperatures, potentially of 2C or 1.5C; mechanisms for reviewing emissions targets and financial flows every five years; and measures to ensure that all countries are transparent and accountable in their estimates of progress towards emissions goals. Of the eight ministers appointed, the UK’s Amber Rudd has been charged with overseeing how countries will meet their longstanding goals on emissions and finance up to 2020. The main body of the Paris agreement will deal with goals from 2020 onwards, when current commitments expire. “The French have started moving at breakneck speed,” one official said. “The text is the most manageable we’ve ever had in these proceedings. It’s clearly a step towards a landing ground.” Negotiators and ministers were required to work on Sunday, traditionally a day off from formal talks at these annual conferences. At Paris, governments are hoping to sign a deal on greenhouse gas emissions and finance for developing countries that will kick in from 2020. It is seen as a last chance for the UN process, which has been carrying on since 1992, as if an agreement is not reached then the world will have no plan for collective action to solve this global problem. Miguel Arias Canete, the EU’s climate change commissioner, said: “This [agreement] will shape the future of the world for decades. We have made great progress, but it is not yet enough.” Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who is presiding over the fortnight-long talks, told ministers on Monday that they were approaching the end of four years of tough negotiations. “The time for decisions has come on this universal, essential and even existential challenge: climate change. It is up to you to take these decisions. You are responsible for providing answers. Our time is very limited.” The talks are scheduled to end on Friday, but because of the cumbersome procedures required to pass a deal under the UN process, the French want to wrap up any remaining disagreements by Thursday. One of the key questions will be over how legally binding any deal will be. All of the major countries have been considering the draft text line by line, to decide which parts can be legally binding and which will not. One EU official told the Guardian that there had been no resolution yet of which parts of an agreement should be binding and which might have a lesser legal status, but nevertheless would be publicly stated commitments that any government would find difficult to renege upon. The EU wants emissions targets to be legally binding, but the US is unlikely to agree to this, or to have financial commitments enshrined in law. The White House is in a constrained position where legal commitments are concerned: anything termed a “treaty” would have to be passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, which is unlikely. But the US could agree to an over-arching architecture – including commitments such as a long-term goal on avoiding dangerous climate change – that is legally binding, with emissions and financial targets published in a separate document. Such an architecture is already used in other international agreements, including the Minamata convention on poisonous emissions of mercury. The Kyoto protocol of 1997, which required rich countries to cut their emissions by about 5.2% in total, was legally binding but was never passed by the US Congress. As a result, it only came into force in 2005 and many countries ignored its provisions, without sanctions. The Copenhagen declaration in 2009 was not a legally binding document, but its provisions – by which the world’s biggest developed and developing countries jointly agreed for the first time to emissions limits – are still in force."
"In 2008, a paper was published in the journal Nature predicting that global surface temperatures would cool slightly in the years 2005–2015 as compared to 1994–2004. The authors of that paper thought that during that time, the cool phase of natural ocean cycles would be enough to more than offset warming from the increased greenhouse effect, before human-caused global warming caught up again thereafter. At the time, the paper and its cooling prediction received a tremendous amount of media attention. There was some truth to the prediction. From about 1999 to 2012, there were more La Niña than El Niño events, with the former having a short-term cooling influence on global surface temperatures, and the latter having a short-term warming effect. So, it’s true that natural ocean cycles had a temporary cooling effect during that time period.  But, the authors of the paper predicted that global surface temperatures would fall. The climate scientists who blog at RealClimate were so confident that temperatures would continue to rise that they offered the authors a bet.  If the average temperature 2000-2010 (their first forecast) really turns out to be lower or equal to the average temperature 1994-2004, we will pay them € 2500. If it turns out to be warmer, they pay us € 2500. This bet will be decided by the end of 2010. We offer the same for their second forecast: If 2005-2015 turns out to be colder or equal compared to 1994-2004, we will pay them € 2500 – if it turns out to be warmer, they pay us the same.  The authors of the paper declined to accept the bet, which was a good decision, because it turns out they would have lost. Despite the temporary cooling influence of natural ocean cycles and low solar activity since 1999, temperatures have continued to rise due to the strength of the increased greenhouse effect. They have risen more slowly than they would have otherwise, but temperatures have continued to rise nevertheless. As the climate scientists at RealClimate wrote, It is clear that prediction of global cooling or even stasis was way off the mark, with global warming continuing and observations running more than 0.15ºC warmer than the Keenlyside et al forecast … Had our bet been accepted, it is clear we would have won unambiguously. One might ask, is it ever again going to be smart to bet against global warming? A paper published earlier this year in the Royal Society journal Philosophical Transactions A asked that very question. The authors looked at the global surface temperature data and considered whether for each 15-year period, a bet of warming or cooling as compared to the previous 15-year average would have won. The results, shown in the figure below, are strongly influenced by natural climate cycles. Betting on global surface cooling would have usually been a winner in 1880–1910 and 1950–1965. Wagering on global surface warming would have won the bet ever year from 1910 to 1940, and every year since 1970. The authors of the paper note it’s particularly interesting that global warming keeps winning the bet despite ocean cycles, solar activity, and human aerosol pollution all acting in the cooling direction over the past 15 years. Human-caused global warming has become so strong that it’s consistently overcoming these natural short-term cooling factors. The shift in odds to favour warming changes reflects the growing greenhouse contribution to 15-year trends. The greenhouse contribution is now about the same magnitude as typical naturally occurring 15-year trends … While it is still possible to get negative 15-year changes that will rely on large amplitude and less frequent natural triggers of 15-year changes such as large volcanoes or large amplitude negative [ocean cycle] events. In other words, betting against global warming is an almost sure way to lose money at this point. As I document in my book Climatology versus Pseudoscience, contrarians rarely predict global temperature changes, but those who do usually predict cooling, and their predictions have performed terribly. Much worse than global warming projections from mainstream climate models.  As the authors of this paper conclude, it may be the case that climate contrarians so rarely make temperature predictions, and almost never accept global temperature wagers, because deep down they know they’re wrong. What this means for the foreseeable future is that it is now very unlikely to win a bet that the next 15-year period is cooler than the previous one … the apparent gulf between climate contrarians (who say they expect little future warming) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (who project ongoing long-term warming) may be largely posturing on the part of the contrarians. Bets against greenhouse warming are largely hopeless now and that is widely understood."

"Nearly 200 governments homing in on a deal to fight climate change have set lofty aspirations for protecting vulnerable countries from rising seas, but delegates said there were still gaps in the latest draft of an agreement. After more than 20 years of negotiations, including eight days of talks in a conference hall outside Paris, the next 48 hours are seen as the crunch time in reaching a deal to avoid a dangerous rise in temperatures. With the release of the latest draft agreement by the French hosts on Wednesday afternoon, governments were expected to meet late into the night to try to strike a deal before the scheduled end of talks on Friday. The latest draft text recognised a key demand of more than 100 countries to limit warming to 1.5C above industrial levels, which scientists think will assure a better chance of survival for low-lying countries. After years of fierce argument, pitting wealthy against less wealthy countries, negotiators and campaigners described a spirit of cooperation and willingness to tackle climate change in Paris – symbolised on Wednesday by a US pledge of $860m (£566m) in climate aid to poorer countries, a doubling of its existing commitments. However, the rising economies of China, India, Brazil and South Africa were noted holdouts against the 1.5C goal. Todd Stern, the US State Department envoy, told negotiators: “There are some countries who seek a more minimalist outcome. We need a figure of 1.5C.” Anote Tong, the president of the low-lying Pacific island state of Kiribati, said he remained upbeat. “I’ve always said we need to come away from Paris with a deal that would ensure the survival of people. Nobody left behind – that’s the mission all along,” Tong told the Guardian. “This is quite a long way from where we started. It’s coming together.” But the action plans submitted so far by 186 countries were still likely to result in a temperature rise of close to 3C. The 29-page text, down from a 43-page version on Saturday, lacked specifics on how to ratchet up emissions cuts among developed nations and channel more climate finance to developing countries. The also US won a key victory when countries’ climate plans – known as INDCs in the UN jargon – were taken out from the main body of the text, something EU officials had previously said was a red line. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU energy commissioner, acknowledged the gaps. “The text is not bold enough as it stands,” he said. “We will work to improve it. We invite other countries to join us.” The European Union said the removal from the text of any reference to emissions from shipping and aviation betrayed “unacceptable levels of low ambition”. Australia complained about a “lack of balance” and Russia advised the only way forward was to re-negotiate the document line by line. Trinidad and Tobago’s delegate warned the Paris agreement would be “seriously flawed” if it did not stick to an ambitious 1.5C target to limiting warming. Barbados offered even stronger language, warning: “We will not sign off any agreement that represents a certain extinction of our people.”  South Africa said the text was a significant departure and dilution from principles that have guided the talks in the past. Helen Szoke, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said: “There is still a long way to go: this is crunch time. The chance to set new funding targets from when the Paris deal comes into force in 2020 is still very much on the table and needs to stay there if developing countries are to have any hope of more support in the years ahead.” She said countries needed to improve emissions reductions within the next five years to have any chance of limiting dangerous warming. There was nothing in the current draft that would stop countries adopting the 1.5C goal, said Mary Robinson, the former Irish president and a campaigner for climate justice. Despite this, the deal remains in a state of limbo: high hopes, but very little prospect of getting there unless governments agree to take tough decisions in the next few years. “There is still a lot of work to do, but the good options are still in there,” Robinson said. “We can get a very good robust climate agreement if they make the right choices.” Jennifer Morgan, the global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, a US-based thinktank, said: “All the elements for a strong and equitable agreement are still in the latest, shorter draft. There is clearly an immense amount of work to be done here in Paris, but things are starting to come together.” Youth climate activists and green campaigners at the talks staged a sit-in on Wednesday afternoon after the draft text was published. They clapped and chanted “we are unstoppable! Another world is possible” and held placards saying “justice, just transition” and “ambition: fair shares for 1.5C”. Friends of the Earth International, which took part in the protest, said the current draft failed communities on the frontline of climate change. However, environmental NGOs and other observers were broadly positive about the draft, although they reiterated that key issues still had to be addressed. Neil Thorns, the director of advocacy at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “A temperature limit of 1.5C is being put on the table, but it doesn’t mean anything until we get a clear plan on how the world would achieve it.” Celine Herweijer, a partner at PwC, said there was progress but added: “As to be expected, the more contentious issue of finance, loss and damage, differentiation, ambition and the long term goal of 1.5C-2C all still need to be agreed.” Unlike earlier climate negotiations, there was a strong concerted push from the US, Europe and some of the world’s least wealthy countries to try to strike a deal. Earlier on Wednesday, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, made a passionate appeal to countries to rally around a climate agreement, sweetening the deal with an offer to double existing levels of aid to countries on the frontline of climate change. The White House said the US would deepen its commitment to help low-lying and less wealthy countries already threatened by rising seas and powerful storms. “We need to get the job done,’’ Kerry said in a hardhitting speech to the Paris meeting. “This moment demands we do not leave Paris without a durable, ambitious climate agreement.” As Barack Obama worked the phones from Washington, calling the leaders of India and Brazil, Kerry praised countries moving towards renewable energy and proffered additional financial assistance to nations already living with the impact of climate change. “There are countries we know for which climate change is an existential threat today,” Kerry said. “We have a moral responsibility today to adapt and prepare for those impacts.” He said the US would double the existing $430m budget for adaptation by 2020 and that the funds would come in addition to $3bn the US pledged earlier to the Green Climate Fund, which will focus more on helping countries move to green energy and cut emissions. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said that a new draft would be published on Thursday afternoon, ahead of a “Paris Outcome” final agreement on Friday."
"The best city stories we’ve spotted around the web this week take a look at the rise of “companionship businesses” serving lonely city dwellers, discover an apartment building in Berlin where homes have been turned into storage units, hear stories of gentrification in Brooklyn and imagine a future where the top decks of London’s buses are reserved for the super wealthy. We’d love to hear your responses to these stories: just share your thoughts in the comments below.  “Why isn’t there a Starbucks for hugs?” That was the thinking behind Snuggle Buddies, a service offering people dedicated cuddling companions based in New Jersey. The company is one example in the growing trend of companionship businesses across the US. Not all of them simply include cuddling, of course; another service, RentAFriend, does pretty much what it says on the tin, hiring out people with whom you can just go for a walk or grab a coffee. According to its founder, Scott Rosenbaum, many of its customers are business travellers without friends in the cities they visit or people who just moved to a new area and don’t yet know anyone. “The advent of professional cuddling and friend rentals seems to be serving a distinctly modern need,” writes Olga Oksman in CityLab. “Everyone I talked to in the companionship industry echoed the same view that while digital technology may provide connection, it doesn’t provide physical touch and can’t replace real-life friendships.” And although cities are full of people, they can often be quite alienating places. Rosenbaum’s inspiration behind RentAFriend came from a similar service operating in Japan, “where social isolation is more common than in the US and where there are special cafes where lonely customers can drink coffee in the company of stuffed animals.” Grow Heathrow, a four-acre “off-grid” community which supports villages struggling against the expansion of nearby Heathrow airport on the outskirts of London, call themselves a “grassroots struggle against climate change”. While the COP21 talks continue in Paris, Al Jazeera takes a look at this example of climate change resistance playing out on the ground. Grow Heathrow produces its own power, uses recycled materials, grows food and distributes the surplus to nearby villages. Despite an ongoing High Court eviction case against them, activists at the site continue their work of “cultivating cultures of community resistance”. In New York City, every building with more than nine units has a caretaker, known as a “super”. Photographer Gesche Würfel was intrigued by the basement spaces these supers live and work in and set to record them, in their often shrine-like quality. “The supers tend to be migrants, especially from the Caribbean or Latin American countries,” she explains in an interview alongside a gallery of her pictures in Uncube. “They find ways to bring their home country into their space, by, for example, putting up pictures on the basement walls that depict scenes of their old homeland … Normally we think of basements as dark places that you don’t want to go to but these places were very inviting. It does seem that the idea of ‘storing an identity’ in terms of creating a sanctuary is an important thing.” In the city of Flint, Michigan, poisonous water was flowing out of taps for about 18 months. It still would be, were it not for a group of citizen activists who worked hard to prove their drinking water was unsafe. As Next City reports, there is an investigation under way into how officials managed to let their public consume poisonous water. Flint, a distressed community northwest of Detroit with about 100,000 people, has been in and out of emergency management since 2002. It was under the supervision of an emergency manager in April 2014, when the city made the ill-fated choice to use the Flint River for its water while a new regional water authority is being constructed, rather than sign a pricey short-term contract with Detroit, which had been providing it water for decades.  What if our London buses had exclusive areas for the “elite”? Artist Max Colson’s animated video takes us inside a vision of a public bus with a premium top deck and a budget area below. In the form of an advert, the work is a parody on what London’s current changes – privatisation, booming luxury real estate, foreign investment prioritised over homes for citizens – could result in. “In a political landscape that has seen the scrapping of the requirement to build affordable houses to rent, the demolition of social housing, and the rapid gentrification of some of the city’s poorest areas, we could just be looking to the future of London’s increasingly fragmented society,” Louise Benson writes in POSTmatter.  As property prices rise steeply, many are forced to live in ever smaller homes. But where’s the space for all their stuff? “The demand for storage spaces is on the rise, especially in dense capitalist metropolises,” writes Florian Heilmeyer in Uncube. “People need more and more space to keep the things they don’t need all the time but are too good to throw away.” Self storage is becoming increasingly popular, with dedicated buildings taking up space in city centres as well as outskirts – to the extent that in Berlin, a building that was designed as an apartment block for people to live in has now been converted into self-storage units. So, stuff trumps people – what’s next, storage cities? Alongside a brilliant op-ed about affordable housing in New York City, the New York Times shares personal stories of residents forced to relocate from their Crown Heights neighbourhood in Brooklyn due to the impacts of gentrification. In prewar apartments, glossy new kitchens are replacing tired old ones. Limestone fixer-uppers are commanding seven-figure prices. Cocktail bars are opening where fried chicken used to be sold from behind bulletproof glass. And the New Yorkers who lived there are drifting away, their former homes renovated to make way for white college graduates and young families.

"American Electric Power (AEP), one of the largest electricity utilities in the US, is to ditch its membership of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing organisation that has consistently opposed the deployment of renewable energy and action on climate change. A spokeswoman for AEP told the Guardian that the decision was made as the company attempts to help implement the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s strategy to curb carbon dioxide pollution from the nation’s power plants.  “We let (Alec) know that we won’t be renewing our membership in 2016,” she said. “We are reallocating our resources as we focus on our work with the states around the Clean Power Plan. There are a variety of reasons for the decision. We have long been involved in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.” AEP is the latest business to flee Alec, with Royal Dutch Shell specifically citing the controversial organisation’s stance on climate change as a reason for ending its membership. BP also recently ended its involvement with the free-market lobby group, while companies including Amazon, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Facebook and Google all left the organisation over its stance on gun control in the wake of the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin. Alec has backed legislation penalising homeowners who install solar panels, labelling them “free riders”, and has lobbied heavily against the Environmental Protection Agency, which is Barack Obama’s primary tool for reducing greenhouse gases, to the point of considering the agency’s complete elimination. Alec also disputes the theory that pesticides are harming bees.  The conservative group has rejected allegations it denies climate science but its official position on the issue states that climate change is “a historical phenomenon and the debate will continue on the significance of natural and anthropogenic contributions. “Unilateral efforts by the United States or regions within the United States will not significantly decrease carbon emissions globally, and international efforts to decrease emissions have proven politically infeasible and unenforceable,” the position statement added.  Campaign groups have repeatedly called on businesses to distance themselves from Alec at a time when the Republican party and associated conservative thinktanks are increasingly isolated in the global effort to head off the worst effects of climate change. The Union of Concerned Scientists has criticised Alec’s “extreme and non-science-based position on climate change” that it says is at odds with most large businesses. American Electric Power is the sixth-largest US electric utility by market capitalisation, with the company serving nearly 5.4 million customers in 11 states in the country’s midwest and south. The business, which has around 32,000 megawatts in generation capacity, insists it is on track to reduce its emissions by 25% by 2017, based on 2005 levels. Nearly three-quarters of AEP’s generation was supplied by coal in 2005 but this is expected to drop to 51% next year, with renewable energy such as wind and solar comprising 11% of generation. A company spokeswoman said AEP was previously concerned by the EPA’s plan to slash carbon emissions from power plants but only due to the pace of the proposed changes. AEP supports the EPA’s amended plan and the expansion of renewables in general, the spokeswoman added. Melinda Pierce, legislative director at environment group the Sierra Club, said: “AEP, a major American electric utility, is long past due in finally joining Google, eBay, Facebook, and even oil giants BP and Shell by cutting ties with this highly controversial organisation. “It’s time for other major companies like UPS, State Farm, and Pfizer to immediately follow suit and demonstrate their own corporate responsibility. Alec is determined to thwart or eliminate essential environmental safeguards that protect clean air, clean water, and our climate.” The news of AEP’s scrapped membership follows Alec’s states and nation policy summit, which concluded on Friday in Scottsdale, Arizona. The gathering featured a speech from Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, who told the audience that the US needed to be “aggressive” in its pursuit of Islamic State, that police officers have got “a bad rap” from sections of the media and that there needs to be a flat tax on all income levels. Carson patted a nearby bust of Thomas Jefferson, who he called a “genius”, during the speech. “We need to buy that debt down, we need to have fiscal policies that make sense, we need a balanced budget amendment,” Carson said. A spokesman for Alec said: “It has been a great year for Alec with nearly 500 new Alec member legislators and 43 new stakeholder groups joining in the robust exchange of ideas during calendar year 2015. “Alec member legislators are more professional, more involved and more engaged than the average state legislator, and companies that depart – as a result of strategic shifts or any other reason – will unfortunately be absent from the educational exchange undertaken at Alec meetings.”"
"The prime minister and cabinet members have come under fire for flying to the Paris climate change talks, rather than taking the more environmentally friendly Eurostar. BusinessGreen understands David Cameron and energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd flew the short trip to the opening day of the talks last Monday.  International development secretary Justine Greening and her team also took a flight for her short trip to the COP21 talks on Saturday According to Eurostar, a short haul return flight from Heathrow to Charles de Gaulle airport emits 122 kg of CO2 per person, which is the equivalent of charging 740 iPods. The carbon footprint of making the short haul flight is said to be 11 times more than the 10.9 kg CO2 emitted per Eurostar passenger travelling from St Pancras to the centre of Paris. Craig Bennett of Friends of the Earth accused ministers of hypocrisy over the decision to fly and the spate of recent green policy reversals. “It’s perfectly easy to understand that many people will find British ministers flying to a climate conference to be hypocritical,” he said. “But the hypocrisy that really matters is the hypocrisy we’ve seen in government climate and energy policy these last six months. “A government that claims to be concerned about household bills and yet cuts spending on insulation, a government that says local communities must be in charge when it comes to onshore wind but overrules them on fracking. A government that says renewables must get off the subsidy train, while putting new nuclear on a massive subsidy train that’s 35 years long.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said ministers attending the summit used “the most efficient and cost effective modes of transport available”.Whitehall sources defended ministers’ choice of travel arguing the Eurostar was not a practical option given the time pressures and multiple commitments they were facing. They also argued that all travel emissions had been offset by the UN Climate Change Secretariat. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it was ironic that Rudd had flown. “The secretary of state is going to be leading discussions on curbing emissions between now and 2020, and one wonders whether other ministers in her group are going to be commenting on the irony that she’s just created some extra emissions unnecessarily,” he said. “Decc officials would surely be able to furnish ministers with figures on the relative carbon footprints of different modes of travel – or maybe those documents have been lost in the Decc job cuts.” Rudd is however understood to have caught the train back to Paris this weekend for the high-level segment of the talks, which start today, while energy and climate change minister Lord Bourne told BusinessGreen he was a keen train traveller. “I always take the Eurostar,” he said. “The prime minister’s position, in fairness, is probably a bit different because he’d probably been in Malta and Turkey so flying back seemed quite sensible. “This time Amber Rudd came by train as did the Decc team. It’s quite a pleasant way of travelling.” The revelations come as the on-going row over the plans for new runway capacity in the UK took another twist, as a group of business leaders and unions wrote to the prime minister urging him to back controversial plans for a new runway at Heathrow. Earlier this year, the Airports’ commission came out in favour of a third runway it Heathrow, but widespread concerns remain about the impact on air quality and the potential implications for the UK’s carbon emissions."
"A surge in US exports of crude oil to Europe this year has been heralded as the beginning of an alarming rise in highly polluting tar sands imports by environmentalists. Strict laws prevent the US from exporting its own crude to Europe but it has been re-exporting Canadian crude to EU countries such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, since April 2014.  Figures released by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) last week show that in the first nine months of 2015, shipments to Europe increased by 73%, reaching 3.56m barrels of crude, compared to 2.06m in the year before until November. While the EIA provided no breakdown of the various types of crude, analysts told the Guardian that they almost certainly contained a high degree of tar sands oil. “Almost any crude that is being re-exported from the US would most likely be sourced from tar sands,” said Shelley Kath, an independent analyst for the National Resource Defence Council in the US. “It is a very solid assumption because that is the very large production area and it is precisely the type of crude that has trouble finding [other] markets.” Canada’s tar sands are the world’s second largest carbon reserve after Saudi Arabia and the ex-Nasa scientist James Hansen once said that their exploitation would mean “game over” for the climate. Some analysts cautioned that it is difficult to make judgments based on the US data, which does not distinguish between different sources or types of crude oil. “I think there have been some re-exports of Canadian crude but not large amounts,” said Sean Cronin from Argus global markets.   Last year, the NRDC estimated that tar sands imports to Europe could rise from 4,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 700,000 bpd without EU action.  The spike in crude imports now coincides with a decision by the European commission in October 2014 to abandon efforts to legislate against tar sands according to their greenhouse gas intensity, following intense lobbying pressure.  “This is the opening of the gates after the EU’s failure to tackle tar sands in real barrels of oil,” said Colin Roche, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe. “We just hope that they will not be flood gates.” A Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) report in June noted “growing interest” from Europe in crude manufactured from the country’s tar sands.  The paper said that the EU’s fuel quality directive would have “discriminated against Canadian oil sands crude” but that this was scrapped after objections from the Canadian government and industry. As a result, “exports of Canadian crude oil to Europe have begun to occur and expanded transportation infrastructure in Canada with proposed pipelines to the coast will lead to increased exports in the future,” the report said. More than two-thirds of Europe’s oil refineries have already been upgraded to process tar sands, according to a report by the petroleum refining consultancy, Mathpro. The study found that 71 of Europe’s 95 refineries can now refine heavy or reprocessed crude, in an indication that Europe’s industry is anticipating an imminent switch in fuel imports. One recent National Resources Defence Council analysis predicted that between 5.3% and 6.7% of Europe’s crude oil and transport fuels would come from North America by 2020. The figure was 30 times higher than the EU’s estimate, when it abandoned attempts to make oil companies account for their carbon emissions in their final blends.  Tar sands are natural bitumen deposits which produce 23% more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oils, due to their energy and water-intensive production process. This involves steam injection and strip mining, which can leave environmental scars ranging from clear-cut forests to toxic tailing ponds and destroyed farmland."
"The Paris climate talks have opened with a promise to the world: to secure a historic agreement between nations to bring the runaway train of global warming to a halt. The world’s forests play a key role in fulfilling this promise.  When we keep forests standing, we have an invaluable asset in our fight against climate change. As writer Sam Knight has already highlighted in the Guardian: “There are three trillion trees on Earth and they are perfectly made to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.” When they fall, we make the task of keeping within an ever-diminishing carbon budget harder. And their value to our environment, economy and society does not end there.  The good news is that the private sector – the biggest land user globally – is starting to recognise its role in keeping our forests standing.  Marc Bolland, CEO of retail giant Marks & Spencer, announced this month that his company, along with Unilever, would be sourcing agricultural commodities from jurisdictions and countries that take the lead on ending deforestation.  This is a welcome addition to the groundswell of commitments already being made by companies to eliminate deforestation. Prince Charles also called on more businesses to act, to ensure that goals to achieve zero-net deforestation become “the norm, rather than the exception”.  This year’s findings from CDP’s global forests programme, the largest investor-backed platform for companies to show how they are managing deforestation risks, reveal that seven in 10 businesses have a commitment to address forest loss. This suggests that this new norm may not be far off. When companies are looking under the hood of their business – the supply chain – they’re seeing clear risks and impacts from the production of commodities like timber, soy, beef and palm oil. Brazilian company Marfrig Global Foods for example has cited financial impacts following a 2009 Greenpeace campaign highlighting their role in cattle-linked deforestation in the Amazon.  But with the world still losing millions of hectares of forests each year, the real test is not how many businesses are recognising risks and promising to act, it is how these pledges are being enacted. CDP’s data suggests that supply chain implementation could be a real stumbling block.  Take one of the early steps of the procurement process: setting standards. On average over three-quarters of manufacturers and retailers say they have procurement standards for their sourcing of forest-risk commodities. But dig deeper and you’ll see there is often scant detail about what these standards look like. Many policies will for example simply state a preference for a certified commodity, where a choice exists, or encourage certain general types of behaviour, such as “following ethical standards”. This is usually in contrast to companies’ high profile commitments, which frequently offer timetables and specific targets. The challenge for companies is to translate the clear language in their commitments into clear requirements for buyers to take into the market place.  Furthermore, only five companies out of the 171 reporting to CDP explicitly mention that they train their procurement teams on what their policies imply for commodity sourcing. This is perhaps why half the companies with commitments to source certified soy are yet to get any into their supply chains.  Some companies are however showing that the challenge of supplier engagement doesn’t have to be the undoing of their zero-deforestation dreams. Indonesia’s Asia Pulp & Paper, a key supplier itself to many well-known consumer goods companies, admits to entering uncharted territory when it comes to putting its zero-deforestation policy into practice. Rather than dictate how its suppliers should be following new procurement standards, the company is seeking to involve them in the decision-making process. “They will be responsible for leading the development of an integrated sustainable forestry management plan,” says its director of sustainability, Aida Greenbury. “It’s no longer top-down, it’s bottom up.” The ongoing forest fires in Indonesia underscore the need for engaging every part of the supply chain. “We are a big company with significant resources,” says Greenbury. “but we are only one actor among many in the landscapes in which we operate. We need all actors in those landscapes to pull in the same direction if we are to achieve meaningful change.”"
"More than a dozen African countries have joined an “unprecedented” $1.6bn (£1bn) initiative to boost development and fight climate change by restoring 100m hectares (247m acres) of forest across the continent over the next 15 years. The African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative – known as AFR100 – was launched on Sunday at a Global Landscapes Forum meeting during the Paris climate change conference.   It will be underpinned by a $1bn investment from the World Bank in 14 African countries over the next 15 years and by $600m of private sector investment over the same period.  The initiative will also be supported by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (Nepad) and the World Resources Institute. To date, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Niger, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda have between them committed more than 42m hectares of land for forest landscape restoration, an area larger than Zimbabwe or Germany. Cameroon, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Congo-Brazzaville and Togo have also committed to forthcoming hectare targets as part of the AFR100. Participants point out that forests and trees contribute to African landscapes by reducing desertification and improving soil fertility, water resources and food security, as well as by increasing biodiversity and the capacity for climate change resilience and mitigation. They say the initiative will not only help to build on existing climate pledges made by African countries, but will also provide an engine for economic growth and development. “Restoring our landscapes brings prosperity, security and opportunity,” said Dr Vincent Biruta, Rwanda’s minister of natural resources.  “With forest landscape restoration we’ve seen agricultural yields rise and farmers in our rural communities diversify their livelihoods and improve their wellbeing.” The commitments made through AFR100 will build on the Bonn challenge – launched four years ago – which aims to revitalise 150m hectares of land by 2020, and the New York Declaration on Forests, which pushes the target up to 350m hectares by 2030. The new initiative is intended to capitalise on “a strong tradition” of successful forest landscape restoration in Africa: local communities in the Tigray region of Ethiopia have already restored more than 1m hectares, while in Niger, farmers have improved food security for 2.5 million people by increasing the number of on-farm trees across 5m hectares of agricultural land. Dr Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, the CEO of Nepad and former prime minister of Niger, said that countries such as Malawi, Ethiopia and Mali were already reaping the benefits of restoration, but added: “We need to scale up restoration across the whole continent - more than 700m hectares of land in Africa have potential for restoration.” Wanjira Mathai, chair of the Green Belt Movement and daughter of the Nobel peace prize laureate Wangari Maathai, said: “The scale of these new restoration commitments is unprecedented. “I have seen restoration in communities both large and small across Africa, but the promise of a continent-wide movement is truly inspiring. Restoring landscapes will empower and enrich rural communities while providing downstream benefits to those in cities. Everybody wins.”  Earlier this year, a UN report said that although the rate at which the world is losing its forests has been halved, an area of woodland the size of South Africa has still been lost since 1990. The wider consequences of deforestation were highlighted by France’s environment minister, Ségolène Royal in October, when she told a London summit that the loss of forests may have triggered the recent Ebola outbreak in west Africa. Royal said researchers believe the destruction of forest habitat brought bats, known to carry the virus, into greater contact with humans."
"Up to a quarter of the permafrost that lies underneath the surface of Alaska could melt by the end of the century, spewing long-held carbon into the atmosphere and helping accelerate climate change, US government scientists have predicted.  The US Geological Survey used satellite and on-ground data to estimate that 38% of mainland Alaska has permafrost, a band of soil, rock or sediment that is frozen underground for at least two consecutive years. In Fairbanks, Alaska, the soil has been frozen for several thousand years at just 30 to 40cm underground, with only the upper level of soil thawing every summer before freezing again in winter.   But this icy mass is now under threat from warming temperatures. Under scenarios calculated by USGS, 16% to 24% of Alaska’s permafrost will disappear by the end of the century under varying climate change outcomes. The declines are expected to be sharper in the heavily forested central areas of Alaska, rather than the state’s north. “Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost, which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes,” the USGS study states. “Taken together, these results have obvious implications for potential remobilization of frozen soil carbon pools under warmer temperatures.”  The melting of the permafrost would release carbon stored for many years underground, causing the sort of “feedback loop” that has concerned climate scientists: as warming temperatures melt ice in the Arctic region, carbon and methane that has been locked away for thousands of years is being released, thereby fueling more warming and melting.  The USGS has previously said that there would be a “gradual and prolonged” release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost but this is the first time the agency has quantified the loss.  There is an estimated 1.4bn to 1.85bn tonnes of organic carbon stored in the Arctic permafrost – around half of all such carbon stored in Earth’s soils. The air temperature in the Arctic has risen twice as fast as the rest of the world. It has gone up 0.6C in the past three decades alone, leading to a pronounced warming underground. Average temperatures in the permafrost have increased by 5.5C since the 1980s.  The level of Alaskan permafrost melting will depend on the severity of climate change and doesn’t factor in possible future disturbances such as wildfires. But it complicates the effort needed to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase on pre-industrial times. Greenhouse gas reductions promised by nations currently locked in climate talks in Paris would result in warming of at least 2.7C, a scenario that doesn’t factor in the consequences of feedback loops.  “A warming climate is affecting the Arctic in the most complex ways,” said Virginia Burkett, USGS associate director for climate and land use change.   “Understanding the current distribution of permafrost and estimating where it is likely to disappear are key factors in predicting the future responses of northern ecosystems to climate change.”"
"The UK government was warned by its official climate change advisers in October that it needed to take action on the increasing number of homes at high risk of flooding but rejected the advice.  The decision not to develop a strategy to address increase flooding risk came just a few weeks before Storm Desmond brought about severe flooding in Cumbria, Lancashire and other parts of the north west causing an estimated £500m of damage.  The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) also told the Guardian that, despite David Cameron’s promise to do so, the government had failed to learn lessons from the widespread flooding in the winter of 2013-14. Those floods led to emergency financial bailouts to flood defence funds which had previously been cut under the coalition government. The revelation came as George Osborne announced a £50m repair and renew scheme for Cumbria and Lancashire in the wake of the floods, promising that businesses and homeowners will quickly receive the help that they need. Osborne said the scheme would be administered by local authorities, acknowledging that a centrally administered fund following the floods in 2014 had been slow to get funds to families in need.  The region had to deal with more heavy rain on Wednesday, causing more disruption, although flooding on the scale of last weekend is not expected. Cumbria police said that more than a thousand homes are still without power. In June, the CCC’s statutory report on the UK’s progress on climate change highlighted dealing with floods from extreme weather as the government’s most serious failing in preparing for the impacts of global warming. It stated: “Plans and policies, or progress in addressing vulnerabilities, are lacking”. The CCC said “residual” flood risk – the flooding resulting from extreme weather events that cannot be prevented by normal flood defences – was increasing. On Monday, environment secretary Liz Truss said the Storm Desmond floods had resulted from “extreme weather conditions” and “unprecedented amount of rainfall.” The CCC recommended that the government should “develop a strategy to address the increasing number of homes in areas of high flood risk”. But in October the government replied: “We believe that a strategy to address future residual risk would not be appropriate at this time.” “The CCC made a very clear recommendation in its statutory advice, but the government rejected it,” said Daniel Johns, the CCC’s head of adaptation.  “The government approach is to build and protect, but this only provides a certain level of protection,” Johns told the Guardian. “Defences can’t be considered to remove the risk of flooding entirely.” He said that even in the best case scenario, with full flood defence funding, no building on flood plains and moderate climate change, the number of people in the high risk category for flooding will still increase by 45,000 by 2050 as global warming causes more extreme weather.  “But the government has no strategy to address this residual risk,” Johns said. Such a strategy would focus on reducing the impact of extreme floods by, for example, increasing protection on properties themselves and managing river catchments so rain runs off hills more slowly. Johns also said the government had failed to learn lessons from the 2013-14 floods. “After 2013-14, the wettest year in instrumental records, it is notable that there was no systematic review of lessons learned in the same way as there was after 2007”, when severe flooding lead to the extensive Pitt Review. In February 2014, prime minister Cameron visited the submerged Somerset Levels and said: “There are always lessons to be learned and I will make sure they are learned.” “David Cameron promised a full review of the future capability of UK’s flood defences back in 2014, but has never delivered on this,” said Guy Shrubsole, at Friends of the Earth.  “With the government’s inadequate climate change preparations leaving thousands more homes at high flood risk by 2050, ministers clearly need to do far more,” Shrubsole said. “The prime minister must get tough on flooding and tough on the causes of flooding – and that means tackling carbon emissions as well as investing more in flood defences.”  A government spokeswoman said: “This government has been clear on its commitment to climate change action and we are pushing for an ambitious global deal in Paris as well as driving innovation to build a low-carbon economy. We are also investing £2.3bn over the next six years to better protect 300,000 homes. The Environment Agency’s figures take account of climate change and show that this investment will reduce flood risk.”"

"An Africa-wide mega-scale initiative backed by all African heads of state should see the continent greatly increase its renewable energy over the next 15 years.  The African Renewable Energy Initiative (Arei) plans to develop at least 10 GW of new renewable energy generation capacity by 2020, and at least 300 GW by 2030, potentially making the continent the cleanest in the world.  The International Energy Agency, which has said that Africa is at the “epicentre of the global challenge to overcome energy poverty”, estimates that annual electricity consumption per capita in Africa for 2012 was around 600 kWh, compared with the world average of 3,064 kWh.  The plan to accelerate solar, hydro, wind and geothermal energy could see Africa leapfrogging other continents by developing thousands of small-scale “virtual power stations” that distribute electricity via mini-grids and would not require transmission lines, which involve a loss of up to a quarter of power during the process. The initiative, which is tentatively estimated to cost at least $500bn over 20 years, is billed as “by Africa, for Africa”, and is intended to reduce Africa’s present reliance on coal. As well as reducing emissions, it will help at least 600 million people switch from lighting homes and cooking with diesel, kerosene and wood, and reduce air pollution in homes and cities. Solar is expected to play a leading role. “We are ready to engage in massive solar and wind energy production to attain 100% electricity reach for our people,” said Judi Wakhungu, Kenya’s environment cabinet secretary. Speaking at the launch of the initiative at the COP 21 talks in Paris, the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, said the continent currently loses 4% of its GDP due to a lack of clean energy. “Africa is the continent suffering the most from the scorching heat from rising temperatures, and droughts have become more frequent and with greater intensity than ever before. Africa needs more money for adaptation.  “The continent has been short-changed by climate change. But we must ensure that it is not short-changed by climate finance. AfDB will triple its climate finance to $5bn a year by 2020,” he said. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where the number of people without access to electricity is set to rise. By 2030, Africa’s share of the world’s population without electricity will increase from less than half today to more than two-thirds. Detailed plans for each country will be worked out over the next five years, but the AfDB and other financial groups, including the World Bank, have pledged an initial $5bn. News of the initiative comes as a coalition of 12 countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia and Malawi set themselves a goal to replant 100m hectares (247m acres) of forest across the continent in the next 15 years. It follows the successful planting of millions of trees and bushes in parts of Tigray, Ethiopia, and elsewhere where droughts, overgrazing and deforestation have devastated and eroded landscapes. Where land has been replanted with trees and bushes, farming communities have seen rapid improvement in soils, water supplies and increased food security. "
"French authorities are enforcing “unprecedented restrictions on civil society” at the UN climate change talks in Paris, the author and activist Naomi Klein has said. Klein said the ongoing talks were a victim of austerity as the French government had failed to provide adequate state funding, leading to heavy sponsorship by corporations. Meanwhile authorities have imposed a ban on mass protests around COP21, as the conference is known, in the wake of last month’s terror attacks in Paris.  “We have got unprecedented restrictions on civil society – they’ve handed a megaphone to the corporations and taken the megaphone away from the social movements,” Klein said. “It’s a combination of the role of corporations inside the COP and the banning of protests outside. “We always knew that this was going to be the most corporate-sponsored COP, it’s a victim of austerity … You should at least be able to have a dialogue between the corporate solutions and the popular solutions, but only one side of the debate is being given a megaphone and the other side is being hauled out or banned.” Activists have found creative ways around the ban on mass gatherings, with 10,000 pairs of shoes laid out where a climate march should have started and a human chain running past the Bataclan concert venue where 90 people died. But police have arrested protesters who they suspect will flout the ban, and hundreds of anti-capitalist protesters were kettled by police last Sunday. On Friday police were seen carrying protesters from the opening of Solutions 21, an exhibition for businesses to showcase their proposals for tackling climate change, according to reports by New Internationalist and Climate Home Andrew Wilson, of the International Chamber of Commerce, said there had been “no real sense of isolation” for businesses inside the summit. “There is no sense that they are being given special treatment,” he said. World leaders opened the conference on Monday and negotiators are now trying to thrash out a new deal on limiting greenhouse gas emission post-2020 by the end of the week. In May it was announced that 20% of the £122m cost of the summit would be funded by companies including EDF, Air France, Renault-Nissan and Engie. Klein spoke to the Guardian on Saturday at Le Trianon theatre in Paris before a concert where Thom Yorke and Patti Smith played to “help raise consciousness” of the talks. "
"Negotiators paving the way for a global climate change agreement in Paris have cleared a major hurdle, producing a draft accord in record time and raising hopes that a full week of minister-led talks can now clinch a deal despite many sticking points. No part of the deal has been finalised because in the end it is likely to be a tradeoff between developing countries’ demands – particularly for financing to help cope with the impacts of locked-in climate change – and wealthier nations’ insistence that over time all countries properly account for the progress they have made towards emission reduction goals.  And it remains littered with brackets – indicating areas of disagreement. But the document handed to the French on Saturday has refined 50 pages down to just over 20 and, unusually, was agreed on schedule, leaving a full week for ministers to reach agreement. China’s chief climate negotiator, Su Wei, said: “It has laid a solid foundation for next week … like when we cook a meal you need to have all the seasonings and ingredients and recipes, but next week is the actual cooking.” Senior negotiators and long-time observers believe there will be a way through the sticking points. “There is good news. This is only a basis for a negotiation … there are several disagreements that we need to talk to each other, to try to solve … but political will is there from all parties,” he said. Non-government observers were also cautiously optimistic. Martin Kaiser of Greenpeace said progress was far better than at a similar point in the 2009 Copenhagen talks. “At this point in Copenhagen [in 2009] we were dealing with a 300-page text and a pervasive sense of despair. In Paris we’re down to a slim 21 pages and the atmosphere remains constructive. But that doesn’t guarantee a decent deal. Right now the oil-producing nations and the fossil fuel industry will be plotting how to crash these talks when ministers arrive next week.” Laurence Tubiana, the French envoy for the talks, said: “We could have been better, we could have been worse. The job is not done, we need to apply all intelligence, energy, willingness to compromise and all efforts to come to agreement. Nothing is decided until everything is decided.” Liz Gallagher, project manager at the non-profit organisation E3G, said the first week of talks had seen “some movement among negotiation blocs, with the idea of north and south … becoming more nuanced”. India had been “better behaved than we expected them to be”, she said, but Saudi Arabia had been blocking the negotiations on several fronts. The Saudis had, for example, been trying to prevent any reference to the need to hold global warming at 1.5C.  The final draft agreement includes the options of holding temperature increases to 1.5C or “well below two degrees”; evidence, the US envoy, Todd Stern, said on Friday, of the emergence of “a high-ambition coalition”, that “includes many countries” but not all of the 195 countries in the talks. For the foreign minister of the tiny Marshall Islands, Tony de Brum, that goal is a matter of survival because some islands are already under water. “Put simply, I refuse to go home from Paris without being able to look my grandchildren in the eye and say I have a good deal for you.” The Saudis have also been blocking the idea that the commitments countries have put on the table in Paris – covering emission reductions between 2020 and 2030 – should be reviewed before that period commences, and potentially increased. The Climate Action Tracker website has calculated those commitments put the world on track for warming of at least 2.7C. Differences on this issue between China and the US were central to the breakdown of the Copenhagen talks six years ago, but in Paris China is taking a softer approach. “We need to enhance the transparency system … it is very important to build trust,” Su said.  There is intense division over how the agreement is worded, in a way that would bind rich countries to specific continued investments, beyond the deal struck in Copenhagen for $100bn (£66bn) a year in public and private money to flow by 2020. (An OECD review said around $60bn was already committed, but poor countries dispute the calculations). And there are also divisions over suggestions big developing countries should join rich countries to make financial contributions to help poor countries reduce their emissions and cope with the impacts of locked-in climate change. Stern told reporters some countries had “over-read” the issue. He said it was about recognising what was already happening – China pledged US$3.1bn in support to developing countries, when President Xi Jinping met President Obama at the White House this year – rather than introducing any requirement, he said. A group of 10 Democratic US senators reassured countries at the climate meeting on Saturday they “had Barack Obama’s back” and would defend his agenda in a Republican-controlled Congress. The 10 were the first wave of what is anticipated to be a strong US presence at the Paris meeting, designed to counter Republican attempts to sink Obama’s climate plan. Congress voted last week to repeal the main part of Obama’s plan, especially on rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants. But the Democrats said they would be prepared to defend Obama’s agenda in Congress, and push for stronger climate action. “What you see here are people who are going to protect what the president is putting on the table here in Paris as a promise from the American people to the world,” Ed Markey, a Democrat senator from Massachusetts, told a press conference. “We are going to back up the president every step of the way.” Despite the multiple disagreements in Paris, Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN convention on climate change, said the talks were “where we thought they could be”. Officially Saturday is “high level action day” in Paris, the culmination of a process to get emission reduction commitments from bodies other than governments. There have been more than 10,000 such pledges from businesses, local authorities, non government groups and individuals. Among those attending the event are the former US vice president Al Gore, the former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the actor-cum-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the actor Sean Penn."
"Six years after an unnamed storm wreaked havoc across Cumbria, Storm Desmond struck the county with fearsome impact once again. Those who had their homes flooded or were forced to wade waist-deep to seek drier ground will not have had time to make immediate comparisons, nor consider deeply whether it is all down to climate change.  The Met Office and the Environment Agency were busy ensuring people were safe and prepared for more rain over the coming days . They said communities in the north of England and southern and central Scotland must remain vigilant.  Environmental campaigners suggested it was a sign of a bleak future for Britain and the rest of the world, accusing negotiators at the UN’s climate change conference in Paris of “fiddling while Britain floods”. Ground already saturated by rain could not cope with the downpour of Friday and Saturday. The Environment Agency’s rain gauge in Honister showed 341mm (13.4in) of rain fell in 24 hours from Friday evening at 6.30pm to the same time on Saturday.   The Met Office’s confirmed 48-hour figures between 9am on Friday morning to 9am on Sunday were more modest. Those for the weather station at Shap, Cumbria, showed 262.6mm of rain, while one in Keswick, also in Cumbria, recorded more than 178mm and at Blencathra it was nearly 175mm. But the weather service said the indications were that some parts of the county might have experienced 300mm of rainfall, well over the normal 200-250mm expected in the average December.  More bad weather is on its way to the same areas that suffered over the weekend – parts of Northern Ireland, north-west England, the Scottish borders and south and central Scotland. It is not likely to be the only rainfall in the UK, either on Monday or in subsequent days. The Met Office is concerned that rain, accompanied by more high winds, will bring more floods to add to the already swollen rivers and water courses. Madlen Burgessat the Met Office said: “It is not really possible to attribute one individual storm or event like we are having right now to climate change. It needs a bit more investigation. “The weather we are seeing is all due to a slow-moving frontal system and that is just bringing more prolonged spells or heavy rain and strong winds and that is not necessarily unusual for this time of year ... You are expecting unsettled weather,”she said. The Environment Agency said at least 8,600 homes had been protected over the weekend and even though water had come over the top of some flood defences , they had provided vital extra time for emergency services to evacuate homes. Asked specifically if the weekend’s chaos could be directly related to climate change, a spokesmanfor the agency said: “Climate change is happening now and we must build resilience and adapt to the changes that are unavoidable. Climate change adaptation has been going on- for some time: sea level rise has been factored into coastal decisions since 1998.” Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth climate campaigner,said: “As climate negotiators fiddle in Paris, Britain floods. Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall and floods in the UK and around the world. “Yet the UK government is failing to protect us by not investing enough in flood defences and cutting support for the clean energy needed to tackle climate change.” "

"Climate change hit the headlines again last week during the Paris climate summit. The speed at which we have burned fossil fuels and increased the proportion of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere is staggering. But we are far from the first to wreak climate havoc on our planet. A mind boggling 2800 million years ago photosynthesising bacteria began to flourish, using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food, and producing oxygen as waste. Their success rebalanced Earth’s atmosphere, increasing oxygen and reducing greenhouse gases. The result was one of Earth’s most severe ice ages – the Huronian glaciation – which lasted 300 million years.  Leaping forward to 470 million years ago, the first moss-like plants crept onto land. The acids they secreted dissolved the rocks they clung onto, and this weathering sucked carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, triggering yet another ice age and a mass extinction. Roll on to 375 million years ago, and the same thing happened again – this time when rooted plants marched onto land and increased rock weathering. Weathering of rocks can have ferocious climate consequences – it has tipped Earth into ice ages many times in the past, including the infamous “Snowball Earth” around 700 million years ago. So could rock weathering be our climate salvation today? According to a paper published last week in Nature Geoscience, landslides significantly accelerate weathering, because of the amount of fresh rock surface that they expose. But even so, we’d need a helluva lot of landslips to get us out of our current climate fix..."
"Record rain, flooded homes, evacuations, power cuts, Red Cross centres, mobilised soldiers and emergency Cobra committee meetings: this is what climate change looks like for the UK.  Flooding is the nation’s number one threat from global warming: five million homes are already at risk, and the number is rising as temperature rises.  Just as after the severe floods of the winter of 2013-14, David Cameron has pledged to do all he can to help the many thousands of people affected. But he is treating the symptoms, not the cause. Since Cameron became prime minister, the government has ignored one warning after another and overseen serious under-investment in flood defences. After taking office in 2010, annual funding for flood defences was slashed by 27%. When heavy summer flooding hit in 2012, I revealed that almost 300 planned flood defences had not been built due to the cuts.  Global warming means weather records are more likely to be broken and the wettest winter for 250 years in 2013-14 caused huge floods. At that point I revealed that flood-stricken communities, including those visited by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, had been left without planned defences following funding cuts. Undelivered defences also included schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Thames Valley also saw flooding, in a region where planned defences had been delayed and downsized. The current flooding across Cumbria includes places where new flood defences have actually been built, but the extraordinary downpour overwhelmed them. Nonetheless, the defences delayed the flooding, allowing vital time to prepare and evacuate those most at risk. More downpours are inevitable, so imagine the impact on places where defences have not been upgraded or funding for maintenance is not sufficient. The government has been warned many times. The Pitt Review after the 2007 floods concluded much more funding was needed. The surge in funding under Labour was halted by the coalition in 2010.  In 2012, the government’s own research showed increased flooding is the greatest threat posed by climate change in England. The government’s own climate change advisors then told ministers there was a £500m hole in their flood defence plans, even to just to keep pace with the rising risk driven by climate change. The shortfall would result in £3bn of damages, the Committee on Climate Change said. Adapting to climate change, principally flooding, is the responsibility of the environment department. But in May 2013, under then environment secretary Owen Paterson, the number of officials working on the national adaptation programme fell from 38 to six. In November 2014, a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the risk of flooding was indeed rising as a result of government funding cuts. Furthermore, half the nation’s flood defences had been left with “minimal” maintenance, according to the spending watchdog. The NAO also contradicted Cameron’s claim that his government was spending more than ever before on flood defences. Funding had fallen by 10% in real terms, said the NAO, when £270m of one-off emergency funding after the 2013-14 floods was excluded. Spending on maintenance had fallen by 6% in real terms in the five years of the coalition, the NAO said. Flood defences are big ticket items and hard to fund when the nation’s finances are tight. But not finding the money is a clear false economy. The NAO report said every £1 spent on flood defences prevented almost £10 in damage. It noted that Cameron’s £270m bail-out was poor substitute for sustained spending: “Ad-hoc emergency spending is less good value than sustained maintenance.” Cameron is set to visit Cumbria and will see the immediate devastation wrought by storm Desmond. What he won’t be around to see is the months and years of anguish caused by floods: precious belongings lost forever by sewage-tainted waters, months in temporary accommodation and feelings of panic at every future rainstorm rattling the windows. Cumbria’s floods struck at the halfway point of the crucial two-week UN climate summit in Paris. Cameron’s statement at its opening contrast starkly with his government’s long record of cuts and delays to flood defence spending. Cameron told his fellow world leaders: “What I’m saying is that instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.”  For the UK, today’s action means fighting floods and there was a suggestion from Cameron during Monday’s visit to Cumbria that this is finally sinking in. “After every flood the thing to do is to do is sit down, look at the money you are spending, look at what you are building, look at what you are planning to do in the future, and ask is it enough. That’s exactly what we will do,” he said."

"In the industrial northern suburbs of Paris, 195 countries are locked in talks to reduce national climate emissions. They sweat it out 24/7 in anonymous, hangar-sized buildings, protecting their interests, giving away as little as possible – exhausted by the 20-year struggle to make even marginal cuts. Meanwhile in Paris’s palatial Hôtel de Ville, 450 mayors from around the world have been listening to movie stars like Leonardo di Caprio and Robert Redford. The mayors are confident, quaff the best wine and congratulate themselves on committing their cities to doing far more to combat climate change than any central governments could ever hope. The contrast between local and national politicians in Paris for the UN Climate Change Conference has been stark. What it shows is that much of the power to reduce climate emissions lies now with cities, not national governments. In the last few weeks, dozens of cities have lined up to announce targets that far surpass anything that countries can hope to do. Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh and 45 other British cities have just signed a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2050 – but they are far outshone by Copenhagen, which will do so in 10 years, Vancouver by 2030, Adelaide, Stockholm and a host of others in China, Europe and elsewhere which will be zero carbon within 20 years.  Paris, shocked by recent heatwaves and its air pollution, is to double its network of bike lanes to 870 miles, create 10,000 secure bike parking spaces, and offer financial incentives for those buying electric and conventional bikes. It and 21 other cities also pledged last week to spend 10% of their annual budgets on “resilience-building goals”, without raising additional taxes. Seattle leads the US with a pledge to go carbon neutral by 2050, and more than a dozen other major metropolitan areas have pledged an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. In China, driven by the need to reduce air pollution, Beijing – which today issued its first ever pollution “red alert” – and 10 other Chinese cities have agreed to peak greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2020, a decade ahead of the existing target for the world’s biggest emitter. Mayors are closer to people than governments. Mayors are really the force we should work with In total, more than 450 cities with a combined population of nearly 1bn people have now pledged to reduce emissions by more than 50% in around 15 years by encouraging walking and cycling, reducing emissions from landfill, switching to renewables, and making people to change the way they travel. “Mayors are a powerful group. You are the catalysts. Be bold, be courageous – the world is watching you,” Di Caprio told the mayors on Friday. He was echoed by Robert Redford: “Mayors are closer to people than governments. They are less political. Politics gets in the way of things. Mayors are really the force we should work with.”  According to Mark Watts, director of the C40 group of 83 large cities addressing climate change: “The national state is the same late-18th-century model designed to defend its borders, not to solve problems. But the job of the mayor demands action. These days, people in all the world’s big cities people want much the same: clean air, public transport and cycles and not cars. There is no debate any more about there being a choice between economic growth or climate change action. Mayors have to use their powers to the maximum.” Necessity is the reason cities trump countries on climate change, says Karl Pope, environment adviser to former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, now the UN’s special envoy on cities. “Cities are where emissions are. They are mostly consumers of fossil fuels so they would like to use them as little as possible; they have a natural instinct to save on fossil fuels. Also they are not very ideological. Improving quality of life is seen as a good.” Pope identifies three groups who will lead others on climate: “Cities in Nordic countries that with will be meticulous about everything. Then there are a few in Latin America and Africa which will be unbelievably creative. A third group is in East Asia and China which will do things on a massive scale.” In Europe, Rotterdam is planning floating forests and housing estates, but Copenhagen is widely seen as the world’s greenest capital. “We expect to invest 1.5bn euros over the next few years to adapt to climate change – but we see this an an investment which will pay itself back in jobs and good business,” says Copenhagen’s mayor, Frank Jensen. “We should not be afraid of making cities greener,” he says. “Copenhagen shows it is good business and the investments pay themselves off . Mayors have to act because cities are affected by climate change, too. We cannot wait for the heads of state – citizens expect mayors to do something.” Air pollution and health is driving cities in China and India to reduce emissions. Reducing the use of diesel or petrol in Delhi or Beijing not only greatly reduces climate emissions, it reduces respiratory and lung diseases, heart attacks and cancers. “There’s nothing like death to focus the mind,” says Pope. But the scale and speed with which some Chinese cities are switching from fossil fuels is shocking, he says. Shenzu, Wuhan and others are, for example, in the process of replacing their large diesel bus fleets with thousands of all-electric buses. “We’re going to build a recyclable society for our future generations. We want mounds of gold and silver as well as green water and mountains,” said Liu Ziqing, party secretary of Caidian District, Wuhan. Economists now calculate that if cities invested in bikes, walking, more efficient transport, efficient buildings and waste management, this low-carbon future could save them $17trillion a year. According to New Climate Economy (NCE), a group set up examine the costs and benefits of addressing climate change, the savings would come from stimulating economic activity, decreasing healthcare costs, reducing poverty, and cutting the costs associated with urban sprawl, such as time and productivity lost to traffic congestion. “For too long, there’s been the same old argument used to prevent bold action on climate change, which is there’s some sort of trade-off between economic prosperity and climate action,” says Nick Godfrey, an author of the report for NCE. “In cities, that is a false choice. Actually, there is a significant confluence between promoting economic growth and prosperity, and climate action.” “Please do more. Please commit today,” Di Caprio told the purring mayors in Paris. “The shift does not need technical breakthroughs. Only strong leadership.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion"
"Green campaigners should stop talking about the risks from climate change in 2050 and talk about “right now”, the former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has said. “It drives me crazy when people talk about 30 years from now, rising sea levels and so on,” he told the Guardian in an interview at the Paris COP21 climate conference. “What about right now? Thousands of people are dying from pollution. People are living with cancer [because of air pollution].” He said campaigners should focus on the immediate effects of polluting the environment, because that resonates with the public in a way that distant visions of future harms do not. Most people find it hard to imagine the world in 2050 or 2100, the dates that are being discussed at the Paris conference for a “long-term goal” on climate action, he said. “There are people stuck in cancer wards now, tubes sticking out of them - 7 million people die a year because of pollution,” he said. “We should be talking about that.” “Stuff that happens in the future does not mean anything to people,” he said. He cited an advertising campaign in California that showed small children sucking air through an inhaler, because of the damage done to their respiratory systems by breathing polluted air. “People saw this commercial, what we are doing to our kids, and thought ‘we have to protect our environment’.” Polls found that the ads were effective in persuading people of the need for new regulations, he said. “All of a sudden, the poll numbers changed.” “My job is to get the message out there,” he added. “If you do not have people behind you, you can’t do anything [on legislation]. Global warming is an extremely important issue, the most important issue. You have to communicate it properly. You have to communicate to people that this is right now.” At the Paris climate change conference, entering its second and final week, governments are hoping to forge a new global agreement on limiting emissions that would kick in from 2020, when current commitments run out. A new draft text of an agreement was published on Saturday, and is now under scrutiny by the 195 governments gathered in France. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and internationally known as a star in films such as Terminator, was a strong proponent of action on air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while in office. His successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, joined him in Paris in calling for action on emissions. “The Paris conference is the biggest leap forward in dealing with climate change. France has been instrumental in advancing this agenda,” he told the Guardian. Schwarzenegger said such joint efforts from both sides of the US political divide were essential to making progress on environmental problems. “I never paid much attention to [political] parties,” he said. “This is a people’s issue, not a party issue.” He said that “sub-national” authorities, such as state governors and assemblies in the US, and regional and city governments, could play an important role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, by taking their own initiatives independently of national governments. “It is good that this is now being recognised,” he said. “It’s about [emphasising] efficiency, and alternatives [to fossil fuels].” California under successive administrations has brought forward a series of measures on air pollution and greenhouse gases, including a pioneering regional cap-and-trade system for carbon. Republicans in the Senate recently opposed Barack Obama’s “historic” Clean Power Plan to cut nationwide emissions from power plants, and Republican states have filed lawsuits against the regulations. In Paris, a group of Republican politicians from the US has been seeking meetings with the chief officials of leading developed and developing nations. They broadly oppose an international deal on climate change, while the Obama administration has pushed strongly for an ambitious deal in Paris. A group of 10 Democratic senators also attended the talks at the weekend, pledging to help President Obama attain his environmental goals."
"A new £352bn coalition of investors including large insurer Aviva and major public and private funds in the UK, Norway and France has been launched to put pressure on some of the world’s biggest corporations to clean up their electricity sources. Aviva Investors – the £267bn arm of one of the UK’s biggest insurers – is one of 20 founding members of the initiative, which launches on Wednesday in Paris as negotiators at UN climate talks work against the clock to thrash out a new deal on limiting greenhouse gas emissions.   Other members include the French public sector fund ERAFP, Norway’s largest private pension fund KLP and Strathclyde pension fund, one of the UK’s largest public pension funds. The investors will call on the biggest companies on the stock exchange to switch to using 100% renewable electricity, by making a public pledge to join the RE100 campaign, which works to increase corporate demand for clean energy. Businesses joining set their own targets for transitioning to 100% renewable electricity. Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors, said that the campaign “has the potential to be an important component of managing carbon impact and delivering a business model in line with 2C.” On Monday, Coca-Cola, the BMW Group as well as the publishing and educational multinational Pearson joined the 50 strong group of companies who have already made the commitment. Others include Google, Nike, Starbucks, Microsoft and Adobe. Catherine Howarth, chief executive at ShareAction, the responsible investment charity that brought together the investors to form the coalition, told the Guardian: “I think it’s going to hugely accelerate the pace at which big corporates around the world commit to transitioning their businesses to using renewable energy for electricity. When shareholders – particularly when working collectively – get right behind something that also makes good business sense it really accelerates the pace at which businesses’ boards look seriously and move on something.” The launch of the investor initiative follows the announcement last week that more than 500 institutions worldwide worth $3.7tn have now committed to move their investments out of fossil fuels. Meanwhile as negotiators and national ministers try to thrash out a deal in conference centre in the Le Bourget suburb of northern Paris, hundreds of mayors from around the world have been meeting to set independent targets to decarbonise their cities.  Howarth, who is also on the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, said: “There has been a huge energy created through the [UN climate talks] process and a wonderful dynamic created where all over the world people are making commitments to transition, whether it’s in the investment community, the corporate community or in cities. This drumbeat of positive announcements will help to create the conditions in which the negotiators on the inside at Le Bourget are hopefully feeling that positive energy to bring us closer to a deal.”"
"China, Brazil and South Africa have joined India in rejecting a key OECD study stating that rich countries have already mobilised nearly two-thirds of the $100bn (£67bn) pledged to secure a new climate deal.  The refusal by the world’s four most powerful developing countries to accept the methodology used by western economists, to calculate the money raised for poor countries to adapt to climate change, suggests that finance will be the major hurdle at the end of the talks on Friday.  The OECD study claimed that rich countries had already mobilised $57bn of climate aid in 2013-14, as pledged in 2009. But Indian government economists have claimed that the OECD study counted loans made to developing countries and double-counted aid money, putting the real figure closer to $2bn. “We welcome the OECD study but we do not recognise the numbers. There are double-counting issues,” said Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate change envoy.  South Africa said that the OECD figures, which have become the rich countries’ negotiating stance, should have been calculated in consultation with developing countries. “The reality is that parties here were not part of pulling together. Double accounting can not be accounted for. They should clearly say what they have provided, to whom and what is being counted,”said Izabella Teixeria, Brazil’s environment minister.  But the EU and 79 small African, Caribbean and Pacific countries joined forces on Wednesday to call for more ambitious deal. The move, which was expected, follows Germany increasing its funding for developing countries by $50m and other rich countries last week providing $250m for a climate fund for developing countries. The G7, the EU and Sweden also pledged €10bn for promoting renewables in Africa. The move which aligns some of the most vulnerable countries with the EU, splits the G77 group of 132 negotiating countries. According to the French presidency, progress is being made to reach a deal by the weekend, but negotiators say that there has been no agreement on any of the main issues. The four Basic countries, which are working together, have refused to state whether they want a long term goal of 2C or 1.5C. China and India are thought to want 2C, Brazil “under 2C”, and South Africa “in the region of 2C.” “We are discussing the matter. We will come up with a joint position,” said Teixeria. In a separate development, the Pope is expected to lend his powerful moral authority on behalf of countries most vulnerable to climate change, by supporting a new international goal to limit warming to under 2C. Leaders of low-lying states and other countries most at risk by climate change said on Tuesday they had received very positive responses from the Vatican, and expected the Pope to formally endorse their cause. “There are cardinals and several bishops very receptive to the 1.5C goal,” Emmanuel de Guzman, the Philippines climate change commissioner and leader of the bloc of climate vulnerable countries told a press briefing. “Hopefully we will hear something from the Pope this week. They are convinced that 1.5C goal is promoting human rights,” he said. “It is essentially about survival.” Since the start of the Paris meeting, there has been steady momentum towards adoption of a 1.5C goal which would improve the chances for low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and the Philippines to avoid dangerous climate change. The US, Canada and the EU have moved on side but the Pope would be the most powerful ally yet. The pontiff’s intervention on behalf of the poor and others most threatened by global warming in last June’s encyclical has electrified the climate movement. Campaigners say support from the Pope has been critical in reframing climate change as a matter of human rights and justice – rather than a narrow scientific issue."
"We are reaching le pointy end of the Paris climate change negotiations and a freshly prepared draft for a new global deal has just been released. With less than 72 hours of scheduled negotiating time left, this is officially squeaky-bum time for the 40,000 or so negotiators, delegates, observers, civil society groups, campaigners, activists and media filling the vast plywood and plastic regaled halls and corridors of the cavernous Le Bourget venue.  One of the key decisions at the talks will centre on what’s known as the “long term goal”.  Just what global temperature target will the Paris agreement aim for and how will the deal articulate what that means for our fossil fuel-heavy energy systems? More than 100 countries being led by nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have said that they need the agreement to set a pathway for the world to keep global warming below 1.5C – a full half a degree below the 2C guardrail that countries have previously signed up to. Emmanuel M. de Guzman, secretary of the Philippines Government’s Climate Change Commission, chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum – a group that has garnered support from more than 100 countries for a 1.5C target. He said: We have now breached 1 degree of global warming, and we only have half a degree left to control it, so we need to act with greater resolve and urgency. Paris is our chance, our hope. And we know it can be done as the science informs us. 1.5C of warming will already be close to catastrophic for our countries, but we know it’s the best we can achieve if we all act decisively.  A 2 degrees threshold has no validity anymore as a guardrail. We know that warming is already dangerous and we have to keep it to a minimum. The feasible minimum is 1.5C. Countries like the Phillipines, Ghana, Bangladesh and many poorer nations see the Paris talks as a literal make or break point for their future development. Analysts agree that the pledges already made by more than 170 countries will likely only cut global warming to about 2.7C.  But negotiators who want to see a deal go through are pushing for a five-yearly review mechanism along with a set of rules known as the “ratchet mechanism” that would mean countries have to continually improve with each review. No backsliding. But the other side of this coin is the impact that the deal will have on the world’s energy industries. It’s squeaky bum time too for fossil fuels. Here in Paris, the World Coal Association says it has been having “productive discussions with a range of governments and international organisations” in an attempt to save its industry’s future.  The industry group is trying to persuade the world that fossil fuels have a future in a decarbonized world. The industry is the biggest single contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and is telling negotiators it can capture those gases from coal burning on a large scale – a promise the industry has been making for a decade or so with no result.  At last year’s major climate talks in Lima, it emerged that a series of options had been inserted into the text of the agreement that essentially called for an end to the use of fossil fuels by the middle of this century. Some of those statements have survived until now and remain in the draft text just released. They are there in Article 3 of the text (article 2 refers to the global temperature goal with various choices on the table). Square brackets mean the statement is still not agreed – and there are lots of them!  {Collective long-term goal} 1. Option 1: Parties collectively aim to reach the global temperature goal referred to in Article 2 through [a peaking of global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking requires deeper cuts of emissions of developed countries and will be longer for developing countries; rapid reductions thereafter to [40–70 per cent][70–95 per cent] below 2010 levels by 2050; toward achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions [by the end][after the middle] of the century] informed by best available science, on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. Option 2: Parties collectively aim to reach the global temperature goal referred to in Article 2 through a longterm global low emissions [transformation toward [climate neutrality][decarbonization]] over the course of this century informed by best available science, on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. Alden Meyer, strategy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, has been to all the major climate talks (except one held in Marrakesh) since 1995. He says any Paris deal that doesn’t clearly state an ambitious temperature goal and also what that means for our energy future would “not be worth the price of the paper”. He said his group was pushing hard for a “clear qualitative signal” that explained the need to “ultimately squeeze all the greenhouse gas emissions out of the global economy, at least on a net basis”.  That’s just what the science says. Otherwise you are not going to get to where you need to get to stay below 2C and hopefully head back down to 1.5C. Meyer says the Paris deal needs to send a clear signal to global industry that investments can move away from high-emitting industries and accelerate a trend that’s already on the march. That will affect their decisions on trillions of dollars of asset investment. If they think that governments are serious about going where the science says we need to go, then they will respond in kind. If they think that governments are wishy-washy, and are wobbling or uncertain, then they will hedge their bets. A key question however is that even if a goal to limit global warming does shoot for 1.5C or well below 2C, is it actually possible to get there.  The UN Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report earlier this year set out a suite of scenarios.  The analysis found that to have a 50 per cent chance of keeping global warming below 1.5C, global greenhouse gas emissions would have to fall from an expected 56 billion tonnes of CO2e in 2020 to just eight by 2050. By the end of the century, emissions need to have fallen to below zero.  For a 2C target, the numbers are only marginally less challenging. To have a two in three chance of keeping global warming to below 2C by 2100, emissions would need to fall to just 23 billion tonnes by mid-century and reach negative territory by the end of the century. Dr Michiel Schaeffer is a biophysicist at Wageningen University and Research Centre and a founder of the respected Climate Analytics group that contributed to the UNEP report.  If you look at a long-term transformation pathway, then you have to phase out coal. From a scientific standpoint we don’t need to mess around with language (in Paris) to find something that’s acceptable here. From the work we did with the UNEP Emissions Gap Report it is absolutely clear. It needs to be zero global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by 2060 to 2080 for 1.5C or by 2080 to 2090 for 2C… that’s very simple. But I don’t think we’ll get it. I think there will be a compromise.  There are still many curly issues for the negotiators to deal with. How often will countries revise their actions? Will the ratchet mechanism be strong and transparent? What details will poorer countries with less capacity be expected to report?  But the goal is to protect the world from the impacts of climate change by rapidly cutting greenhouse emissions.  For that, there’s little room for compromise, fluffy language or fossil fuels."

"In the climate talks “blue zone”, in the Parisian district of Le Bourget, are the governments, their advisers and lawyers, big business and the financiers. Facebook has a stall, along with UN agencies and scientific bodies. But the world’s 4 billion small farmers, fishermen and women, indigenous peoples, hunters and gatherers, rural workers, pastoralists, and young people on the frontline of climate change, inhabit the “green zone”, beyond the fence where the decision-makers do not go.  Many of those in the green zone say they are excluded, and feel hurt that they have no seat at the table. The more powerful, richer voices are able to drown out their ideas and even set back their causes at the Paris talks.  “Right now, the talks are a failure. Our voices are not being heard,” said Jorge Furagaro Kuetgaje, climate coordinator for Coica, the Indigenous People of the Amazon Basin. Furagaro Kuetgaje and a colleague travelled for 10 days to get to Paris, to press for one sentence about indigenous rights to be included in the final text. This week it was expunged by negotiators, reportedly by a bloc of countries led by the US, UK and Norway, which had previously supported them. “We think that mining and oil companies that are on our territory or that want to be there, they have more power in the negotiations,” Furagaro Kuetgaje said. “So our voice is not heard. Yet we indigenous peoples live in the forests, and we protect nature and biodiversity and reduce climate change. “For us to continue to conserve the tropical forests … we need to have strong rights to those forests. Death should not be the price we pay for playing our part in preventing the emissions that fuel climate change.” A Global Witness report found that at least 116 environmental activists were murdered in 2014, and 40% of the victims were indigenous. Around 500 Amazonian Indians, Sami people from the Arctic, Dayaks from Indonesian rainforests devastated by mining, Sioux Indians fighting oil sands development in the Canadian province of Alberta, and Marshall Islanders whose homes and hospitals are inundated by rising water, say they are disappointed that their voices have not been heard.  But since last Friday, when news reached the many groups that all reference to indigenous peoples had been removed, the mood has darkened further, and the sense of betrayal is palpable.  “We came here with solutions. We do not understand why people make decisions for us in this way. Now the Colombian government has signed an agreement with Britain and Germany to avoid deforestation in the Amazon. But no one asked us. We were not consulted. We will lose our autonomy,” said Furagaro Kuetgaje. Equally disappointed in the way the negotiations are going are representatives of farmers’ organisations and agro-ecologists, who say the agenda in the talks has been to promote the interests of agribusiness.  Via Campesina, an international umbrella organisation of farmers’ groups, has brought people from 30 countries to press the point that smallholder farmers, who are estimated to produce 70% of the world’s food grown for humans, can prevent climate change more effectively than industrial farms can. Like indigenous leaders, they feel betrayed by the process and fear that the hidden agenda in Paris is to introduce more intensive farming, which will throw smallholders off the land and encourage agribusiness to “grab” African and Asian rural areas to grow biofuels, palm oil and animal feed. “While our leaders openly welcome multinational companies and their false solutions, we must urgently change the direction where agriculture is headed, to achieve a real positive approach for the climate. Given this, peasant agriculture and agro-ecology are considered economical, favouring both the environment and peasants,” said a spokesman for Via Campesina. “The real solutions to stop greenhouse gas emissions coming from agriculture and the food system are peasant agriculture and agro-ecology.”  They were backed this week by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the only UN organisation with a remit to work exclusively with small farmers. “If we are going to sustainably improve the livelihoods of the developing world’s smallholder farmers in the context of a changing climate, we need to ensure that their priorities are understood and reflected in policies,” said Ifad’s vice-president, Michel Mordasini.  Ifad’s report, The Policy Advantage, says smallholder farmers “know best the realities they face … and if they are not adequately involved in processes to formulate policy responses, they risk losing out and being sidelined in decisions that directly determine their ability to cope and adapt”. "
" A group of high-profile business leaders has challenged governments to set strong targets and not slam the door on limiting warming to 1.5C. On Monday, a Paris meeting aimed at reaching a global deal to fight climate change kicks up to a gear, with government ministers taking charge of negotiations.  As ministers arrived in Paris, the chief executives of companies such as Virgin, Marks & Spencer, L’Oreal and Unilever said it was critical for governments to reach for stronger targets that would free the world’s economy from carbon emissions by 2050 and avoid dangerous warming. The corporate leaders, members and supporters of the B Team, a coalition of chief executives for climate action, said governments should aim for a stronger target than the agreed goal of 2C and aim for actions that would eventually limit warming to 1.5C. The support for a 1.5C goal puts some of the world’s most powerful corporate leaders in sync with small islands and poor countries that are most vulnerable to climate change – as well as campaign groups which have been pressing rich countries to up their ambition. “We believe that net zero by 2050 would at least get us to 2 degrees, leaving the door open for further reduction to 1.5, which should be something we should be looking at in the future,” said Jochen Zeitz, the former chief executive of Puma and founder with Richard Branson of the B Team. “We believe the business case for net zero in 2050 is irrefutable,” Zeitz told a seminar on Sunday. Branson, a long-time supporter of action on climate change, said companies were looking to the talks to provide a clear signal – and would be able to get to carbon neutrality by mid-century. “We just need governments to set some rules,” he said. “Carbon neutral by 2050, we will have 35 years to get there. It’s actually just not that big a deal, but we need clear long-term goals set by governments this week. Give us that goal and we will make it happen.” The 1.5C goal is seen as a matter of life and death for some of the world’s poorest countries, and has been a key issue in climate negotiations. Vulnerable countries argue that the 2C goal backed by the US, China and Europe would seal the fate of hundreds of millions of people in low-lying countries like Bangladesh and the Philippines. The business leaders said they were framing their demand on governments in terms of emissions reductions, with a goal of net zero by 2050, because those were targets companies could set for themselves. Privately, however, some of the leaders said they were concerned about the politics of coming out explicitly for 1.5C now, instead of 2C. But they acknowledged that was indeed their goal. “Yes, we are for 1.5 degrees,” Mo Ibrahim, the founder of Celtel International, one of Africa’s leading mobile phone companies, told the seminar. The companies which signed on to the B Team argue that their support for a strong emissions reductions goal helps to keep pressure on governments to reach for a strong deal. The corporate leaders suggested their support for a strong agreement provides an important counterweight to the fossil fuel industry, especially in the US, which has blocked action on climate change. But they said they believed that the economy had reached a tipping point in terms of moving towards greener sources of energy. The French hosts of the climate talks on Sunday said they had recruited a team of ministers and officials from 14 countries to help put together a deal. The leaders immediately convened a series of small working groups that will meet to home in on elements of a deal. Negotiators said they felt reasonably optimistic for a strong outcome at the Paris meeting. In contrast to previous climate meetings – which deadlocked early – officials managed to pare down a draft text on schedule, leaving a full week for ministers to reach agreement.  Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and now head of the Foundation for Climate Justice, said she believed the draft released on Saturday had kept prospects alive for a 1.5C goal. “We have a commitment to stay below 2 degrees and keep open the prospect of 1.5C,” Robinson said. “Keeping that window of 1.5, which I think will happen in this agreement, is extremely important.” The prospects for achieving that goal are extremely daunting. Scientists estimate the world has already warmed by 1C since the industrial revolution. More than 100 of the 196 countries at the Paris meeting want a 1.5C goal. But until recently the 1.5C goal was dismissed as a pipe dream by rich countries and the bigger developing countries. Now, however, there is greater recognition of 1.5C as a threshold for dangerous climate change. With current warming of 1C, low-lying states in Africa and Asia and island countries were already exposed to extreme storms and weather phenomena such as this year’s strong El Nino. Last week, a group of countries most at risk broke away from the big developing country bloc and signed a declaration urging a 1.5C target."
"When Oslo revealed plans to ban all private vehicles from the centre by 2019, it joined a lengthening list of cities seeking to shift the focus away from cars and towards greener, citizen-focused mobility solutions. Around 7 million people globally are estimated to die from air pollution every year, not to mention the millions more killed in accidents involving motor vehicles.  In response, cities around the world are trying out car-free initiatives. Helsinki has ambitious plans to make its “mobility on demand” service so good that nobody will want to drive a car in the centre by 2025, while Paris’s car-free days have successfully reduced high pollution. New cities – such as the Great City on the outskirts of Chengdu, China, and Masdar near Abu Dhabi – plan to focus on mass transit or electric cars as alternatives to gas-guzzling private cars. But will cars in cities ever be consigned to the history books? The Norwegian capital’s announcement came last month as part of a wider political initiative by the newly elected leftist municipal government to halve the city’s emissions by 2020. On top of implementing a no-car zone within the city’s central ring road, Oslo plans a number of other proposals, including building at least 40 miles of new bike lanes, introducing rush-hour charges (on top of existing congestion fees) and removing parking spaces. These initiatives, coupled with the city’s move to divest fossil fuels from pension funds, are all in an effort to slash emissions. The city also plans to be fossil-fuel free by 2050. It’s certainly no secret that removing gas-guzzling vehicles will work wonders. When smog levels were at a dangerous high in Paris earlier in the year, mayor Anne Hidalgo gave the red light to half of the city’s diesel vehicles. After just 24 hours, PM10 particle pollution fell back to well below 80mg per cubic metre and traffic jams were reduced by almost 40%. Paris's mayor Anne Hidalgo has vowed to permanently ban all diesel-powered vehicles from the centre ​by 2020 France tops the European list for the highest percentage of diesel cars on the roads, thanks to government subsidies making the fuel cheaper than petrol. So, in December last year, Hidalgo vowed to implement a permanent ban on diesel-powered vehicles from the heart of the city by 2020. In tandem with this initiative, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure will be greatly improved, beginning with an €8m (£5m) walkable transformation of the River Seine’s right bank, and the doubling the cycling network to 870 miles. Before this radical initiative comes into play, Parisians were offered a brief taste of what their city might look like in 2020 when Hidalgo rolled out a car-free day across one-third of the French capital in sunny September. Air and noise pollution was significantly reduced, and major arteries such as the Champs Élysées transformed into temporary public spaces for bikes, pedestrians and impromptu yoga sessions. Hidalgo has also confirmed plans to implement emergency traffic bans during periods of high air pollution. Venice is often cited as the largest car-free city, but they have it easy, with canals and rivers instead of streets. Hamburg, on the other hand, is currently making waves by enforcing an auto-ban on a number of urban roads to develop a network of route for pedestrians and bikes that link parks and open spaces together. This “green network” will span 40% of the metropolis, transforming Germany’s second largest city into a more human-friendly environment, while also playing a role in absorbing CO2 and bringing the city closer to its goal of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Madrid, too, is focusing on the city at a human level, and recently hatched a plan to pedestrianise the urban core and expel cars by 2020. Beginning in early 2015, the Spanish capital introduced a limit on non-residential vehicles from entering a 1.36 sq mile area of the centre, expanding on an already existing zone. To strike a balance for the city’s residents, Madrid will be enlarging its bus network and building new pedestrian infrastructure, and it has already launched Europe’s first fully electric e-bike scheme. To top this off, the city recently announced plans similar to those in Paris, to ban 50% of cars when air quality levels were breached – free public transit will be provided on those days. Madrid is expanding its bus network and has launched Europe’s first fully electric bike share Dublin and Brussels are also toying with the idea of kicking the habit through city centre diesel-car bans, with similar ideas proposed by Liberal Democrats in London following the VW emissions scandal. Milan is offering public transit tokens to residents for every weekday they surrender their cars, and Rome is slowly progressing with parking bans. But there’s one European city that’s opting for an ambitious approach to render car ownership completely pointless. Forget closing off streets to cars; Helsinki is going all out on a plan to provide its citizens “mobility on demand” by 2025, by fusing together access to carpools, buses, taxis, bikes and ferries through one smartphone app. The software would function both as a payment platform and journey planner, equipping residents with an advanced array of cheap and convenient travel options that, as Adam Greenfield reported, “would be so good that nobody would have any reason to own a car”. And then there’s bike-friendly Copenhagen. Unsurprisingly, large swathes of the Danish capital have been closed to vehicles for decades, with bicycle infrastructure reaching into every corner. Pushing to become carbon neutral by 2025, Copenhagen will continue to prioritise bikes over cars through a series of 26 suburban commuter arteries known as “cycling superhighways”. However, car ownership in the city is currently on the rise, and Copenhagen’s lord mayor, Frank Jensen, is increasing the number of parking spaces, much to the discontent of some vocal residents. “I don’t want to say to Copenhageners that ‘I don’t like your lifestyle because you’re buying a car’,” says Jensen. “Our ambition is to have one third of trips made by bike, one third by transit and one third by car. We are investing in a new metro system … and we’re improving the seamless transition between the three modes in order to reach that goal.” Paris, Helsinki and now Oslo – European car-free efforts have really held the limelight in recent years. But in Latin America, there’s one city that’s been championing the idea of car-free streets since 1974. And that’s Bogotá. Every week in the Colombian capital, over 75 miles of urban roads are shut to vehicles. The routine event – Ciclovía – began in 1974, and has aided the city’s transformation into a cycling paradise. Thanks to ex-mayor Enrique Peñalosa’s commitment to creating a healthy, car-free city, a network of over 200 miles of bike-only lanes serves Bogotá. For Peñalosa, “a citizen on a $30 bicycle is equally important to one in a $30,000 car”. After leaving office in 2001, he was elected as mayor once again this weekend. In Hyderabad’s IT corridor (dubbed “Cyberabad”), a recently launched weekly car ban marks a first for Indian cities. And in South Korea, a Suwon neighbourhood recently trialled a full month ban in September 2013, which inspired the wealthy Sandton area of Johannesburg to hosts its own car-free experiment last month. Every week in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, more than 75 miles of urban roads are shut to vehicles But during the dawn of the automobile age, when cities were designed around the beloved family motor, it takes a lot of effort to make a U-turn. The average US commuter spends around 42 hours a year stuck in a traffic jam (or double that, if you live in LA), but Portland hopes to change this by having 25% of trips made on two wheels by 2030. The city also opened a pedestrian, bike and public transit-only bridge across the River. While the rest of the country was building cities where the car is king, Davis, the largest city in Yolo County, California, adopted a carefree, car-free attitude when it came to urban infrastructure. While modal share for cycling just scrapes an average of 2% in the US, in Davis it’s 20%. Over to Canada, where Toronto’s commuter congestion costs the city C$6bn (£2.9 bn) annually. Alongside the expansion of the subway system, segregated bike lanes are slowly creeping into North America’s fifth largest city, and there are whispers around a potential car-free street during rush hour. This is certainly a turnaround from the city’s direction under the leadership of former mayor Rob Ford, who spent C$300,000 to remove a major bike lane (which had seen a 300% increase in cycling) in order to save car-commuters two minutes on their journey home. Kicking the car habit in well-developed municipalities poses a challenge, but built-from-scratch cities provide urban planners with the opportunity to start completely afresh. Great City, a development on the outskirts of Chengdu, China will be constructed from scratch with space for 80,000 residents – none of whom will need a car to get around thanks to a mass-transit system rendering cars nearly useless. Home to some of the world’s most polluted cities, China’s newest conurbation will generate 60% less CO2 than a more conventional city of a similar size. Masdar, an eco-city rising from the desert near Abu Dhabi will also keep non-electric (and driverless) cars out of the centre, encouraging walking and cycling instead. Across the globe, it’s estimated that around 7 million annual deaths are linked to air pollution exposure, not to mention the millions more killed in accidents relating to cars each year. The European commission has already unveiled desires for a “single transport area” in 2011 with a primary focus on eliminating “conventionally fuelled” cars in cities, geared towards a 60% cut in CO2 emissions by 2050. With so many car-free measures taking shape across the globe – from heavily polluted Hyderabad to green, utopian Copenhagen – city leaders are waking up to the importance of planning places for citizens that both aid sustainable urban development, while also improving quality of life. In a few weeks, world leaders will assemble in Paris for what’s set to be the world’s biggest climate conference yet, seeking to come to an international agreement on measures to keep global warming below 2C. Will car-free cities be high on the agenda?"
"Saudi Arabia stood accused on Tuesday of trying to wreck the Paris climate summit in order to protect its future as one of the world’s largest oil producers. As the talks entered the home stretch, developing country negotiators and campaigners became increasingly vocal in their complaints that the kingdom was getting in the way of a deal.   “They are seeing the writing on the wall,” said Wael Hmaidan, director of Climate Action Network, the global campaign group. “The world is changing and it’s making them very nervous.” Those concerns about the future for an economy almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels was reflected in the negotiations, other observers said. “Anything that would increase ambition or fast forward this energy transition that is already taking place is something that they try to block,” Hmaidan said. Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Until it was eclipsed by the US, the Saudi kingdom was the world’s largest oil producer and currently ranks as the 10th largest polluter, according to Enerdata. Saudi Arabia has long played a high-profile presence at annual climate summits operating from the luxuriously appointed pavillions of the Gulf Co-operation Council – and over the years has regularly been accused of blocking action on climate change. In the run-up to the Paris summit, however, the kingdom adopted a more amenable posture. Last month it delivered a plan to fight climate change, pledging a “significant deviation” in emissions, but was the last G20 country to submit its offer to the United Nations, and analysts described the targets as opaque. Last May, Ali al-Naimi acknowledged the global economy was moving away from fossil fuels – and said that Saudi Arabia was prepared to move with it.   “In Saudi Arabia, we recognise that eventually, one of these days, we are not going to need fossil fuels. I don’t know when, in 2040, 2050 or thereafter,” he said. Oil analysts note the kingdom also faces enormous domestic pressure to diversity its electricity supply. Nearly all of Saudi Arabia’s domestic electricity supply comes from oil, and keeping the lights on and air conditioners humming is taking up a growing share of production that would otherwise have been sold for export.  Behind the closed doors of negotiating sessions, however, the Saudis have strenuously resisted efforts to enshrine ambitious goals into the text of a Paris agreement. The Saudis objected even to the mention of 1.5C – a new more ambitious target for limiting warming now endorsed by more than 100 countries including vulnerable low-lying states and big polluters such as the European Union and US. The kingdom balked at the goal of decarbonising the economy by 2050. The Saudis have also objected to demands for periodic reviews of climate plans, according to accounts from negotiators and observers. Saudi delegates complain that submitting a climate plan before Paris was difficult enough.  “It is unacceptable for developing countries, like my own, to be asked to participate in this so called ratchet mechanism,” the Saudis were reported to have told the session. “It was tough, we had to go to every ministry, every part of government. We developing countries don’t have the capacity to do this every five years. We are too poor, we have too many other priorities. It’s unacceptable,” a Saudi delegate said. And although Saudia Arabia ranks as the world’s 15th largest economy, it has resisted efforts to grow the Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries cope with global warming – insisting only industrialised countries contribute. Saudi negotiators have also demanded that if tiny islands like Kiribati be compensated for climate change, they should also be protected from loss of future oil income, and they have sought financial aid to acquire new green energy technology.  By Tuesday, the Saudi obstruction had even begun to rankle with other members of the Arab League, campaign groups said. Egypt officially embraced the 1.5C goal at the start of the talks. However, Arab countries as a bloc have yet to endorse the more ambitious target – even though countries such as Morocco are hosting next year’s UN talks and have been praised as a progressive country on climate change. “We feel Saudi Arabia is playing a bully role in undermining the position of other Arab countries,” Hmaidan said. “It is unfortunate that the Arab group is the only group opposing 1.5C.”    "
"The world’s biggest climate polluters rallied around a stronger target for limiting warming on Monday, saying they were open to the 1.5C goal endorsed by the most vulnerable countries. In the final push to a climate agreement, the US, Canada, China and the European Union declared they were now on board with demands from African countries to adopt an even more ambitious goal to limit warming.  “We can’t go home and say ’we saved the planet, check.’ This issue will continue to be a top priority for the president and the White House coming out of Paris heading into next year and for remaining time that he is in office because there is more work to do,” a White House official said. Small island states say the current temperature goal of 2C would bring doom, drowning low-lying areas, and forcing mass migration. They want an agreement from Paris that would seek to keep warming at around 1C, which is about the current level of warming above pre-industrial levels. In the last few days, the 1.5C target has become short-hand for reaching a more ambitious agreement that would keep pace with real-time changes already underway on the ground. “We are working with other countries on some formulation that would include 1.5C,” Todd Stern, the State Department envoy, told a press conference. China said it was supporting a 1.5C target and for rich countries to accept the principle that they are responsible for long term and irreversible damage done by climate change.  “There are some things that you cannot adapt to. We need to see something to address permanent losses,” said a spokesman for the G77 and China group of 132 countries. A Chinese spokesman said: “We stand with other developing countries.” Canada, regarded as a climate villain for the last decade, also came around with Catherine McKenna, the new environment and climate change minister, embracing 1.5C in closed door sessions. The EU spokeswoman Carole Dieschebourg said ministers were “open” to a 1.5C target. “The difficult issues will be finance and differentiation,” she said, referring to the idea that rich countries should do more than poor countries. “We have a difficult week ahead. All the major issues are unresolved.” But there were some prominent hold-outs. India said the 1.5C target raised immediate issues of fairness because it would put greater limits on capacity of developing countries to grow their economies. “Why not 1C, why 1.5C,” Ashok Lavasa, India’s lead negotiator, said. “The moment we are talking about target we are also talking about carbon budgets. We need to look at the development space that is available and therefore those who are eager to maintain it below 2C should actually be working to maintain that carbon space so that they don’t compromise the needs of developing countries.” Campaign groups meanwhile said the aspiration to 1.5C was far-removed from reality. The current pledges from 185 countries won’t even restrict warming to 2C. Erich Pica, the director of Friends of the Earth US, accused the rich countries of backing vulnerable states on the 1.5C goal to crowd out bigger developing countries.  “There is a dangerous push that developed countries are using on this push to 1.5C to blur the lines,” he said. “The US and European countries are adopting the idea of 1.5C as a mitigation target but they are blurring of the lines on what has to happen to have a just and fair sharing of the 1.5C equation.” Ban Ki-Moon, the UN secretary-general, also sounded an urgent tone, warning “the clock is ticking towards a climate catastrophe”."
"For too many people around the world, climate change is, without any exaggeration, at their front door. It won’t be long before more Americans – in Florida and across the south-east, for instance – will have to live with and confront these risks every day. That’s why the Paris climate talks are so important.  There are 31 Alaskan villages already facing “imminent threats” from warming ocean waters, erosion and flooding, according to a 2009 Government Accountability Office assessment. At least a dozen have relocated or are exploring relocation options. The same is happening elsewhere, both in the US and around the world.  That’s why Barack Obama recently made a historic trip to Alaska to raise awareness of climate change’s devastating impacts on the state’s seas, land and people. As he very rightly said at the time: “climate change is no longer some far-off problem ... [I]t is happening here. It is happening now”. His visit put the spotlight right where it needs to be: on the people already seeing the impacts that lie ahead if we don’t take action. One of the threatened Alaskan villages, Shishmaref, is located on the barrier island of Sarichef. Over the years, the Inupiat community who live there have seen their coastline vanish, sometimes by as much as 20 feet a year. The community dates back some 400 years and now faces the harsh reality that peoples’ homes are literally disappearing.  The Inupiat must decide whether to leave their ancestral land, which has sustained them and kept their traditions alive for centuries. The cost of moving each of the approximately 600 villagers is estimated at $300,000 per resident – if an appropriate inland site can be found at all. Around 4,000 miles to the south, the Republic of the Marshall Islands – a beautiful chain of 29 low-lying coral atolls and five islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean – is facing the same problem. The atolls of the Marshall Islands are narrow and practically level with the sea, leaving their 68,000 residents nowhere to go as rising sea levels and increasingly frequent floods threaten to swamp the country. The country’s limited water supply is already at risk from flooding as salt water inundates fresh water sources and damages scarce agricultural land. These threats are not confined to Alaska and the Marshall Islands – the mainland US is at risk. According to a July report from the Risky Business Project: “If we continue on our current greenhouse gas emissions pathway, the southeastern United States and Texas will likely experience significant drops in agricultural yield and labor productivity, along with increased sea level rise, higher energy demand, and rising mortality rates”. The report highlighted the fact that the region is “heavily invested in physical manufacturing, agriculture and energy infrastructure” – each of which face severe climate-related risks in the near future. This phenomenon shows no signs of stopping by itself. A report released earlier this year by the US Geological Survey found that climate changes during the 21st century are expected to make the highest waves even higher and the strongest winds even stronger across the Pacific Islands. There is now a real risk that a “King Wave”, as they are already known in the Marshall Islands, could sweep everyone on the island into the Pacific Ocean. The Marshallese, like the Inupiat in Alaska, cannot afford the luxury of viewing climate change as a myth. Deniers who reject the overwhelming evidence of climate change only need to visit Shishmaref or the Marshalls to see the physical evidence of rising seas and the damage they’re doing to human life. The debate we all needed to have years ago, and is now happening in Paris, is what to do about these risks. The least we can do is put aside false arguments about whether this is important enough to take action. We need to mitigate the impacts of rising seas and temperatures for vulnerable populations already feeling the heat. We also need to do it for the rest of us, because we won’t be immune to these and other climate risks in the future.  If we keep posturing instead of taking meaningful action, too many of us – from the United States to Europe to south-east Asia to the Pacific – will wake up one day soon and find our own homes at risk, no easy avenues for retreat in sight and no explanation for why we waited too long to act."

"Poor countries at climate talks in Paris have railed against an attempt to water down assistance promised to help them overcome the climate crisis they did not cause. Rich countries are committed to provide $100bn (£66bn) to developing countries by 2020. More than any other, this figure will decide the fate of the talks billed to stop climate change.  On Wednesday, US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern had told a press conference that donor countries were “well on the way to beating that pledge”. Stern said a “conservative” report compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a thinktank sponsored by the richest countries on Earth, in October “showed on the basis of 2014 numbers we are around $62bn, probably a little bit more than that”.  For the period between now and 2020, he said: “There have since that time been a number of pledges made both by individual countries... I think if you look at all of those pledges, plus what the OECD have already totalled up... we are at a pretty high number, both where we are now and where we’ll be over the next few years.” And yet the problem of the $100bn is not whether it will be reached – it almost certainly will – but how. There is an almighty gap between how the developing and developed worlds define what counts as adequate climate assistance. Within the monies the OECD counted as climate finance was a vast range of loans, grants and aid relabelled as climate-related, much of which developing countries do not see as assistance but investment. On top of this, the OECD model adds in the private capital “mobilised” by the trickle of public cash. For example, Germany and France have promised to increase their 2020 finance to $4.47bn and $4bn respectively. Yet despite the similar numbers, grant-making Germany is seen as a leader and money-lending France a villain. For developing countries, loans are a particularly problematic aspect of this methodology. Gambia’s environment minister, and representative of the least developed countries group, Pa Ousman Jarju said: “We cannot take loans to pay for climate change and take that as climate finance. For us it needs to be grant-based finance because we are not responsible for what is happening.” Stern’s upbeat analysis was scorned by Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, the South African chair of the Group of 77 and China, who speaks for the poorest 134 countries in the negotiations. She called the OECD report a “mirage” that was being used to create the illusion of a finance process on the right track. “We had been asking for work to be done by the [UN] standing committee on finance. An institution of the convention. And every time we asked, those requests were refused,” said Mxakato-Diseko. Instead, she said, wealthy countries had elevated the methodology of a thinktank to de facto UN climate policy, without consultation. “We woke up to find that we had a report that was telling us that we were accomplishing [$100bn]. We were not aware of that report. We were not aware that countries had mandated that report,” she said. Oxfam’s climate policy adviser Jan Kowalzig said: “It’s deeply concerning that a donor-driven methodology like that of the OECD is being used to champion rich country climate funding [as being] at a pivotal stage in sealing a climate deal. The system is far from perfect and, critically, is based on donor countries’ choices on what and how to count, allowing funding levels to look higher than they actually are.” There is just one day of talks left before negotiators must hand over a workable draft to their various ministers for the second phase of deal-making. For the US, using the OECD methodology puts the talismanic $100bn within reach, defusing an issue insiders say has become utterly intransigent. A second tortured sore is the balance between funding for “adaptation” – coping with the effects of climate change – and “mitigation”, carbon cutting interventions. Mitigation tends to attract vastly more finance because its profile – renewable energy, forestry, agriculture - comes with readymade business models and can convince private capital to provide additional help. Because of this, mitigation attracts roughly three quarters of all climate finance. Adaptation, much of which involves improving infrastructure, offers no such ready profit model and generally requires grants. The African negotiating bloc has called for adaptation finance to reach $32bn a year by 2020. But Kowalzig said that even with new pledges, public adaptation money was only likely to amount to $5-8bn per year in 2020.  “If today’s public adaptation finance were divided among the world’s 1.5 billion smallholder farmers in developing countries, they would get around $3 each year to cope with climate change – the price of a cup of coffee in many rich countries,” he said."
"Indigenous groups from across the world staged a paddle down the Seine river in Paris on Sunday, calling on governments to ensure Indigenous rights are included in the United Nations climate pact currently being negotiated in France. The United States, the EU, Australia and other states have pushed for Indigenous rights to be dropped from the binding parts of the agreement out of fear that it could create legal liabilities.  Indigenous representatives from North and South America, Indonesia and Congo played instruments and led others in prayer amid the smell of burning sage after activists completed the paddle, demanding the protection of water and the environment. Recognition of Indigenous rights initially appeared in the text of the Paris Accord, where it would have been legally binding and enforceable – but under pressure from Norway and other countries, it was moved to a preamble that is only aspirational and non-binding. Reports have shown that ensuring Indigenous communities have secure lands rights can reduce deforestation and prevent billions of tonnes of carbon emissions from being emitted every year. Indigenous groups have been lobbying since the Bali climate change conference in 2007 to ensure that any UN climate projects respect and recognize the rights of Indigenous peoples. Albert Saldamando, an international human rights lawyer, said that Indigenous peoples are concerned they will be at risk of further displacement from their lands if there isn’t concrete recognition of their rights. World Bank-led projects for forest and conservation offsets that are overseen by the United Nations disproportionately impact their territories around the world, he said. “At the moment the rights of Indigenous Peoples all over the globe are being violated by ‘green climate projects’ – such as hydropower dams – in the name of ‘climate mitigation’. If such violations are happening now, imagine what will come with a legally binding document, where the rights of Indigenous Peoples are not guaranteed,” said Eriel Deranger, member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Canada. In October in Bonn at a pre-Paris negotiating session, mention of Indigenous rights disappeared but was reinserted after protests by the Philippines.  According to Saldamando, small island states have also been good allies, as well as Canada, Mexico and Costa Rica. He said with sufficient pressure, recognition of Indigenous rights could be still be added back in the last week of negotiations. “We cannot negotiate a climate agreement at this critical time without the recognition of the rights of Indigenous Peoples, who are on the front lines of the impacts of climate change and the innovators of solutions we need to stabilize our climate,” said Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network. Crystal Lameman,Treaty coordinator for the Beaver Lake Cree First Nation, watched the paddlers come down the Seine on Sunday, after having travelled from her territory in Canada’s tar sands region. “We belong in this treaty and we have a place in this discussion. Our future and the future of our children are not up for negotiation.”"
"Five big developed countries have voluntarily cancelled emission reduction “credits” achieved by overshooting their first Kyoto Protocol greenhouse targets – the same kind of credits Australia is banking to boast it has already “met and beaten” its international pledges.  Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain have announced they will cancel 634.6m tonnes of emission reduction credits they were technically able to count towards their targets for the second Kyoto period, in a bid to overcome what has been described as a giant “hot air” loophole. Australia, in stark contrast, is banking 128m tonnes of carryover from overshooting its lenient target in the first Kyoto commitment period and using it to be able to claim – as the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, did in his speech to the Paris summit – that it is already on track to meet its second pledge. “By cancelling surplus units we hope to send a strong positive signal of support for an ambitious global climate agreement here in Paris,” the European nations said in a joint statement.  Deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute Erwin Jackson said the European countries were demonstrating a commitment to actually reduce emissions by cancelling the same kind of credits on which Australia is counting.  “The Australian government has previously committed to do the same. Our current 2020 target is woefully inadequate. Strengthening our 2020 target though cancelling leftover emissions credits would close the gap between what we currently have on the table and what other leading nations doing,” Jackson said. In the lead-up to the United Nations meeting, Australia’s environment minister, Greg Hunt, announced that Australia had already met its 2020 greenhouse emissions reduction target in large part due to overshooting its first lenient Kyoto target in 2012. (Unlike most developed countries, Australia was allowed to increase its emissions by 8% by that date, an achievement it knew it had already when it signed on to the pledge because it also secured special rules to allow it to count a reduction in land clearing that had already happened.) Most forecasts show Australia’s actual emissions will rise by 2020. The latest analysis by the research firm RepuTex shows they will rise 4% by 2020 compared with 2000 levels, and 6% compared with today. The government has not yet released its updated actual emission projections. Hunt described the idea that the government should consider actual emissions rather than achieving a target via accounting rules as “one of the oddest and strangest and I’ve got to say ... desperate arguments” he had heard, and pointed out that the accounting rules had been accepted internationally and by successive Australian governments. Asked again in Paris when Australia’s actual emissions would start falling he said “what matters for Australia is that we achieve our targets”. In the Paris announcement, Germany has also promised to cancel any surplus it achieves in the second commitment period – out to 2020 – and not count it against the longer term targets being pledged in Paris. The Australian government has promised a longer-term climate pledge of reducing emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030. Hunt said that overshooting the 2020 target might once again allow Australia to use the accounting rules to “carry over” reductions to help meet the 2030 target. “The rules haven’t been set, so of course that is an option which Australia would consider,” he said last month. A spokesman for Hunt said Australia would not be forfeiting its carryover."
"Winter freeze-ups and phew-what-a-scorcher summers may traditionally have made more dramatic headlines for newspapers, but in Britain the real threat from climate change today comes from flooding. The rains that hit north-west England and southern Scotland over the weekend were certainly exceptional. A record 341.4mm of rain fell at Honister in the Lake District. And the storms had devastating consequences. One man has died, 3,500 homes have been flooded, more than 2,000 of them in Carlisle, while road, rail and power links have all been cut. Yet this year’s floods were hardly unusual.  The floods of December 2015 follow, among many others, floods in 2014 in Somerset and the Thames valley, floods in north Yorkshire and Tyneside in 2012, floods in West Cumberland in 2009, floods in the Severn Valley in 2007 and floods in Carlisle in 2005. This is getting to be almost an annual event. Those who are at the sharp end are entitled to be angry. It is high time we learned the lessons better and got the measure of the problems more thoroughly. The first thing we need to learn is to stop talking about once-in-a-century risks. Many of the worst affected areas in the current floods are places that have already been through bad floods in the past few years. Several had been equipped with sturdier and more comprehensive flood defences, which have held up against recent but lesser flood threats, as David Cameron was right to point out when he visited Carlisle on Monday. Yet when the rains came this time those defences were overwhelmed. Cockermouth, on the edge of the Lake District, was inundated in 2009 when eight-foot-deep floods coursed through the town centre. Since then, a £4.4m system of flood barriers has been installed to protect the town from its two rivers. But still the floods came back to Cockermouth at the weekend. For some people in the town, this was the fourth flood in a decade. Things can’t go on like this. When a house is flooded, the consequences are awful: physical dangers, damaged homes, written-off possessions and insurance claims are just the start of it. That these things should happen at a celebratory time of year – as is the case with many recent floods – is particularly miserable. But the effects endure beyond midwinter, sometimes for years, in the shape of the long clean-up, living in temporary accommodation, delayed insurance claims, increased premiums for householders and businesses, and in the exhaustion and trauma. Those who have experienced one flood will often live in fear of another whenever the heavy rains come. They should not have to do so. Local people, the emergency services and civil society performed heroically this weekend. In the end, though, only the state has the authority and money, working with and through local government, to sort these problems out in the long term. That has to be the government’s priority, not just while the floods are still on the bulletins and front pages, but right through until the job is done. The current government talks a lot about its commitment to infrastructure. George Osborne is fond of claiming that “we are the builders”. Surely this is therefore the time for the builders to build the infrastructure that people want and need. It’s time for the government to put its money where its mouth is. Flood defences are much greater priorities for those affected by these recurrent floods than HS2 or a third runway at Heathrow. Every pound spent on keeping communities dry and protected saves £10 in damage. It also brings the wider social and economic dividends that come with security. Not every home can be defended against the sea or the floods all the time. As a last resort, some communities may have to move. And we need to understand that flood defences are still doing their job if they delay the flooding before being overwhelmed by it, as happened in several places this weekend. In the longer term a strategic response must contain a mix of ecologically smart strategies, rather than making a sole priority everywhere of dredging and channelling rivers which can then become even more lethal in spate. This country builds too much on flood plains. That must change too. Although much more must be done on the ground, the fate of homes in these islands is also umbilically linked to the fate of the climate change talks in Paris. A treaty will not stop the rain. But a treaty will play its part, over time, in shaping climate change so that threatened communities do not have to look so fearfully and so often at the rising waters and say to themselves: “No, not again.”"

"Are you still as optimistic as you were before the summit started? If you listen to the 150 heads of the state or government that gave their speeches on Monday (30 November), it is obvious that there is a political willingness to reach an agreement in Paris.  But if you compared that with the progress made in the technical discussions, the first two days have not cleared any of the many open issues of the draft text, and we have not closed any of the fundamental chapters required for an ambitious agreement. Therefore, there is political will but limited progress in the technical talks. It means that the ministers will have to get involved in the process. The technical work should have prepared a draft text so the ministers could have agreed on the remaining substantial issues. But the situation is that all the elements remain open. Everybody is in their comfort zones. Nobody is doing proposals to reach a consensus or a compromise. This is what the EU is trying to do, to start closing the gaps between groups which are very divided. What could prevent a deal? The main bone of contention now is the position of many developing countries wanting to maintain the difference made in 1992 [during the Kyoto protocol] between developed and developing countries. It is a model in which the developed countries adopted some targets while the developing nations received financial aid for climate adaptation. But the world has changed substantially since then and today, you cannot consider many of these countries as developing nations anymore. The Kyoto model is not useful anymore, even less if we want an agreement for the whole century, as developed economies will have a lot of problems while emerging economies are growing at 10% and they have very substantial economic resources. What do you want to achieve in Paris? Our goal is to stop global warming and limit the rise of temperature to 2C. Therefore we want an agreement with three basic elements. A long-term target by including in the protocol that our goal is to limit the global warming to 2C. Secondly, a 2050 target of a 50% cut in CO2 emissions globally, which means a 80-95% reduction for the developed countries, as we have more capabilities, more technology and more financial resources. Finally, we would need a review process every five years to see where we are. The 188 national contributions for emissions cuts limit global warming to 3C, therefore every five years all the parties should meet to analyse how they have implemented their climate change policies and to see the remaining gap with the 2C target. This review process is one of the most important elements for the EU. China and the US seem to be on board. Will it be part of the final deal? Basically, we got the US and China’s support for the configuration of the mechanism. But the devil is in the details. China accepts the 2C target but refuses a specific target for 2050. The US support us on the need of transparent rules and accountability to fix a unified process for developing and developed countries. But there are differences on whether, once we analyse every five years where we are, the countries should necessarily increase their ambition or it would be rather on a voluntary basis. Contrary to Kyoto, which was a top-down approach with binding targets and sanctions, this time around the parties have established their targets freely and, luckily, it has been successful. With this more discretional method, we have 188 countries with national targets representing 98% of the global emissions, compared to 38 countries in Kyoto representing 12% of global emissions. Regarding the US, what wording could be used to save the Congress’ opposition to a legally binding treaty? The US admits that the protocol should have binding elements. It is not a complete refusal. These binding elements should be the long term target, the review process and the rules of transparency and accountability. The problem is that their national target for the emissions cut cannot be binding, since this would require ratification by the Congress and the Senate. We are looking for intermediate formulas between their position and the EU and the developing nations’ camp in favour of a binding agreement, because it is clear that we need an inclusive and universal agreement. Now we are in that complex stage of the negotiation of how to guarantee to the rest of the nations that the required national policies would be in place to meet the targets. We are working on the wording to reflect the US political willingness to address climate change. How likely is that at the end of the Paris conference there will be an agreement? The climate change agreements happen in the eleventh hour. That is the tradition, because the most difficult parts are left for the end, and it is an overall package. In light of the progress made in the technical talks I don’t expect an agreement before Friday next week. Would it be necessary to bring back the leaders? No. The leaders were part of the drafting in Copenhagen and it was an absolute catastrophe. Therefore what is needed now is that the experts assume their responsibility and from Saturday on the ministers lead the political discussion to overcome the last bones of contention. Speaking of Copenhagen, despite of the EU’s ambition and hard work, China and the US have taken centre stage in Paris. Are you afraid of Europe being marginalized from the final talks between the ‘big players’, as happened in 2009? What I am afraid of is that an alliance between the US and China could lead us to an agreement with little ambition. Therefore we are forging alliances with all the developing countries, with the Pacific Islands, with the most progressive countries in this field in Latin America and Africa to go for very ambitious targets. We are in a very good position because we have the most ambitious targets and the most progressive legislation in energy and environment. Even more, we are the most supportive block in terms of climate change financing. Between 2009 and 2013, up to 56% of the financial aid for the developing nations [to support adaptation and mitigation for climate change] came from the EU. We are very well positioned in this summit with a lot of ambition and solidarity, and a lot of coherence in our domestic policies. All of these give us an authoritative voice for the negotiations. Others make a lot of announcements, but we follow a consistent policy, leading by facts and not only by words. To what extent is this US-China alliance is possible? We have bilateral contacts with both Washington and Beijing, almost on a daily basis. Is there a risk? All risks exist in serious negotiations, but we want to be part of this alliance to push toward an ambitious accord. "
" In Paris this week, world leaders are working to agree a robust climate deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They are also grappling with how to tackle the pervasive threat of terror. The aim in both cases is to safeguard the right of current and future generations to live safe, secure and fulfilled lives. The fact that the climate conference is taking place in Paris grimly underscores this duality. But it isn’t simply that tackling climate change and insecurity are parallel challenges. They are linked risks that need to be met with linked responses.  Even if we get the best possible global agreement to cut emissions in Paris, the effects of warming already in the system will play out for at least the next two decades, with an impact on conflict, security and fragility. Climate change plays a role in the ongoing political conflicts in Darfur and Mali, and in food insecurity across the Sahel. Climate change has also complicated conflicts linked to the Arab spring, most notably in Syria.   Of course, no conflict has a single cause. Rather, climate change can exacerbate issues that can already cause conflict, such as unemployment, volatile food prices and political grievances, making them harder to manage and increasing the risk of political instability or violence.  For example, Syria’s 2006-2011 drought was the nail in the coffin, making fragile livelihoods of rural farmers untenable. With failing crop yields and falling incomes, many left to move to urban centres, such as Daraa, putting a strain on weak infrastructure and scant basic services. It wasn’t the drought in itself that caused the conflict, but the existing social, political and economic tensions.  The effects of climate change, such as more frequent hurricanes, long-term changes in rainfall and temperatures, and rising sea-levels are not experienced in isolation. They combine with social, political or economic factors already at play. In fragile contexts, where poverty, weak governance and conflict are frequent and the ability to cope with these risks is low, climate change increases the risk of violent conflict. Research conducted by International Alert for the G7 group of leading industrial economies found that climate change is the ultimate multiplier of threats. Climate change will continue to inhibit peace unless it is effectively integrated into managing risk and building resilience. Many of those most affected by climate change live in fragile states, where underdevelopment is intractable. The response to recent floods in the UK are unlikely to push local communities towards violence. Yet in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the impact of devastating floods combined with poverty, endemic corruption and long-standing perceptions of marginalisation by Delhi have all created such tensions that failure by local or central government to respond adequately could pose a very real risk of violence or political instability. This will make it harder for affected communities to adapt to climate change and for authorities to provide adequate support in building resilience, locking them into a vicious cycle of conflict, poverty and climate vulnerability. There is much that can be done to ensure that climate change does not lead to increased conflict. Addressing the root causes of vulnerability to the effects of climate change – such as the lack of livelihood diversification, political marginalisation, unsustainable management of natural resources, weak or inflexible institutions and unfair policy processes – can help ensure countries plan for uncertainty and peacefully manage future risks.  The best way to reduce the threat is to get the best possible deal at the talks in Paris. But with dramatic changes already under way, people need to adapt. And how people and governments adapt, especially in fragile contexts, is critical.  Better policy responses are required to ensure that how we tackle climate change does not inadvertently fuel conflict. For example, a push towards renewable energy in 2007 saw a switch of land use from food production to growing crops for biofuels, which was perceived to contribute to higher food prices and resultant food riots in more than 40 countries around the world.  If we want to reduce the risk of people falling into extremism through education, training and jobs, we need to make sure that those skills and jobs are “climate-proof”. There would be little value in providing support for farming to unemployed young Syrians when long-term drought is the reason they cannot pursue a livelihood in farming.  Whatever happens in Paris, there will be new money for tackling climate change. If these resources address vulnerability, they could achieve the triple win of building resilience to climate change, conflict and poverty. Supporting the provision of sustainable livelihoods in Mali, buffering communities from the volatility of food prices in import-dependent countries like Yemen, and ensuring social safety nets are in place to protect the poorest when subsidies are removed in Egypt, will all address some of the root causes of conflict as well as vulnerability to climate impacts. We need leaders in Paris to agree a global deal to reduce emissions. We need adequate funds to support the poorest and most vulnerable to adapt. And we need to find ways for developing countries to progress in a low-carbon way. Single-sector interventions will not deal with compound risks. Integrating policies and responses in three sectors – climate change adaptation, development and humanitarian aid, and peace-building – is critical to ensure efforts on all three fronts can strengthen resilience to climate-conflict risks and create a climate of lasting peace. "
"They may not be household names but collectively global food companies Cargill, Tyson and Yara have a bigger climate footprint than the Netherlands, Vietnam or Colombia, according to a new analysis. The startling revelation from the NGO Global Justice Now comes at a time when fossil fuel companies such as Shell and BP continue to dominate discussions about climate change. Far less attention has been paid to the agri-food sector, despite as much as 29% of global emissions being associated with food production. At present food companies only report their direct emissions, which include their own energy use but often exclude the vast majority of indirect emissions from their supply chains. US animal feed manufacturer Cargill, for example, declares its official annual emissions as 15m tonnes. If it included the emissions arising from growing feed crops and their use by livestock then its climate impact, according to Global Justice Now’s new findings, would be an estimated 145m tonnes. Likewise, Tyson, the largest beef producer in the US, declares its emissions at 5m tonnes but does not include emissions related to the rearing of livestock. If it did its climate emissions would be 34m tonnes, suggests the analysis. The report found Yara, one of the world’s fertiliser producers, has a climate impact of nearly 75m tonnes, when emissions relating to the use of its fertilisers are taken into account, rather than the 12.5m tonnes that it declares.  The result is millions of tonnes of climate emissions that are otherwise being hidden from public knowledge. In the case of Cargill, its undeclared climate emissions of 130m tonnes are comparable to the combined national emissions of Denmark, Bulgaria and Sweden. “They shouldn’t be able to indulge themselves in the fiction that they are not culpable for these indirect climate impacts,” says Alex Scrivener, policy officer at Global Justice Now and co-author of the analysis, who adds that Yara, Tyson and Cargill are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to evaluating the climate emissions produced by agri-food companies. Campaigners have been particularly critical of Yara and Tyson for their membership of a two different climate-smart agriculture initiatives – the Global Alliance on Climate Smart Agriculture and World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The term itself – climate-smart agriculture – has been accused of being almost meaningless. “We now know the big oil and coal companies are creating environmental havoc, but agribusiness still gets away with painting itself as the ‘solution to climate change’ despite causing huge damage to the climate,” says Scrivener. To be taken seriously food companies need to move away from headline-grabbing projects that only focus on one part of their supply chain, says environmental non-profit CDP. “We prefer big targets that cover the true scope of their operations and supply chain rather than niche projects they market the heck out of to give the impression they are doing more than they are,” says CDP’s head of supply chains Dexter Galvin. “They talk about getting their own house in order but most have outsourced their emissions to their supply chain.” In response to the analysis, the companies say they are not ignoring their indirect emissions but that it is unlikely that they will start reporting on it soon.  Cargill says it is working to reduce emissions across its supply chains but that “measuring that progress in a quantifiable way is a separate challenge; admittedly, it’s something we – and many others – are still trying to figure out.”  Tyson says the farmers raising its livestock operate independently and, as such, it would be a difficult to report these emissions. Yara says it is helping to reduce emissions through sharing knowledge on more efficient farming techniques and supporting research to reduce emissions from fertiliser application. “Obviously companies aren’t as responsible for indirect emissions as they are for direct emissions. But I think most people would recognise that, at the very least, companies need to be aware of the impact of their supply chain and end use of their products, and make this information public,” says Scrivener. While the focus of the findings were on global agri-food businesses, Tara Garnett, coordinator of the food climate research network at Oxford University, says the responsibility for climate emissions lies across the food chain with consumers who eat the food and supermarkets who sell it, as well as manufacturers like Cargill and Tyson who produce it. "
"The term “glacial pace” takes on real and literal meaning with climate change. The disappearance of our glaciers may have hastened dramatically, but our efforts to stop them doing so have moved at a truly glacial pace. This has to change, right now. Since the Kyoto protocol came into being, we have failed miserably to protect our planet. Current trajectories show the world is on track towards a temperature rise of about 3C by 2100. Climate talks in Paris this month are our last chance to turn the tide.  We have long known that Africa, which causes the least environmental damage, suffers the most from the harm others cause. The World Meteorological Organisation recorded more than 1,300 climate-related natural disasters in Africa from 1970 to 2012, which claimed 700,000 lives and caused economic damage worth $26.6bn (£17.6bn).  A decade ago, at COP 11 in Montreal in 2005, Africa had no common position and no common negotiators. This year, at COP 21, it has a Conference of African Heads of State on Climate Change; it has an expert team of about 200 climate negotiators; it has a clearly outlined position on the negotiations; and it has a well-articulated collective work programme to support low-carbon and climate-resilient development on the continent.  So Africa means business on climate change. It comes to Paris not just with hope, but with something to offer. It brings three big “gives” to the rest of the world, and three big “asks”. First, Africa gives its own commitment – and the cast-iron evidence – that it will join the rest of the world in taking climate change seriously. Forty-seven out of 53 countries in Africa had already completed their “intended nationally determined contributions” by the 1 October deadline. Each national plan states what the country can do, from tiny Comoros committing to cutting emissions by 85% in 15 years, to Ethiopia announcing plans to cut its emissions growth by 64% in the same period. African countries have demonstrated greater ambition in cutting their emissions than the high-emitting nations.  Second, Africa makes the gift – to itself and the world – of its enormous renewable energy resources. That potential is breathtaking: the continent can source an additional 10 terawatts of solar energy, 1,300 gigawatts of wind power, and 15GW of geothermal potential. That power, if used to the full and responsibly managed, will not just solve Africa’s own energy problems but also those of other countries near and far. Third, Africa gives to the world a share of the gigantic atmospheric vacuum cleaners that are its natural tropical forests. It has an estimated 650m hectares (1.605bn acres) of untouched forest, almost a fifth of the world’s stock. These carbon sinks can suck in 1.2bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – about half the carbon dioxide emissions from all the homes in the US. And they can do this, even under the threat of deforestation and forest degradation. If we can preserve our forest, for instance in the Congo basin, we can absorb more of our own and the world’s carbon dioxide. But Africa, of course, seeks support in kind from the world. It brings three “asks” to COP21, all of which are aimed at completing the circle of giving. First, Africa asks for adequate finance – at least $11bn a year – to help it adapt to climate change. Only 4% of the world’s total adaptation finance ends up in sub-Saharan Africa, a situation that demands immediate reform. Africa, which is already short-changed on climate change, must not be short-changed on climate finance. Communities that have contributed the least to climate change should not be the ones picking up the tab when Mother Earth fights back. As we write, southern and eastern Africa are suffering floods and droughts respectively, brought about by the worst El Niño – warm winds blowing off warm waters – in decades.  Second, Africa asks the world to join it in investing at least $55bn a year in its energy sector up to 2030. Why? Mainly because this would bring full energy access to more than 600 million Africans who do not have that today. Patchy energy means patchy business, patchy health and patchy education. It means diminished life. The lack of energy has put the brakes on Africa’s development. Why should the rest of the world buy into this? Because, by developing clean energy in Africa, we will collectively remove billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases from the air. And because – given the returns on renewable energy – we will collectively unlock millions of dollars in new business opportunities. Witness the solar power project in Ouarzazate in Moroccowhich has generated 500MW and cut an annual 760,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.   The third and last ask is that the countries of the world reassess the demands they are making of one another. Limiting the global temperature rise to 2C is not enough: we stand with the International Panel on Climate Change in wanting a revised target of 1.5 degrees. The continent of proverbs reminds us that “in moments of crisis, the wise build bridges”. We are indeed in a crisis, and Africa is asking the rest of the world to join us in building bridges to a safer world. So let’s be wise in Paris.  • Akinwumi Adesina is the president of the African Development Bank "
"The leaders of the UK’s two main opposition parties say they hope the Paris climate summit will encourage prime minister David Cameron to reconsider green policies. UK energy and climate chief Amber Rudd has been handed a key role at the UN talks, helping to mediate between almost 200 countries on global plans to boost greenhouse gas cuts before 2020. But critics point to a government bonfire of support for the solar and wind sector, an end to plans for thousands of ultra-efficient houses and the cancellation of a $1bn investment in carbon capture technology. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on a one-day visit to Paris, said he wanted the UK to be at the “heart” of a proposed global climate deal, “not tagging on behind”. “I hope she will be listening to the expert opinion around her which is saying we should be doing more to accept just electricity in the UK, more in promoting renewables rather than fossil fuels,” he said. Corbyn said the government should offer more finance to developing countries to help them invest in greener forms of energy and cope with future impacts like rising sea levels, floods and droughts. In September, Rudd announced a 50% rise in UK funding for poorer nations of $8.8bn up to 2021. “I’d want the government to offer more because the rhetoric on environmental sustainability must be backed up with action,” Corbyn said. “At the end of the day surely that amount of money is an investment for the whole future of the planet and the good of all of us.” Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hoped the talks would leave Rudd and Cameron “pausing for thought”. “I wish he’d be a bit more persuasive with [chancellor] George Osborne,” she said, referring to the man blamed for orchestrating the swathe of policy changes. “I’ve just come from a meeting with someone from Oceania, talking in very graphic, stark and compelling terms what it means to parts of the world like that if it doesn’t get its act together. “Anyone who’s wavering at all needs to listen to some of that. We all have an obligation to do everything we possibly can.”"
"A coalition representing more than 100 countries, formed in secrecy six months ago, has emerged at key UN talks in Paris to push for a legally binding global and ambitious deal on climate change. The “high ambition coalition” speaks for the majority of the 195 countries at the crunch conference and consists of 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, the US and all of EU member states. But notable exceptions include major developing countries such as China and India.  The group is focusing on at least four key issues. They want an agreement at Paris to be legally binding; to set a clear long-term goal on global warming that is in line with scientific advice; to introduce a mechanism for reviewing countries’ emissions commitments every five years; and create a unified system for tracking countries’ progress on meeting their carbon goals. The move is significant because it forms a major new power at the talks that wants to come to as strong an agreement as possible. Countries are meeting in Paris to forge a new global agreement on climate change, with limits on emissions and finance for poorer countries, to kick in from 2020 when current commitments expire. The Paris talks, which are now into their final days, are seen as a make-or-break meeting, because if they fail the world will lack effective collective action on global warming. Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU climate commissioner, said the alliance showed that developed and developing countries could work together with a common interest. “These negotiations are not about them and us. They are about all of us, developed and developing countries, finding common ground and solutions together. We urge other countries to join us. Together we can do it,” he said. “This is an ambition coalition,” said Giza Gaspar Martins, chair of the group of the 48 most vulnerable countries to climate change. “This is also a coalition that is open to recognising the difficulties of others, because alone, we can’t achieve that high mitigation ambition that we have.” Marshall Islands’ foreign minister, Tony de Brum, said the coalition had waited until it could have the most impact to make its work public. “This being the last three days of this meeting, there needs to be bridging. To reach out to those who still have doubts and maybe help convince them that the message that we are putting out is for real and it does makes sense and it has the support of a lot more people than may first meet the eye.” The coalition was first formed over informal drinks on the sidelines of a climate meeting in Paris in July. Pablo Vieira Samper, Colombia’s deputy environment minister, said De Brum was the “brilliant mind behind it”. A group of 15 foreign ministers, as well as Cañete, has since met in secrecy at least three times, including one meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in September in a boardroom provided by the Rockerfeller family.  On Sunday night, the ministers attended a dinner at a restaurant in central Paris, which was attended by US chief negotiator Todd Stern. The meal lasted until midnight as ministers spoke convivially and at length as they converged on issues on which they have identified common ground.  The group was initially known as “the informal ministerial gathering”, but Stern coined the name “the high ambition coalition” in a press conference on Monday. De Brum said the countries would act as a “mosquito fleet”, sending envoys to various parties with which they have bilateral ties and “bite them in a nice way”. He said he had personally requested meetings with Australia, Poland, Canada and India. None of the partners had yet reached out to the world’s biggest polluter, China. Vieira Samper said: “Our countries, negotiating groups even, might have different views and different needs. But we know that there are certain things that we all want. Of course this is something that’s open to anyone who wants to join.” But De Brum warned that while the group wanted to become broad, it would not sacrifice its core demands. “This group is not going to allow this thing to be diluted to the point that it’s a watered down agreement with really no teeth. I think that’s important. And also that we will not leave anyone behind,” said De Brum. There still appear to be some elements of divergence within the coalition though, with De Brum and Vieira Samper presenting a list of eight “points of convergence”. These differed slightly from four points the EU simultaneously made public. The Guardian understands the EU is in accord with all eight coalition demands. Ministers will meet on Tuesday night to settle on an official statement to be made on Wednesday morning. Some countries, including China and India, are understood to have reservations about potential elements of a deal. India in particular is unhappy with a five-year review of targets, and with plans to include a target of limiting future warming to 1.5C, instead of 2C which scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which extreme weather could become catastrophic and irreversible. The US wants some aspects of any deal – such as the emission targets and commitments on financial assistance to the developing world – not to be legally binding, though it may agree to the main architecture of any settlement be binding. Ministers from the 195 countries at the talks are now working on the draft text of a possible agreement. They are scheduled to finish on Thursday, leaving the mechanics of formalising an agreement under the UN’s processes for Friday, last day of the fortnight-long meeting. However, if these talks follow the pattern set at previous meetings, that timetable may slip. Note: the article was changed to more clearly represent the distinction between the EU’s announcement of four points and the eight agreed on by the coalition."
"The government has shocked the renewable energy industry by proposing a massive hike in VAT on solar panels and wind turbines from next summer. The moves, announced by the revenue and customs authority, HMRC, made “a mockery of (David) Cameron’s claims to climate leadership” say critics and come amid proposed cuts of almost 90% in some solar subsidies. HMRC blamed the planned increase in VAT from 5-20% on a European commission ruling covering energy saving materials used in the construction trade and said the EC decision had been upheld by the court of justice of the EU.  But the UK tax authorities stoked anger within the industry by claiming the changes would do little damage. “The measure is likely to affect fewer than 500,000 individuals and households and the impact … is anticipated to be negligible,” it wrote in a consultation document released on Wednesday. The Solar Trade Association (STA), lobby group for the photovoltaic sector, said it was an astonishing and avoidable blow that could add £900 to a typical domestic rooftop installation and would only serve to suck even more potential investment from low carbon power. ‘As countries are racing to secure the new global climate agreement, the UK has just proposed quadrupling VAT on solar installations for people’s homes to 20%, while oil heating, coal and gas remain on 5%. The International Energy Agency is in Paris right now calling for an end to fossil fuels subsidies just as the Treasury proposes tilting the playing field here away from clean power for British households,” “This is clearly absurd. We will be strongly urging the Treasury to treat solar the same as they propose for oil, gas, heat pumps and biomass boilers. But it is incredible to have to argue for even level VAT treatment for solar VAT just as the Paris conference demands greatly accelerated action to avoid dangerous climate change.”  The solar industry is already nervous as it waits to hear next week whether ministers will proceed with a swath of cuts to the feed in tariff subsidies.  The STA said it was hopeful ministers would reach a compromise but remained concerned thatthe cuts could still be too heavy to save a sector reeling from thousands of redundancies as business confidence evaporates. Greenpeace said the government should be resisting any misguided regulations from Brussels at a time when it was pushing for lower carbon emissions at the UN climate change talks.  “A vital part of the sustainable energy future being championed in Paris today is being undermined in London by changes to VAT that must be resisted,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.  “In addition to the confusion created by dramatic cuts to solar support, this creates a new round of uncertainty for business, and more expense for homeowners who are seeking to do their bit for the climate, as loudly requested by David Cameron last week. This move makes a mockery of Cameron’s claims to climate leadership, and shows once again that is Osborne who is ultimately holding the reins on energy policy in the UK.” Leo Murray, a campaigner for the 10:10 climate change charity, added: “Our government promised to fight this. Something very wrong is going on with the EU tax system when short haul flights are zero rated for VAT meanwhile people who are trying to do the right thing by generating their own energy are being massively penalised for buying products that are absolutely essential to meeting legally binding targets on renewable energy and our climate change objectives.” Critics want to know why some technologies such as insulation, draft-proofing, central heating and biomass boilers will not be affected by the change and yet wind and solar seem to have been singled out.  They suggest the government can avoid VAT increases if it shows that the solar panels or wind turbines are being used as part of a wider strategy to beat fuel poverty. A spokesman for HMRC said the British tax authorities had done all they could by arguing in court for a different outcome. “We lost the case. We cannot appeal or go any further so we have to make changes to the rules to comply with European law.” A government spokesperson said: “The government remains committed to improving UK homes to help tackle fuel poverty and keep energy bills low. Despite the EU’s ruling, we will continue to help the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, with the installation of energy saving materials, by retaining the vast majority of the relief on energy saving materials.”"
"Bernie Sanders will unveil a sweeping new plan to fight climate change on Monday, calling for a carbon tax and an ambitious 40% cut in carbon emissions by 2030 to speed the transition to a greener economy. The Democratic presidential candidate will use the crunch week of the climate change meeting in Paris to try to upstage rivals Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley, releasing a 16-page plan aimed at showcasing his green credentials.  The plan goes beyond Barack Obama’s climate pledges, which aim to match the European Union in ambition by calling for a 40% cut in carbon emissions by 2030 on 1990 levels, according to a copy of the plan seen by the Guardian. The 1990 starting point is a more demanding target than the current US baseline of 2005. Sanders will also call for a carbon tax, big investments in energy-saving technologies and renewable power sources, and promise to create 10 million clean energy jobs. The climate meeting in Paris has attracted an unusual level of attention compared with earlier meetings, as Democrats and Republicans gear up for the first votes in the presidential primaries just over a month away. A group of 10 Democratic senators flew to Paris to reassure the international community they would defend Obama’s climate plan. In Washington, meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have tried to block a global climate deal by trying to repeal Obama’s plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants. Sanders’ plan – which will be released as talks aimed at reaching a global agreement to fight climate change kick into a higher gear – will feature the Vermont senator’s ‘take-no-prisoners’ approach to the fossil fuel industry and climate deniers in Congress. He will call for banning fossil fuel lobbyists from the White House, and ending subsidies to fossil fuel companies. “Bernie will tax polluters causing the climate crisis, and return billions of dollars to working families to ensure the fossil fuel companies don’t subject us to unfair rate hikes. Bernie knows that climate change will not affect everyone equally,” the plan will say. “The carbon tax will also protect those most impacted by the transformation of our energy system and protect the most vulnerable communities in the country suffering the ravages of climate change.” Sanders will also promise to keep the pressure on industry for spreading misinformation about climate change, saying he will bring climate deniers to justice. “It is an embarrassment that Republican politicians, with few exceptions, refuse to even recognize the reality of climate change, let alone are prepared to do anything about it. The reality is that the fossil fuel industry is to blame for much of the climate change skepticism in America,” the plan will say. And Sanders will not back away from his assertions about climate change as a security threat – despite ridicule from Republican presidential contenders. “Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet,” the plan will say. Sanders’s call for a ban on new offshore oil drilling and fossil fuel projects on public lands won praise from groups such as Greenpeace and 350.org which have campaigned to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground to prevent dangerous climate change. “He has broken free of the corporate and 1% money that has held back climate policy for far too long,” Annie Leonard, director of Greenpeace US, said in an emailed statement. The plan appeared to be an attempt to regain ground lost to Clinton, as she took more ambitious positions on climate change. Sanders was stung in November when the League of Conservation Voters delivered an early endorsement of Clinton – even though he scored far higher than the secretary of state in the campaign group’s green ranking score card. Since the start of the campaign, the three Democratic presidential contenders have tried to outdo one another on their commitment to fighting climate change – making a striking contrast with Republican presidential candidates who deny climate change is occurring. All three Democratic candidates have promised more ambitious climate actions than Obama. O’Malley was the first off the blocks, unveiling his climate agenda in June in an opinion piece in USA Today, and continues to claim the strongest position by calling for a complete phase-out of fossil fuels by 2050. Clinton meanwhile has slowly edged towards a stronger position on climate change as the campaign progressed, belatedly coming out against the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and hunting for oil in Arctic waters. She moved to outflank Obama on his renewable energy plan by calling for the US to get 33% of its electricity from clean energy by 2027. Climate change occupies a far higher profile in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries than earlier contests – in part because of Obama’s focus on the environment in his second term in the White House. Democratic operatives see climate change as a potential wedge issue – a chance to paint Republicans as anti-science and out-of-touch for rejecting the science behind climate change."
"French diplomacy is fighting 23 years of entrenched positions in international climate talks as backroom negotiations continue with the aim of pushing through a draft agreement by Wednesday. In public, negotiators in Paris were staking out their positions on Tuesday, with the EU and 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries demanding regular reviews to ramp up the ambition of greenhouse gas reduction promises, and the biggest developing countries demanding additional financing pledges and rejecting calculations of how much the rich world has already provided.  But behind the scenes the French presidency is conducting crucial ministerial talks – with each negotiating bloc in turn and in small groups – with the aim of producing a draft trade-off deal by Wednesday as the basis for the final spurt of diplomacy to crunch a final agreement by the Friday deadline. Some recalcitrant countries – including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Malaysia – argued the talks should revert to the old all-in line-by-line negotiations, but the French stuck to their strategy. Negotiators expect that if the talks come down to just a few sticking points, the French could again involve world leaders by phone in the final hours to find a solution, reminding them of the promises they made in Paris last Monday.  On Tuesday the EU and 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries issued a statement demanding a binding agreement with five-yearly reviews to consider more ambitious targets for the world and individual countries. Current promises – if implemented – would result in catastrophic global warming of least 2.7C. The so-called ambition coalition also demanded clear rules for all countries to report on their emission reductions promises and have them reviewed.  But the biggest developing countries staked out their familiar stance, calling for extra financing and rejecting the idea that all countries should work towards a uniform set of reporting rules. Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has been in the thick of the talks as chair of the so-called “umbrella group” of developed countries, including Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. Australia’s priorities are to get a strong agreement that paves the way for all countries to report and review their promised emission reductions. Ministers and lead negotiators from China, India, Brazil and South Africa – the so-called Brics group – have rejected claims by rich countries that they were already well on the way to meeting a promise to provide $100bn a year in public and private finance to help poor countries reduce emissions and cope with already locked-in climate change. A recent OECD report suggested developed nations had already mobilised $57bn in aid and were on track for $62bn, but the Brics ministers and lead negotiators rejected that calculation and said the UN needed to establish a transparent system to keep track of commitments. “Double accounting does not reflect the real number,” said Prakash Javadekar, the Indian minister of state for environment, forests and climate change. China’s special representative for climate change, Xie Zhenhua, said a clear system for accounting for financing promises was “very important to enhance mutual trust”. “Developed countries say we provided $62bn and developing countries say we are not seeing the money ... so it is important to be clear how much is provided and by whom ... If we had such a system there would be no more questions like this,” he said. But the big developing countries were less enthusiastic about transparency on reporting emissions. “Transparency must continue to differentiate between developed and developing countries, the guidelines can be improved upon ... but we must first implement them and then take steps based on lessons learned,” Javadekar said. He said India did not intend to revisit its promised emissions reduction target until 2030. Other developing countries are willing to consider five-yearly reviews. And Xie said while the Brics countries supported regular stock taking and review, “the process must be facilitative, so through such process countries can learn from each others’ best practices ... so during this process there should be a mechanism to provide incentives to parties and ... the voluntary process ... should be non-intrusive and non-punitive”. A trade-off may emerge between developing countries’ demands for financing to reduce emissions and adapt to locked-in climate change, and the insistence by both rich nations such as the US and the EU and climate-vulnerable countries like the small island states that every country should be required to at least work towards the same reporting rules. Civil society groups are also pushing for a clear commitment to tough five-yearly reviews. Celine Charveriat, Oxfam International’s advocacy and campaigns director, said the agreement could not be an “empty shell”. “We cannot have a Paris outcome that does not provide a pathway [to more ambitious action necessary to limit global warming to 1.5C]. “The worst thing would be to give poor farmers around the world false hope that the leaders have listened to the science ... but at the end of the day to find there is nothing behind it.” The divisions between the developed world’s historical responsibility for greenhouse emissions and the developing world’s continued need for industrial development and incapacity to cope with the impacts of climate change were a key part of the original 1992 UN climate convention. But developed countries argue that developing countries are now major emitters and that the Paris accord should acknowledge the new global realities."

"As ministers from countries around the world fly in for the crunch second week of the UN climate talks in Paris there are still significant areas of disagreement, but also optimism at the talks that a deal can be done. The negotiating text has been pared back to just over 20 pages – a much better position than at the equivalent point at the Copenhagen talks in 2009. Here are some of the key individuals who will decide the outcome of the talks.  Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, has been involved in the long-running UN climate change talks since 1995, first as part of the Costa Rican delegation involved in crafting the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, and since 2010 as the UN’s climate change chief. Having experienced at first hand the travails of the Copenhagen summit in 2009, which ended in a deal but was derided for the scenes of chaos and vicious recriminations that marked its conclusion, she has been determined to learn from those mistakes. Her background – she comes from a well-connected political family in Costa Rica, where her father served as president three times and was credited with leading his country to stable democracy – has assisted her in gaining the confidence of developing countries, while liaising with the rich nations which have often dominated past talks. Her exhaustive knowledge of the cumbersome UN negotiating process has also proved invaluable, helping her to steer the development of the proposed new agreement through a series of lead-up meetings. The Paris conference is a make-or-break moment for the UN climate negotiations, which began in 1992. Current commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, declared by all the world’s major economies at Copenhagen, will run out in 2020, and this conference is aimed at putting plans in place for the next decade. This will be crucial, if the world is to stay within the threshold of a 2C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels, regarded by scientists as the limit of safety beyond which the effects of extreme weather are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. If Paris fails, the world will be left without an agreement on collective action to solve this global problem. Direct in manner, but with a sense of humour and moments of fire, Figueres has needed every ounce of energy and dynamism to bring these talks to their final stages. These will be her last UN negotiations: next year, she will step down from her role, leaving, she hopes, a lasting legacy. The tall thin figure of Todd Stern has been a fixture at UN climate negotiations for nearly 20 years, since he was asked to head the White House preparations for the Kyoto protocol in 1997. The State Department negotiator’s path through both worlds – the White House and the international climate negotiations – is closely linked to that of John Podesta, the powerful Democratic strategist who brought Stern into Bill Clinton’s White House. When George Bush was president, Stern joined a law firm and became a fellow at the Centre for American Progress, the thinktank founded by Podesta. In 2007, the two men teamed up for a report arguing the next US president should make a low carbon economy a top priority. Hillary Clinton brought Stern back into the administration in 2009 after she became secretary of state. Within the frequently histrionic world of climate negotiators, Stern, 64, a Harvard-educated lawyer and father of three sons, is seen as cautious and low-key, never flashy.  He chooses his words with a lawyer’s precision, and is unapologetic about his devotion to the minutest detail of the negotiations, including commas. But over the past six years, he has in his quiet and relentless way carried out a revolution in the way the negotiations have approached climate change. His first task was killing off the Kyoto protocol, a legally binding treaty which put the onus for fighting climate change almost entirely on rich countries such as the US, Europe and Japan. In tandem, Stern tried to end the rivalry between the two big climate polluters – the US and China. Stern made his first approach when he accompanied Clinton to China on her first visit as secretary of state. But the real movement came in 2013 after John Kerry became secretary of state.  The deal, announced at a summit in Beijing in November last year, was widely seen as a breakthrough for the talks – and for Stern’s designs to sweep away the last relics of Kyoto.  In its place, Stern made headway with the idea that all countries had to engage in fighting climate change, although developing economies would not be required to cut emissions until a later date.  Instead of the legal treaty of Kyoto, he argued the only way to fight climate change was on a volunteer basis, with each country setting its own targets for emissions reductions and other actions. Stern insisted peer pressure would eventually compel countries to deepen their cuts and so achieve the goal of limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. Only time will prove whether he was right. François Hollande, president of France, has been much in evidence for his country’s hosting of these crucial talks. Welcoming world leaders on the opening day, he made clear his determination to strike a deal: “Never have the stakes been so high, because this is about the future of the planet, the future of life.” Laurent Fabius, foreign minister and president of COP 21, has taken charge of the talks and the lead-up to them. In frequent meetings with counterparts in other countries throughout the year, on a variety of subjects, he has never failed to squeeze in the issue of climate change, and press governments to come forward with plans to reduce emissions and, in the case of developed countries, finance for poor nations. His has been the key role, finding out from other governments their targets and concerns, forming a bridge between nations that have historically had differences, and liaising closely with the UN to understand how the unwieldy process can be managed. The attacks on Paris, in which 130 people died and scores more were badly injured, marked a watershed. Fabius’s concerns switched immediately to the safety of the French people, and combating Isis, calling on other nations to act in concert. There was brief doubt as to whether the summit would go ahead. He made the decision to stop the planned march by civil society groups, because of security concerns. When the talks end, his role will revert to fighting terrorism as a key international priority. Fabius is joined by Ségolène Royal, minister of ecology, sustainable development and energy. She has championed the concerns of the poor nations at these negotiations, insisting repeatedly that the rich world must assist them in reducing emissions and coping with the effects of climate change. Economic development has sometimes been seen as running counter to environmental well-being. She has been determined to reconcile the two, arguing that no development can be durable if it damages the environment. On a personal level, relations between Hollande, Fabius and Royal have sometimes been strained. Hollande and Royal have four children together, parting in 2007 after Hollande began a relationship with Valérie Trierweiler. Relations between Fabius and Royal have also been said to be fractious at times. Fabius ran against Royal for the presidential nomination in 2007. She was defeated by Nicolas Sarkozy, with whose wife, Carla Bruni, Fabius was said to have had an affair. In the negotiation rooms at the talks, the key figure for the French is Laurence Tubiana. She has experience in international negotiations, advised former French prime minister Lionel Jospin, and has served as director of the International Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations. Two contrasting personalities lead China’s delegation at the climate talks. Su Wei is known for being one of the toughest negotiators around, described by one delegate as China’s “attack dog”. Minister Xie Zhenhua tends to strike a more flexible pose, often smiling and exchanging jokes with reporters and aides, and willing to consider compromises. “Good cop, bad cop,” is how one observer puts it. China’s position at these talks has changed markedly. Blamed for helping to cause the collapse of negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009, the country nevertheless signed a declaration there enshrining its first commitments on curbing emissions under the UN. In Durban, at a further round of talks in 2011, the proposal on the table was for a pathway to a new global agreement to kick in from 2020, when the Copenhagen commitments expire. That agreement is now the subject of the crunch conference in Paris. But if China had been allowed its way, Paris would never have happened. The talks at Durban carried on for 36 hours beyond their deadline, with non-stop marathon negotiating sessions. The EU, which proposed the 2015 agreement, had assembled a broad but fragile coalition of developed and developing countries. In the final hours, only two held out: China and India. China’s situation at the talks is complicated by political realities in Beijing. The country’s environment ministry pushes for domestic action on pollution, and the foreign ministry wants China to be seen as a constructive player on the international stage, but the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) traditionally takes a more hardline view at the UN. Its Durban stance was a result of that. Since then, however, after China finally backed down and agreed the timetable for Paris, the country has shown more public willingness to negotiate on climate change. Previously, for instance, China refused to set a date for when its emissions would peak. Late last year, President Xi Jinping stood with President Obama of the US to announce a peaking year, 2030, which is now its offering at the Paris talks. China has also contributed billions to the Green Climate Fund, for poorer developing countries. Having agreed a peaking year, and contributed to finance, China’s aim is now to hold developed countries to what it perceives as their obligations. Whether that involves blocking a deal judged too weak, or not in the Chinese national interest, will depend on Xie and Su, and their instructions from Beijing. India has taken one of the hardest public lines in the first week of these talks, and in the lead-up to them. The country was notably late in submitting its national plan on curbing emissions, known as an INDC - intended nationally determined contribution - which focused on renewable energy. Narendra Modi, leader of the world’s biggest democracy, has publicly argued that it would be “morally wrong” to let rich countries off the hook for their historical emissions. This line has been continued by India’s senior environment official, Susheel Kumar, of the ministry of environment, at the talks.   India’s negotiators have opposed phrasing in the text that would include developing countries that are “in a position to do so” among those making voluntary contributions to climate finance, and the inclusion of a 1.5C temperature limit which many of the poorest nations want. But its hard line has been counterbalanced by a strong focus on technology and energy. On the first day, India announced an alliance of 120 countries to pursue solar power, and said it would focus on other renewables as a way of reducing its future reliance on coal. These are potentially important achievements that could change the shape of emissions growth across the region. With its huge population and rapidly developing economy, India under Modi is proud of its role on the world stage, and will be pivotal at the talks. Minister Prakash Javadekar, who will lead for the second week, is said to have a friendly demeanour in meetings, and is more inclined to want to present India as a supporter of international processes than some of the “old guard” in the delegation. But if the government wants to be seen as a beacon for other developing nations, in the model of China, it will also have to show it is not harming the least developed countries by refusing to agree measures that would help them. Taking over as European commissioner for climate and energy just over a year ago, Miguel Arias Cañete had a full portfolio: plans for an unprecedented “energy union” across the EU; reinvigorating Europe’s energy industry amid the recession and Euro crises; and the COP 21. So far, he has pressed forward with all three. A genial man, with a background as a conservative politician, the Spaniard gives every appearance of enjoying his role, and his relationships with Latin America are undoubtedly helpful. Latin America will play a key role, as some of those nations – notably Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua – have sought to obstruct agreement in the past, while others are more willing to compromise. Cañete seems to have ridden out early controversies and objections to his role from campaigners, who were angered by his previous large shareholdings in oil companies, now sold. But his affable manner should not fool his counterparts into thinking the EU will be a pushover – he has stated firmly that Europe will not accept a weak deal. “There is no plan B if Paris should fail,” he told the Guardian earlier this year, and he has repeated his determination since.
